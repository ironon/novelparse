            Episode 471.





It's nighttime.

I thought about watching Charlotte until she fell asleep, but decided it was better not to.

The more I cared, the more guilty I felt, because I knew it would be better for Charlotte if I didn't watch.

And I couldn't just talk to Charlotte forever.

I took Sarkegar and Lucinil to the highest spire of the castle.

I couldn't think of a better place to take in the views of Rajak.

Sarkegar, as he used to be, when he came to see me.

She speaks in the form of a dainty female maid.

You think I'm burdened by the appearance of the devil.

"This is....... degraded....... No, this is the....... your Majesty rebuilt. new Darklands?"

"So to speak."

The city of Razak, not quite as deserted as the ecliptic, with lanterns lighting the streets, and the refugee neighborhoods, not quite as deserted, with guards roaming the streets with torches.

It is also the highest point of the royal castle, which was built on high ground in the first place.

I could see the ocean, the land behind me, and the horizon as far as the eye could see.

I could see sprawling urban areas and open farmland.

It was a bleak landscape.

What Sarkegar wanted was a land of demons, inhabited only by demons.

But I chose to blend in with the humans, and I was still rescuing humans and the demons of the continent.

Not entirely in the way Sarkegar would have wanted, but I have succeeded in establishing a nation of my own in the land of the dead.

Sure, it's a kingdom built on theft.

"God told me I'd see something like this before I died....... The truth is....... I didn't think so."

Sarkegar looks out over the city of Razak with its harbor and the vast expanse of refugee camps and farmland on the other side.

Sarkegar spins in place on the rooftop of the spire, pierced in all directions.

I look around, and then I look around, and then I look around, and then I look around, like I've been doing forever.

It was like a child seeing a new landscape for the first time.

"Your Majesty....... God, you can die now. Even if you die....... Even if you die blessing your sire's new world....... You are welcome....... Anytime......."

Sarkegar is smiling and crying like a child.

"Why think about dying, when there's so much to be done that you'll wish you hadn't."

"Whatever you want me to do, whatever you want me to do, even if it means dying of exhaustion, I will die laughing."

Sarkegar tugs at the hem of her skirt with both hands and bows her head in front of me.

"The great, the only, the sublime."

"Absolute Lord of the Darklands and all demons. And lord of men."

"Hail, hail, hail to the eternal king."

"This faithful dog, Sarkeghar."

"I'll take your orders anytime."

Sarkegar looks at me and smiles.

Sarkegarda, always smiling wickedly, conspiratorially.

But Sarkozy, with tears in her eyes and smiling as happily as ever, had taken on the appearance of a false human woman, not her own.

If I could visualize happiness right now, in this moment, it would look like this.

He looked happy enough to make me think so.

At first, I was honestly terrified.

I thought I might have to remove Sarkegar at some point.

And at some point, I felt guilty for not being able to fulfill Sarkegar's wish.

But when my wish failed, I was forced to do something I didn't want to do.

Eventually, I became Lord of the Darklands.

Because.

"Welcome back."

I hugged Sarkegar.

"My best friend."

I said what I've been thinking all along, my honest thoughts.



* * *



Sarkhegar descended the spire, wanting to see my Darklands more closely.

Is it really that good?

I knew Sarkegar would be pleased, but I didn't expect it to be that bad, so I was a little embarrassed.

"That's a lot of money for two years."

I smiled bitterly at Lucinil's words. While Sarkegar was thrilled with the rebuilding of Darklands, Rusinil seemed purely amazed that it had been possible in the short span of two years.

Sarkegar, Effinghauser, Loyard, and Roussinil.

These four were the ones who personally stopped Xavier Tana and the knights of Shanapelle as I was leaving the temple.

Loyard and Dr. Effinghauser were dead, and it was not until some time later that I was able to retrieve the other two.

"I know it's been....... It must have been hard for you."

"No, it was really good."

My warning that killing Lucinil and Sarkegar would make them permanent enemies.

Did the Empire really treat Sarkegar and Lucinil with such disrespect?

"Archdemon, even if it's two years at most and I've been through the wringer, how much of a part of my life is that going to be?"

Rusinil says he's lived so many years that even if it had been painful, it wouldn't have meant much.

That doesn't change the fact that Lucinil took the risk because of me.

Lucinil stares out at the city lights.

"You know what, Bali, I'm more excited about this."

"......What is it?"

"This neighborhood, you and me."

"Right."

I had come to the Edina Archipelago with Lucinil to meet Airi.

Lucinil would have known that the Edina Archipelago in that winter was very different from what it is today.

"What has changed so much in just two years?"

The city itself has never been so sprawling, not to mention the gigantic Great Hall, which didn't exist two years ago.

"Why does mortal time pass so quickly?"

In just two years, the landscape had changed. Lucinil thought it was amazing.

"It's so cozy and cute."

Rusinil covered his mouth and laughed as he said that.

"So more, sadly."

Mortal life has an end called death. Lucinil, therefore, seemed to be experiencing sadness in the midst of splendor.

"Why did you help me?"

"......?"

At my question, Rusinil shook his head.

Lucinil helped me.

It's safe to say I'm next in line for the council. She risked death for me.

I don't know if Lucinil had a reason to do this to me. All I knew was that she had helped me in some way and that she wanted to repay the debt.

Lucinil looks at me.

"When I was at the end of my rope, it was Elise who helped me become a vampire."

"ah......."

I thought that might be the case, but it was Elise who helped Lucinil when the homunculus reached the end of its physical life.

"So I was originally part of the Hwayo clan, and of course, you made a deal: you wouldn't take on a clan. You'd make me a vampire, but you wouldn't be responsible for me, so the lord of Demand, who was close to Eleris, took me in."

"And then it became a house of demand?"

"There was no clan to sublease to. I was the only one to receive it."

Lucinil turns on the stretch.

"But honestly, I helped you because I thought I owed you my life....... I don't know, I'm actually pretty good at anything."

I found that statement strangely funny.

"Being immortal inevitably leads to sloth. And with that sloth comes boredom, and with boredom comes giving up on life. I told you before, road vampires, for the most part, give up on life."

"I did."

"So I rarely have to do anything, but when I do, I do it well, and helping you was one of those things."

They risked their lives to help me.

That sounded a little, well, weird.

"What's the big deal, I'm a lot of things, just like Antony was a lot of things, and you can think of it that way."

"That weirdness is too convenient for me."

"Is that so?"

Of course, Antony's weirdness is just as convenient for me as it is unpleasant.

"Of course, if you work hard at something, you don't work hard for someone who's ugly or insignificant."

Once again, Lucinil turns on the stretch and takes a few deep breaths.

"You're pretty, cute, and quirky, and I guess immortals like me will inevitably find things like you cute when we get too old."

"We're too old, we know too well what works and what doesn't."

"Even if we didn't do it ourselves, we were living history in real time, not just in books."

"Those who dream too big."

"I know it's fleeting, I know it's impossible, I know it's too hard."

"So do we laugh at those who dream too big, who think it will never happen?"

"Actually, no."

"We've seen a lot of failures, but we've also seen very few successes."

"We have seen one man succeed where a hundred, or a thousand, have failed. We've seen rocks breaking eggs time and time again, but the number of broken eggs is immeasurable, and the number of eggs breaking rocks is immeasurable, even after all these years, only a handful."

"I've seen so many people fail and die trying to do things that were never supposed to be possible, and then someone succeeds."

"So I don't laugh at those impossible attempts."

"I pity those who fail."

"I thought those who succeeded were great."

"Immortals like me pity, pity, pity beings like you."

"So you want to do something about it."

"Do you understand, Archdemon?"

"So I don't want your story to be remembered as a sorry tale. I don't want to be on the sidelines of history like I've always been, I want to be a part of it."

"So the help she gave me, it doesn't really matter now."

Let's not make this a sad story.

Antirrhinus said that whether I die miserably or succeed, both are good.

I can't say the same for Lucinil, but she seemed to care about me.

Let's make sure my story doesn't end in tragedy.

It's not that I'd do anything for you, but there was something about those specific words that touched my heart.

Lucinyl turns on stretching.

"It was a short time, though....... It was a little frustrating not to be able to smell the night air outside once in two years."

I may have been comfortable, but I would never have been free.

"It's Reinhardt."

"Yes."

Archdemon, then Bali, then Reinhardt.

Lucinil calls me anything.

Then Lucinil looked at me and smiled.

"Thank you for giving me the night air again."

They think it's a gift.

I'm not resenting the fact that I didn't pay attention for two years, I'm grateful.

If only there were immortals like Lucinil in the world, it would be a pretty good thing.

In exchange for saving my life, I spent two years in prison.

You finally say thank you for a breath of cold night air.

I'm not supposed to be happy.

It's not a moment to be thankful for something yet.

"I'm more grateful."

I'm grateful to be able to see Sarkegar, Lucinil, and Charlotte again, albeit briefly.

Again, I was happy.



* * *



After Rusinil and Sarkegar left, I sat alone on the minaret's parapet, gazing out over the streets of Razak.

We did what we wanted to do.

The damage was inevitable, but it was literally inevitable.

The remnants of the Black Order fled at the death of their leader.

But.

I stare at the blackness beneath my feet.

It was a vague feeling.

There have been good things, and there have been terrible things.

I've been harsh on Ellen.

I thought it was the best thing to do in that situation, and I think I would do the same thing if I were in that situation again.

Ellen is in distress.

It was not a situation where we could talk to each other in a normal way.

I can't forget the look in Ellen's eyes as she looked up at me, horrified, frightened, and sad.

That look.

The tip of the trembling sword.

A mouth full of things I wanted to say, but couldn't bring myself to open.

They're all stuck in my head until it hurts.

"......."

As much as it bothered me, maybe even more, it bothered Ellen.

We've created something even more painful.

It hurt.

And the experience of physically hurting me must have traumatized Ellen even more.

I did it because I had to, but I'm sure Ellen is suffering.

I wanted to say sorry.

But will that day ever come?

I don't think that day will ever come.

I hold still and stare at the street lights.

Me and Ellen have different worlds to live in.

Here, I created a society of demons and humans.

Ellen must unite humanity by being the only ray of hope in a world filled with hatred, fear, and anger.

Ellen is more important than the emperor right now.

So Ellen and I have different worlds to live in.

For me and Ellen, the best we can do for each other is to live like this, not knowing where the other is.

If you encounter it, you have to fight it, even if it's forced, like you just did. You have to put that fight on display for people to see.

We are the enemy.

A warrior is stronger than a demon, or so people should believe.

People must believe that the devil cannot attack the empire and humanity because they are afraid of the hero, and that one day the hero will defeat the devil.

So I intentionally gave Ellen a critical hit.

But what if.

You say the fight was necessary and that I purposely played the sore loser.

Really soberly.

Take the emotion out of it.

I knew today what the outcome would be if I really fought with Ellen.

"......."

If you really want to fight Ellen Artorius.

If that day ever comes.

If it's a hundred, it's a hundred, and I lose.

Such an objective truth, I realized after today's unintentional fight.
