I ended up doing my early morning workouts alone.

I could have done it with Ellen, but I didn't.

They say you don't know what someone means until they're gone.

We'd always trained together without saying much since I'd gotten stronger, so the void was pretty big when he was gone.

It made me realize that Adriana was important to me.

I realized that I should take Redina to see her.

The people in Club Grace and a few of the sophomores seemed to be reeling from Adriana's sudden departure, but I didn't care what they did.

Are they going to meet Adriana, and will she meet them?

It was out of my hands, so I decided not to think about it.

I thought about catching the people who were spreading malicious rumors about Adriana and making them pay, but I didn't.

Adriana wouldn't want that.

Doing nothing about this would be the last thing I would do out of respect for Adriana.

There.

How did the Archduke's misunderstanding get resolved?

So it was back to workouts, training, and classes as usual.

I don't know what's going on with the Orbis class issue, but the emergency school closures were getting pretty long.

To fix the problem at the root, we'd have to uproot it, which would effectively deconstruct and reconstruct the Orbis class.

Many would be expelled, and many teachers would be fired.

And.

"Are you ready, Reinhard? You don't have to come, I can do this alone."

Olivia was a bit reluctant, but I couldn't let her go alone.

She kept insisting on going alone, I kept insisting on going with her, and eventually I won.

Thank you.

I could tell that Olivia was troubled by Adriana's dropping out, but after all, she cares about my work.

"I don't know what to expect, but I'm ready."

"Hmmm, I believe you."

Olivia Ranze.

Dress mode.

"Oh my gosh, look how they can't even make eye contact. Am I that pretty?"

"Yes, she's beautiful."

"......Uh-oh. I never thought you'd say that."

The flirtatious man is usually shy when it comes to flirting, but Olivia Lanze, in an off-the-shoulder dress, was even more radiant than usual.

My shameless compliment, followed by the main dish, made Olivia blush and flutter her hands.

Olivia is in a dress. I'm just in my royal class uniform.

Sponsorships.

A very strong opportunity for donations to the Magic Society budget.

I go to a party. Olivia offers me her hand.





"Will you escort me?"

"Just this once."

I took Olivia's hand in mine.

"Eh, that's not how escorts work!"

-vaginal

Of course, it wasn't an escort, but a hand-holded dragging, which freaked Olivia out.

Basically, it's a sponsorship meeting that only students in the 4th grade and above can attend. It takes the form of a party, where they talk about sponsorship in a subtle tone while farting and laughing.

The Patronage is an official event of the Temple and is held in the ballroom of the Temple General Headquarters.

Normally, anyone without a temple pass would not be able to enter, but in this case, access is limited to sponsored event attendees.

I thought about bringing some of the Magical Research Society, especially Harriet. She's the Grand Duchess of the Duchy of St. Thuan, and she's so talented, it should be easy to get her sponsorship.

But after much deliberation, I came to the sponsorship event alone.

I didn't want to put Harriet in this position, as it was something I could explain to the members of the Magic Society.

It's not a bad position, but it's a whining position for money. I didn't want to subject Herriot to that experience.

I was on my way to a sponsorship event with Ceres and Olivia.

"Normally, we're a special class sponsor, so we should have an Orbis class, but with the way things are going, we're going to have to......."

"Only royal class, huh?"

"Yeah, I think so."

Normally, we would compare the two special classes and back the one that looks more promising, but the Orbis class is closed.

Ceres van Owen also wore a dress, and while she was quite impressive, Olivia Lanchester stole the show.

"Now, don't keep looking......."

When I continue to stare, she averts her gaze as if embarrassed. Olivia crosses her fingers, unable to look at me.

This guy.

I wonder who the hell she is. She has the audacity to stare. Ceres stares at Olivia, who stares back.

Normally, I would have looked up to you immensely.

Since then, I've noticed that Ceres sometimes feels sorry for Olivia.

Well.

I know the feeling. I can't believe how ridiculous he is sometimes, although he was nice enough to offer to take donations for an underclassmen's club that had nothing to do with him called the Magical Research Society.

In the end, Olivia Ranze is the one who has me to thank.

Olivia doesn't go to sponsorship events because she doesn't need sponsorship, but she's making an exception this time.

And, of course, Ceres Van Owen, who doesn't have to go to sponsorship meetings, but should because she's student body president.

She flips through the list she's holding.

"Patrons come from all walks of life, from nobles and giants to knights and templars and magic councils."

"I suppose so."

"If there's one organization that might be willing to sponsor your magical research group, it would be the Magical Society, right?"

"Maybe."

"It doesn't necessarily have to be magic-related, don't the Templars have mages in their ranks?"

Olivia had a different take on Ceres' comment, and it made sense. It wouldn't be the only group that would be interested in a magical society.

"So let's just name the four biggest names in the room."

"Crusader Knight Commander Elayon Bolton."

"Sangtriden, Vice President of the Magic Society."

"Captain of Shanapell, 1st Knights of the Empire. Saviolin Tana."

"Merchant Guild Guildmaster Owen de Getmora."

The previous Crusader Grand Master, Revereer Ranze, has been deposed, and the next Grand Master of the Crusade is in attendance. Mr. Elayon Bolton, whoever he may be. Olivia's reluctance is palpable.

Her stepfather, Crusader Master Revere Lance, is one thing, but Olivia hates the Crusade itself. Even if she were to succeed him, she wouldn't want to be in his presence.

"I can go by myself."

I said, but Olivia shook her head.

"It's okay, it's not like I wasn't expecting you."

Olivia Ranze is a real sweetheart.

Crusader Knightmaster, Vice President of the Magic Society, 1st Knightmaster of the Empire. Guildmaster of the Merchants' Guild.

It's clear that even if we could get just one of those four to sponsor us, it would be a huge amount of money.

But I don't like the Crusaders, and the Merchant Guilds are kind of creepy.

I don't know about the Wizarding Society, but they might be able to sponsor it.

What about the Imperial 1st Knights?

I don't know everything, but there was one name I recognized.

Captain of the Knights of Shanapelle, 1st Knights of the Empire.

Saviolin Tana.

Naturally, Swordmaster.

No, it's more than that.



* * *



While Temple students have been called into battle in the wake of the Gate Crisis, there are other combatants as well. Chief among them are the Templars, and the Shanapels, the continent's premier knightly order, have also seen their fair share of action.

Because of their unfamiliarity with combat, many Templars take students to teach them to fight and battle in the field.

Along the way, Violin Tana teaches Ludwig many lessons. At that point, Ludwig has the Alsbringer and is treated as a very important person.

Ludwig and Ellen Artorius.

The two are incorporated into Saviolin Tana's immediate unit and fight.

It's only fitting that the Empire's greatest knight should be teaching Master Alsbringer and Master Rament, who are still new to combat.

She is cold and distant, and she treats Ludwig very harshly. She whips Ludwig by comparing him to Ellen, who is good at everything.

With the world at stake, Saviorin Tana had no choice but to treat Ludwig more harshly than he deserved.

It's better to be alive than dead, and with a weak body and mind, death is the worst possible outcome.

Ellen, the savant of all things, had nothing to teach Tana, the violinist, but Ludwig had a lot to teach her.

Throughout the battle, Savior Tana teaches Ludwig many things, and she dies saving his life near the end.

Ludwig becomes a Swordmaster in the process.

Saviolin Tana, a very important post-Gate character.

I never thought I'd see him in this position.

"Okay, let's go in, shall we?"

I didn't expect to see Ludwig and Ellen, and I didn't expect to see Olivia Ranze.

"That's a lot of people."

"Right?"

There are about a half-dozen Royal Class students in fourth grade and above, and not all of them attend.

But it seemed like there were over a hundred non-students.

"If everyone who actually wanted to come came, it would be over a thousand people."

And that's just the tip of the iceberg, Ceres added. As the Empire's premier educational institution, Temple's best students are the future of the Empire.

There are so many people who want to invest in them or line them up. Or scout them after they graduate. Promising knights, entrepreneurial talents.

All that talent has to be used somewhere.

Students greeted supporters they already knew, some for the first time and others for the first time.

And all eyes were on us for appearing there.

To Olivia Ranze, to be precise.

A person who renounced her faith but was famous as a saint of Eredian.

The mere fact that she'd dropped everything to be in the presence of the Crusaders' leader was sobering.

Honestly, there are times when I'd rather ignore all that and just look at Olivia Lanchester in a dress.

Olivia smiled thinly, as if she was used to that kind of stare.

What the hell, I'm not pecking at this again.

He's a weird guy to look at.

"Do we need to do anything official?"

"Hmm, not really, just relax and go with it."

I was worried that I was going to have to get up on a podium and be like, "Who am I, give me some money?

But if you don't have that, how do you start the conversation with your backers?

However, contrary to my fears, someone approached me first.

"I can't believe you're here."

"You're not in a place you shouldn't be, are you?"

"Sure."

I didn't recognize his face, but his robes gave me an idea of his identity.

Current Crusader Knightmaster Elayon Bolton.

Olivia picked up a glass of champagne from her tray and took a light sip, smiling.

Alcohol?

Correct.

Olivia was an adult.

"Can't you change your mind?"

"Sure."

The Crusader leader still seemed to lament Olivia Lance's departure, but he knew her resolve was too firmly established for any further prodding, so he left with a brief bow.

Olivia Ranze would be too good to pass up. Leverier Lance says Olivia ticks all the boxes.

The people you pick and choose to lead your next crusade.

But Olivia can't go back.

Ceres looked at Olivia with pity; she, too, lived by faith in the Great Gods.

Ceres seemed to be saddened by Olivia's abandonment of her faith.

"Some things are more solidified over time."

"It's ......."

Olivia smiled as she told Ceres that.

It's not just that I'm disappointed in the Crusaders.

Since the Tiamata incident, Olivia has learned about faith and the reality of God. That demons don't exist, and that the gods and demons are actually the same thing.

That the way you believe only determines your power.

Knowing that God's face had no expression, Olivia Ranze could not have faith again.

I decided to abandon my faith because of the human problem, but I realized that God has just as much of a problem.

Olivia would never return to her faith and allegiance to God. As such, she would never consider joining the Crusaders.

The unknown seniors in the royal class were chatting with various patrons.

Ceres was the student council president, so she went off to do something else, leaving me with Olivia.

"I'm guessing most of the seniors here are magic majors who need money?"

Olivia nodded at my words.

"That's one thing, but we also have kids coming in to decide what they want to do after graduation."

"Hmmm....... Are you waiting for someone to come up with a better offer?"

"Yes. Children from commoner backgrounds are sometimes promised knighthoods."

The Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan was right.

Some places will even promise you a knighthood to get you to join their royal class.

For current students, it's a place to network for sponsorships, and for those who are nearing graduation and don't plan on going to graduate school, it's a place to find work.

We don't know what the ransom for a Royal Class graduate is, but we do know it's a lot.

How's my ransom.

I don't actually think so, but Mr. Effinghauser once said that I was the best person at Temple.

"......."

In the back of the ballroom, scarily enough, I could see a cold-looking man talking to someone.

Dr. Effinghauser.

A royal class teacher attending a sponsorship event. I mean, I know it's not unheard of, but seeing him at a party is.

I couldn't hear what they were talking about, but I could tell by the stern look on his face that it wasn't a pleasant conversation. I can't imagine him having a pleasant conversation either.

"Okay. Shall we go fishing for money then?"

Olivia says, smiling brightly.

"Maybe you shouldn't say ...... like that."

When you say it like that, it sounds like you're here to rip them off.

......Although the results are similar.

"Don't be too disappointed. Reinhardt."

What?

I thought we were supposed to be able to make money here?
