            Episode 313.





Putting on a dress and applying makeup to get ready for Miss Temple isn't something you can do all day.

After taking off her dress and removing her makeup, Ellen took a shower.

Riana didn't just go over the dress code and makeup, she also had me practice my facial expressions. She says you have to be prepared.

It didn't seem like she had done much, but the unfamiliarity of it all made Ellen feel very tired now. Both physically and mentally.

That didn't mean I didn't like it.

I realized that I was discovering a completely different version of myself that I didn't even know I had, so I looked in the mirror and thought, "Is this me?" dozens of times a day.

Ellen dried all of her hair and laid back down on her bed.

Tomorrow is the start of the Miss Temple contest.

-curl

Ellen narrowed her eyes at the rumbling in her stomach.

Normally, it's time for a late-night snack with Reinhard. Ellen thinks of Riana's firm caution.

"You, don't pick up anything tonight.

"......Why?

"I know you're not gaining weight, but what if you eat something the night before and your face is puffy the next day?

"......I'm not sure.

"If you're not going to eat it anyway, don't eat it. Maybe another day, but not today.

"......Yes.

I'm not saying starve yourself, I'm saying don't eat late at night, but you can do that. I can handle it for a day.

But routines are scary.

-cough

"......."

When you don't eat at the time you usually eat something, and your body is telling you that you shouldn't.

What's more, when someone tells you not to do something, it makes you want to do it even more.

I've gone to bed without eating a midnight snack quite a few times, and now I'm even hungrier because I know I shouldn't be eating today.

Normally, Ellen is very self-controlled. But even when she does eat, she tends not to gain weight due to her physical activity and constitution, and there is always plenty of food in the Royal Class dormitory. She even stuck with Reinhardt, who would do anything for her.

Ellen realizes that she has rarely been able to resist eating lately.

Still, I must do better tomorrow. I can't keep my hunger down this long.

I'm trying to force myself to fall asleep, but I can't.

Maybe it was the moonlight streaming through the window. Ellen scrambled out of bed to draw the curtains.

And.

Holding the curtains closed, Ellen could see the street outside her dorm.

In the dark, under the moonlight.

You see two familiar faces.

Reinhard and Herriot de Saint-Ouen.

They were walking, hand in hand.

"......."

Ellen stays still, watching the scene from inside her room.

Harriet walking beside Reinhardt with her head down in shame, and Reinhardt walking beside her, holding her hand slightly.

Ellen watched the spectacle, frozen in place.

Hold hands.

What a special act that is.

I've held her hand as many times as I can, and I've hugged her as many times as I can.

I've done it myself. I've been friends with Reinhard for as long as I can remember.

So, it falls into the category of things that friends do, and that's how it should be understood.

You have to understand that it's perfectly acceptable.

But.

Ellen can't take her eyes off their clasped hands.

Already.

Was it taken away?

No.

A long time ago.

It's an illusion to think that there's something that only you can reach.



"Long time no see!



Actually, already.

A long time ago.

Is that what happened?

Why are those two.

Substitution.

A hand is something you can hold.

It's a hand I've held many times myself.

I thought it was my privilege to be able to touch Reinhardt, so when I saw that he and Harriet were merely holding hands.

My heart is like, why is this.

Is it precariously close to breaking.



'Me, me, you know....... Really, really....... sometimes.'

'I think you're really, really mean.......'



Something Herriot had said once echoed in Ellen's head.

Ellen suddenly realizes that Harriet has always felt this way.

In a place you don't know. Watching from afar as they create stories and memories you don't know.

You've created a relationship that you can't break.

You have to watch it, and you can't do anything about it.

So this is what it feels like.

You feel betrayed, you don't know what to do, you're angry, you're upset, and you're frustrated.

Herriot summarized this feeling in one word: cheesy.

I don't think that's the best way to put it.

Ellen sees them walking back to the dorm.

It may be too late.

She's doing what she has to do. There is no need or reason to hate her. To hate that, Ellen would have to have been hated by Herriot long ago.

Ellen tries to convince herself that Harriet is doing her own thing, and that she doesn't have to hate her for it.

So, you do what you need to do.

You just have to be good tomorrow. If Reinhardt sees himself tomorrow, he might be a little different than he is today.

We'll talk about this and that, and maybe we'll do things a little differently.

That's it.

Today is today, and tomorrow is tomorrow.

Ellen squeezed her eyes shut, trying to erase the lingering images of the two of them from her mind.



* * *



That night.

I swung my sword in the smoke screen.

No Cliffhanger, no Ellen. So I banged on the scarecrow for the first time in a while. I could have asked Tana, the violinist, to teach me, but it was getting late, and I knew I wouldn't be able to get to bed on time if she did.

So, I swung my water sword at the scarecrow.

-Puck!

"......itis."

Your water sword is broken.

I don't think I've ever been that into swords as much as I am into trance.

What it is.

I forgot the time.

I was already well past my standard bedtime. It was time to call it a night, even with Saviolin Tana's lessons.

My whole body was drenched in sweat.

I gathered up the remains of my broken water lily sword and tossed it into the trash, then opened the window to the smokehouse.

A stinging cold breeze brushed against my cheeks and sweaty clothes.

Me Now.

Apparently, you're upset.

What should I do?

I couldn't figure it out.

It was well past my bedtime, and I knew I'd break it again if I tried to swing it, so I decided to get cleaned up and get some sleep.

I thought about doing something, but I didn't feel like doing anything by myself without Ellen.

"Uh."

I walked down the hallway and bumped into someone. He looked at me and scratched his head.

It wasn't anyone else who ran into me, but Bertus.

Aren't you busy managing your horsepower train? What's going on in the dorms at this hour?

"What, you're not going to bed until this time?"

Bertus said what I would have said.

"Some from the haze."

"...... Training late at night on a festival. That's amazing."

Bertus smirked.

"What about you?"

"Oh....... I've been working a bit, and now I'm going to take a break."

The festivities aren't over yet, are we done with the Zodiacal Horsepower Train?

Whether it was the vigil or too much work, Bertus had dark circles under his eyes. You shouldn't be praising me for training during the festival, shouldn't you? You're more uptight than usual.

"Oh, I heard you won the tournament. Congratulations."

"Uh....... Yeah."

Bertus patted me on the shoulder and walked toward his room. If the fatigue on his iron mask was any indication, he'd had a rough couple days.

He was about to go on his way, but then he looked back in my direction as if he suddenly remembered something.

"Oh....... Wait a minute."

"Uh....... Why?"

A cold sweat breaks out all over my body.

All the others passed with flying colors.

This one is not yet.

This is the first time he's seen me since he saw me cross-dressing.

Bertus narrows his eyes and glares at me.

No?

You're not recognizing me, are you? Honestly, I mean, we've met face-to-face, but it's been a quick glance.

"Hmmm......."

Bertus stared at me, frowning, and then shook his head.

"No, you look a little tired."

Bertus made a spine-chilling noise and went back into his room.



* * *



Entering his dormitory room, Bertus dragged his heavy body through the water, bathed, and flopped down on his bed.

Manage the operation of horsepower trains during festivals.

I didn't think it was a big deal. The Horse Train is the most important mode of transportation on the Yellow Road, and even at this time of year, riders come from all continents.

Goro.

Some people have never seen or heard of a horsepower train in their lives.

Children cry because they see a monster running, and adults run away in a panic.

This one's for you.

Even in the far corners of the continent, there is such a thing as status.

If you're willing to travel all the way to the ecliptic to see the temple festival, you've got the money to pay for the warp gate.

That's why, in general, those who are more retarded in their own region come to the ecliptic.

Not to mention, there's a whole bunch of people who want to know why there's no noble carriage on the magic train. There are plenty of people who ask how they can use the same transportation as commoners.

It's almost laughable to think of ants doing sequencing, but Bertus had to be good at it.

It was stressful trying to resolve every incident and mishap as smoothly as possible.

I didn't even get a chance to rest, so I went back to my dorm, thinking I'd call it a night.

Bertus's head is about to explode.

But when I looked at Reinhardt, something clicked.

You're too caught up in work to think about it, but you remember the girl you ran into last time.

The moment I saw Reinhardt, I immediately thought of that silver-haired girl.

Unforgettable.

Bertus can't get the look off his face for the rest of his life when he makes the ridiculous mistake of spewing black tea in the face of a woman he's never met before.

'Looks alike, apparently.

I thought maybe I was mistaken because I was tired, but after thinking about it, there's a definite resemblance.

Of course, you'd have to stand them up next to each other to get the full picture.

There's no doubt that the silver-haired girl and Reinhardt look a lot alike.

But Bertus's thinking takes a strange turn.

First.

Bertus is busy and unaware of the festivities. At best, he knows that Reinhardt won the first grade tournament.

So we don't know who the silver-haired girl is, and we don't know that she competed in the Temple pageant.

So, to Bertus, a silver-haired girl is just a silver-haired girl.

Two very different things.

But it's similar.

He even looks like he's got a bit of a mouth.

I was curious about the silver hair, so I asked her about it, and she said it was dyed.

And Reinhardt is from the streets.

"Does Reinhardt have a brother or sister?

It's entirely possible that Reinhardt didn't know he had blood relatives, even if he did.

Just ask Reinhardt.

Do you have a younger brother or sister?

Of course, you'll get a don't know or a yes or no answer, but Reinhardt will wonder why you're even asking.

"Well, maybe not, maybe not.

I'm just wondering if it's possible to have an unnecessary human resemblance.

Reinhardt would be pretty disappointed if you told him that you met someone you thought was your brother or sister, when it wasn't.

'Let's talk about it.......'

You don't even have to tell Reinhardt.

If it's true, it could lead Reinhardt to his lost blood relatives.

If not, it's just a matter of returning the handkerchief that wasn't returned.

Thinking it was nothing more than a frivolous task, Bertus slowly became immersed in Suma.

Friday.

Today we have the Miss Temple contest and the finals of the unlimited weight tournament.

Olivia Ranze, who has to participate in both, will be very busy. The Royal Class first-years didn't seem to have much interest in an unlimited tournament starting with the quarterfinals now that their classmates aren't competing.

Ellen, Riana, and Kliffman were busy preparing for the contest.

However, Ellen saw me in the morning and just stared at me.

"Today......."

You know what to say.

"Why don't you go?"

"......Yes."

Ellen watched all of my tournament matches. Even if she didn't, there's no reason she can't go to the Miss Temple contest today.

I'm still not sure what to do about Mr. Temple, though I'm sure I could write a retrospective and make Cliffman Mr. Temple.

There's no reason I shouldn't go to the contest. Ellen looks at me hesitantly, then with a look of determination on her face.

"...... come on."

"Okay, be prepared."

"Yes."

When the contest is over, I wonder if I'll have anything to say.

He had that look on his face.

Ellen left with those words and went off somewhere with Riana to get ready.

While the others were off to their own festivities, I decided to go it alone during the day.

Without anyone present.

Now I'm going to watch the finals of an unlimited tournament, away from the attention of my classmates. I'm sure some of them will be there, but I'm going alone.

Olivia has a lot to be sorry for. She's always there for me, and she'd do anything for me, but she always puts me down. Yesterday, she even cheered for Harriet in public.

Just because you're a jack-of-all-trades doesn't mean you're a master of none.

I don't know if any of you guys are going to watch the finals separately, but I was going to watch the finals of an unlimited tournament without going with anyone.

Even if you start with the quarterfinals, there are only three matches left. So even if you didn't have to sit for very long to watch the final, it would be quite short.

-Wow!

The cheers from the crowd were incredible.

It doesn't change the fact that Herriot lost.

But just because the result was what I thought it would be doesn't mean the process was what I thought it would be.

Just as my tournament had its own twists and turns, the Unlimited tournament had some upsets.

Olivia has only dropped one set so far, and that was the one that Herriot took.

I was waiting for the game to start when I heard someone calling out to me from behind.

"Reinhard, you're here for the finals too, right?"

"Oh, Charlotte."

It was Charlotte.

Even if I was watching it alone, it was zoned so I was bound to run into someone if they came by.

Why would Charlotte need to watch the finals anyway?

The reasoning behind this was simple.

"I see you're here too?"

"Yeah."

Apparently, it's not Charlotte, it's Saviolin Tana who misses her. She can't leave Charlotte's side, but she wants to see the final.

Charlotte's not stupid, so she probably read Tana's mood and said, "Let's go watch the finals.

"If you want to go, I'll go. Why are you here alone?"

"Oh, just."

"Really?"

I figured I'd rather see it on my own than bring someone with me, but I wasn't going to move my seat just because I ran into it.

Naturally, Charlotte and Saviolin Tana sat next to me.

Charlotte looked around and crossed her arms.

"Hmmm."

"Why?"

"Huh? No......."

This neighborhood is reserved for VIP seats in the Royal Class.

That said, there are other VIP seats available.

Just now, Charlotte was looking at the VIP seats for dignitaries.

"Lord Bolton."

"Bollton?"

I shook my head, and Saviolin Tana looked at me.

"Didn't we say hello at the last fundraiser?"

"You mean at the fundraiser?"

I'm sure there's a name or two I've forgotten after saying hello at a sponsorship event. Bolton? Who's that?

"Hmm.

"Hey, you have a bad memory.

For a moment, I see that thought pass through Saviolin Tana's eyes.

"Sir Elayon Bolton, the current leader of the Crusader Knights."

"Ah."

Right.

You've heard the name before. Elayon Bolton, the new leader of the Crusader Knights after Leviathan Lance was deposed.

I didn't know who he was, and he didn't sponsor me, so I forgot about him.

Charlotte gave a subtle smile.

"I looked to see if it came yesterday, and it didn't, but it did today. Well, it's finals, after all."

"You don't think ...... would want to see Olivia win?"

"Well, ....... I'm not sure what Lord Bolton thinks, but it's a bit of a sight to behold."

How would the current leader of the Crusader Knights feel about seeing a potential next religious leader renounce his faith and win a tournament without divine power?

This can't be good. I remembered the name and recognized the face.

Not quite the same as Levereer Ranze, but just as stern and stubborn. He was dressed in robes, not knightly armor of course, and surrounded by an entourage of what appeared to be paladins, all of whom stood still and watched the action.

Saviolin Tana, who had been listening to us, shook her head.

"I don't know about Olivia, but maybe she's rooting for the other side."

"The other one?"

"Final Four, don't you know?"

"I don't remember any of them, except for Olivia."

Charlotte laughed wryly, as if she didn't even remember something that had nothing to do with her.

"We have a finalist who is certain to join the Crusaders after graduation."

"Oh....... Really?"

"I suppose it's something you might want Olivia to win."

Olivia's abandonment of her faith is inevitable.

So, the next Crusader might want to take the win from Olivia, who doesn't even use holy power.

Certainly, there were a few wannabe paladins in the Unlimited tournament field. Most of them were a force to be reckoned with.

Jordan Windsor, Royal Class 6th Grade A-3.

Radia Schmidt, Royal Class 6th grade, B-2.

Radia Schmidt.

The person who wondered what Olivia and I were talking about.

Someone who seems like a good person, but has a strange feeling about them.

He was a prodigy, using holy power with magical enhancements.

By the way.

Olivia is also a year in, so Radia Schmidt and Olivia are actually friends who have been at Temple for a long time.

Do you think they have bad feelings for each other because Olivia left her faith or something?

It's entirely possible that Radia Schmidt would be jealous of Olivia if she were to join the Crusaders.

In many ways, it would have been a comparison. As good as Radia Schmidt is, she wouldn't have been able to beat Olivia in the end.

If Radia Schmidt had been a member of Grace, I would have seen her once, but my first encounter with her was a brief conversation in front of my dorm.

If there was always someone above you who was a perfect match for your talents, that would be a pain in the ass.

While we were chatting about this and that, the moderator started running the contest.

-Royal fifth grader who has only dropped one set so far! Olivia Ranze!

Olivia teleports onto the field as the crowd cheers.

Despite the slight mishap yesterday, Olivia had regained her easygoing smile.

The difference is that Olivia, who had been fighting with her bare fists, is now wielding a sword.

Maybe he realized that he didn't need to draw penalties in the semifinals. Or maybe they realized that if they let their guard down like they did yesterday, they could lose a set.

The quarterfinalists were two sixth graders from Royal and a fifth grader from Orbis.

The Royal Class side was all Temple High School seniors.

Olivia Ranze's quarterfinal opponent is a fifth grader from Orvis. Melan Beniere.

It must be heartbreaking to have your Orbis class disappear right before you graduate.

The Orbis class was the cradle of revolutionary forces, and most of the students and teachers involved either dropped out or left the teaching profession.

Those who remain are either those who have not been subsumed, or those who have been subsumed but have decided to remain in the temple.

Revolutionary Forces.

It makes my head spin every time I think about it.

Regardless of my concerns, the first match of the quarterfinals was about to begin.

The process wasn't that important.

3:0

Olivia Ranze won the match.



* * *



Herriot only had a chance against Olivia because she was using magic, or because Olivia was stronger with a sword.

Her opponent seemed to struggle, but she was no match for Olivia.

Most importantly, my opponent looked frustrated, but not in a defeated way, as if he knew this was going to happen.

Next match in the quarterfinals.

Jordan Windsor, Royal Class 6th Grade A-3.

Radia Schmidt, Royal Class 6th grade, B-2.

They've made it to the quarterfinals, so there's nothing wrong with their skill. I've seen Radia Schmidt and Jordan Windsor play.

Radia Schmidt tends to lose with double buffs, and Jordan Windsor is pretty good even without access to holy power.

Obviously, they're very good players that I can't even compete with at this level, and I don't think Herriot would have been able to win against them.

Olivia is overly monstrous, but so are the other Royal Class upperclassmen.

It's a hand-picked group of people who have been honing their skills for six years. So even though Olivia is an off-the-shelf monster, they're monsters, too.

Talent doesn't run away with you.

Lastly, just because Erhi is surplus now doesn't mean he'll be surplus in six years. He seems to be trying these days, so there's a chance he'll awaken to the enchantment by year three, and another three years from there he'll be an unlimited tournament-ready monster.

Olivia Ranze was originally a classmate of the sixth graders, and would have been in Temple with them the entire time, except for the fifth grade when she left to serve in the Demon War.

So I was actually more like a sixth grader.

Your fellow Royal Class classmates face off in the finals of an unlimited tournament.

I thought it would be a fun and interesting experience.

If it weren't for the Gate debacle, I could see myself and Ellen facing off in the finals of an unlimited tournament when I moved up a grade.

......, but you'll probably lose.

I could see myself making it to the finals and losing to Ellen in the finals.......

Honestly, I didn't think it would be that offensive.

The second game of the quarterfinals was actually pretty exciting, despite my expectations.

-Take care, Radia.

-Take care of me too.

They smiled and greeted each other, wondering if things weren't so bad between them. Despite their different classes, they seemed to be in good spirits after spending so much time together.

But only for a moment.

Their faces hardened.

As if on cue, the jovial mood is gone, and a scavenger hunt begins.

Melan Beniere, the fifth-grader in Orbis who was just triple-teamed by Olivia, is probably a much better player than I am.

The two fighting there now are sixth graders at Temple.

This is the last time we'll see each other in a tournament like this.

Regardless of how they normally get along, this is the last time they'll be pitting their wits against each other on this kind of specialized battlefield.

So let's be real with each other.

-Woof!

Blue magic coursed through Jordan Windsor's body. It didn't feel like an explosion of flame like Ellen's.

That's the exact opposite.

It feels like we've gone all in on operational stability.

It feels like a well-honed blade, compressed and refined, without any unnecessary horsepower.

It's not about scale.

It's an extremely efficient form of disenchantment, using only the right amount of power where it's needed. Perhaps it's Jordan Windsor's style of enchantment that Ellen and I should emulate the most.

Radia Schmidt's case was a little different.

She slammed her sword down, suddenly, on the arena floor.

-Bam!

The metallic sword pierced the stone floor, and white threads of energy began to rise from the floor and wrap around the sword.

The white glow that enveloped her sword soon began to envelop her body as well.

That wasn't all.

Radia's body was emitting not only white light, but also blue magic power.

Divine power strengthens the body and supports magical enhancements.

A way to add strength to strength.

It's not my place to be self-suggestive, but that double entendre is absurd. Saviolin Tana watches the spectacle and says nothing.

"Divine Power of Als, the War God......."

I had already seen Radia Schmidt play, so I knew she was using the Holy Power of Als.

"The divine power of Als has....... nothing important."

"Yes."

I know, I know.

Als, the War God.

"Divine Power, unable to use the power of healing, instead focusing everything on offense......."

While Tuan's powers are not limited to healing, most divine powers can use healing to some degree.

However, the priests of Als, the war god, do not have the power to heal.

A power that specializes solely in destroying and crushing.

A destructive force that specializes in killing and slaughter.

That is the divine power of the War God.

Having absorbed enough of the divine power from the earth, Radia Schmidt draws her sword, a young sword of white light, and stares down her opponent, bathed in blue and white light.

-go.

-Yes.

They're not just superhuman, they're superhuman.

It's the epitome of royalty: two monsters clashing.

-Quack!

Sword clashed with sword, and I could practically see the shockwave as it cracked the atmosphere.

Given the level of confrontation, it was clear that the weapons issued were powerful artifact-level weapons that could withstand any fight.

And so it was a true battle of the superheroes.



* * *



The second match of the quarterfinals was won by Radia Schmidt from Class B. The set score was 3:1.

While Jordan Windsor excelled at enchantment itself, Radia Schmidt was able to use the divine power of Als.

That was the biggest difference.

Divine Power's emphasis on destruction was enough to make me shudder. Jordan Windsor was defeated by Radia Schmidt, who was aided by divine power.

Since there is no change in the number of people between classes A and B, it is not uncommon for class B to overtake class A in senior year.

Still, it's kind of weird to see it with my own eyes.

I could see a defeated Jordan Windsor gritting his teeth.

Whatever their usual relationship, in the end, they had lost by a decisive margin, something they had practiced with all their might throughout their temple life.

Accepting defeat is hard for anyone.

I didn't really empathize with either of them. If anyone deserved it, it was Olivia today.

Of course, unlike me, the audience seemed to be satisfied with the spectacle, since there was nothing to take in in the first place.

But this one, can Olivia win?

Olivia can't use her divine powers, and Radia Schmidt is at full strength.

What is the relationship between Radia Schmidt and Olivia?

If Radia Schmidt had been jealous of Olivia her entire time at Temple, she would have wanted to defeat her with all her might.

With a little time to spare, the finals were just around the corner.

After all, it's a match between classmates.

Olivia Ranze, who was A-1.

And then B-3, Radia Schmidt.

The finals spectacle was a little different than I expected.

Olivia's usually easygoing smile had hardened, and Radia Schmidt was smiling.

-Olivia.

-......Yes.

The vibe between the two of them was cheesy.

When talking to Jordan Windsor before the game, Radia Schmidt's usual eyes and smile seemed a little different.

Radia Schmidt.

There was something in her eyes, something akin to madness.

-The divinity I sense in you is stronger than before.

-.......

-Return to the arms of God, Olivia, you were born to do so, you were made to do so, you were made to live outside of the arms of God.

-Ladia, I'm.......

-Come back. Olivia.

It wasn't the jealousy or inferiority complex I expected.

Radia Schmidt had completely different feelings for Olivia.

-Told you, I gave up on the whole thing. I kept saying....... I kept saying.......

-No, Olivia, your divine power, your talent, your character, all of it. You are the only one who can truly unite the Five Great Houses. You are the only one who can bring this long history of faith to a close and move it into the next era.

Radia Schmidt smiles and turns to Olivia.

Olivia covers the divine power of Tuan, and Radia Schmidt covers the divine power of Als.

Even the same five major gods are different faiths.

Still, Radia Schmidt was trying to bring Olivia back to the faith. Olivia's embarrassment was palpable.

-Come back, Olivia.

-Sorry, Radia, I'm not going back.

I realized that I didn't know the specifics of what life in Olia's temple was like.

Just as Olivia's talent was something Leverier Lancet didn't want to miss.

A lot of people cared about Olivia, not the least of which were her classmates, who had a soft spot for her.

You've heard stories like this ever since you gave up your faith. You've heard it from people in the religious community, and you've heard it from many of your former classmates.

Those who had gotten along so well when she was a believer would have done anything to convince her to change her mind once she renounced her faith.

Olivia is tired of it.

In the end, contrary to my expectations, Radia Schmidt was not jealous of Olivia Ranze, but rather one of her most ardent followers.

"What are you talking about?"

As I and Saviolin Tana focused on the two in the distance, Charlotte asked Saviolin Tana.

"...... is trying to convince Olivia to return to her faith."

"ah......."

Charlotte sighed.

"You must be tired, too."

"......."

Olivia's exhaustion bordered on despair.

You know you're going to have to deal with this for the rest of your life.

There was more to Olivia than I realized.

-I have only one answer, Radia, and that is that I have no intention of returning to the arms of God.

Radia closed her eyes for a moment at Olivia's words.

-I see....... Then brace yourself.

-......will?

-Yes. Determination.

Once again, Radia Schmidt slammed her sword into the arena floor.

-A willingness to endure sad things.

-Kagak!

Radia Schmidt didn't seem evil. I was just being unnecessarily nervous. She had a kind smile on her face when she spoke to me briefly.

But Radia Schmidt, the woman Olivia was talking to, was a strange person.

The smile is gone from Radia Schmidt's face, and it's clear she's not feeling the same way she did in the semifinals.

Madness and obsession.

-Everything that is going to happen from now on is the will of God to put you on the right path.

-Whoosh!

Divine power surged from the arena floor and enveloped Radia Schmidt.





第 315页





Increased holy power and magic.

Even if Radia Schmidt wins against Olivia, there's no reason for Olivia to regain her faith by saying, "I'm nothing without divine power.

-curl!

Olivia energizes, and the finals of the Unlimited Tournament begin.

"I feel....... kind of."

"I see."

As me and Saviolin Tana listened in on their conversation, we couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding.

Radia Schmidt is trying to do something.

-Quack!

Contrary to my ominous premonition, I couldn't quite tell who had the upper hand.

Let's be clear, Radia Schmidt is also an incredible talent.

However, Olivia Ranze, who faces it with only a magic boost, is no match for it. That said, if you add Divine Power to the mix, Olivia's advantage becomes overwhelming.

No matter how offense-oriented Als' power is, Tuan's power has the power to reinforce it. If Olivia can use that, it should be easy for her to take the win over Radia Schmidt.

What the hell is Radia Schmidt going to do, force Olivia to use her divine powers when she realizes she's lost?

Olivia said that if that happened, she would be taken to the Inquisition.

So even in the face of losing a set to Herriot, I didn't use divine power.

"Just for ......'s sake, what happens when Olivia Senior uses her divine powers when she has officially renounced her faith?"

I asked because I had heard of it, but didn't really know it.

"You're not going to get a good look at ......."

Charlotte said in a negative tone.

"...... Those who use unauthorized divine power are treated as witches."

Saviolin Tana replied.

Priest or Paladin.

Whether you're ordained or not, you have a license to practice divine power. With the exception of this class of students, who are more like apprentices.

To monopolize divine power.

Olivia wasn't secretly healing people in a village in the middle of nowhere; she was called the Saint of Eredian.

If you give up faith, divine powers must disappear. The power comes from the belief in God.

But Olivia's divine powers didn't fade, they only grew stronger.

However, it must not be used. Divine power unused in the arms of a god is considered heresy.

"If that were to happen, Olivia wouldn't be considered a witch. But she would be put on trial."

If Olivia were to use holy power, she would be using unauthorized holy power in public. As such, there is a good chance that she could be framed under the guise of an Inquisition or Inquisition.

Radia Schmidt will try to force Olivia to use her divine powers.

But how?

Olivia didn't even use her holy power in the moment of her defeat by Herriot.

At the tournament, Olivia fights like it's a strength she doesn't have.

If you lose, you lose, and you're not going to be forced to use divine power.

-Bang! Quack!

A blow from Radia Schmidt sends a dull thud across the arena, and Olivia takes it with a single sword.

Not only was Olivia deflecting the destructive holy power with the power of her magical enhancements, but she was also counterattacking.

I don't know about anything else, but is that really a human fight?

I was like, "Oh, yeah.

"Great, both of you."

The world's greatest monster was standing next to me praising it.

It was an uphill battle.

Radia Schmidt fights with everything she's got.

Olivia Ranze only uses magic enhancements.

If it weren't for Olivia, Radia Schmidt would be in her place.

Radia was good enough to think that. But she wasn't jealous of Olivia, she was trying to put Olivia back where she belonged.

Obsession, not jealousy.

In the end, both are exhausting.

-Kurung!

A white glow emanated from the sword as Radia's divine power converged, and it slammed into the ground.

-Kookaburra!

I wondered if that was holy power. Divine power focused on destruction was more powerful than magic.

After Herriot, I could almost see the stadium, which had been reinforced even further, being ripped apart in real time.

That's a paladin.

In fact, I'm beginning to wonder if berserker might be a better word.

But Olivia's dealing with it was just as crazy.

He'd parry or dodge dangerously powerful attacks, and he'd poke out attacks just in time to keep Radia on her toes.

In terms of overall output, Radia is ahead.

Olivia, however, was a bit more sophisticated and pressured Radia with her predictable attacks and counters.

As such, the outcome of the match was somewhat predictable.

Radia is doing well, but Olivia will win.

I'm not belittling my opponent like I did with Herriot.

Olivia may not be using her divine powers, but she's still keeping her guard up.

Radia Schmidt has a trick up her sleeve.

If you're trying to force Olivia to use her holy power, how does that work?

Olivia attacked Radia with sharp, precise strikes.

-Bang! Quack! bang!

Olivia's onslaught didn't give Radia a chance to catch her breath.

Concatenation on concatenation.

Steadily attacking the divine and enchanted defenses, Olivia finally succeeded in creating a gap.

That's it.

Sensing her victory, Olivia plunged her sword into Radia Schmidt's chest.

Olivia takes the first set.

-Kurung!

I could see an explosion of red energy emanating from Radia Schmidt's body.

"That's......!"

Savior Tana was watching the scene wide-eyed, and Olivia took a big step back in embarrassment.

-Ladia! What are you doing!

-Olivia....... You have to win, right......? You need the money, so....... You're in a tournament, aren't you, kids, and you need to help?

Enveloped in a reddish aura, Radia smiles an eerie smile.

-Beat me with all your might. With all your might.

Radia Schmidt, bathed in an ominous red glow, was anything but normal. Saviolin Tana mumbled something incoherent, as if she knew what that red energy was.

"You're Berserk ....... Why, you're just a student, and you've got that kind of power......."

"What is that?"

"A power rarely used by the higher priests of Alth."

Berserk.

I don't know the details, but the word itself already gives it away. Olivia exclaimed, her face turning white.

-Ladia! Stop it, now!

"That's....... is the power of burning lives."

This is an extreme method used by the Paladins of Alth, who burn their lives to increase their power.

The Paladins of Alth were not berserkers, they were berserkers.

Radia Schmidt was using that power right now in the tournament final.

Radia knows why Olivia needs to win. She knows she's not in it for herself, she's in it for the prize money.

So she was doing this crazy thing where she was burning her own life to boost her power so that Olivia couldn't take her down unless she was at full strength.

You're doing all this to get Olivia to use her divine powers?

-Bang! Ka-kang! kang!

Radia Schmidt was in the middle of pushing Olivia backwards when she was overcome by a red aura.

Charlotte looks at Savior Tana with an uneasy expression.

"Shouldn't we stop it?"

"Yes, but Berserk is a very rare power among the priests of Alth. Even within the Order of Alth itself, there are very few who know how to use it. Olivia seems to know, but....... I wonder if the organizers know what's going on over there now......."

To the untrained eye, it would appear that Radia Schmidt, on the verge of defeat, has suddenly found her strength, unaware that the red energy is a life-burning force.

I glance over to the Crusader Knightmaster, Elayon Bolton, and see that he, too, is in turmoil.

Elayon Bolton was staring at the field with a grave expression on his face, and even the paladins with him were talking amongst themselves in bewilderment.

Even the most senior paladins with the Crusader Master have no idea what Radia Schmidt is doing right now.

Olivia gritted her teeth and fought off the onslaught of Radia Schmidt, who was unleashing a barrage of attacks.

The match should be stopped immediately.

However, if the organizers are unaware of the situation, the game will continue as is.

Olivia is being outclassed by Radia Schmidt, who is drawing on extreme strength. It would be best to defeat her once and for all, but that would require the use of divine power.

That's not an option to consider.

It is possible to hold out without using holy power, but Radia Schmidt, who has run out of life to draw from, will die on the spot.

That's why there's only one way to stop Radia Schmidt from burning lives.

Stop the match.

Or.

Olivia gives up the game.

It was just the two of them.

"Lord Tana, stop the game immediately, or I'll take the blame."

"Yes, Your Highness."

Charlotte said that with a serious look on her face, and Saviolin Tana nodded.

-Abstain.......

A puzzled Olivia abstained.



* * *



Olivia was shivering in the athlete's waiting room, her hands clasped over her face.

Abstained.

"When I grow up, I want to be just like you!

"Hehe, your dreams are too small, you should try to be something much bigger than your sister.

"You're the prettiest, nicest, most amazing person I know.

"Dude, don't make it too high.

Abstained.

"Ms. Olivia, thank you as always.

"Whatever, it's what I have to do.

'But now that I'm in a position to do it, I'm not going to....... I hope you don't overdo it.'

'Abbot, I'm still good, because I think I'm going to win a lot of money at this year's Temple Festival.

"Prizes?

'Yes, the tournament and its....... and the other tournament....... Hmm. There is such a thing. Anyway!'

I abstained.

It was inevitable.

There is no such thing as a second place prize in a Temple tournament.

Most of the audience was stunned.

It was such a disappointing end to a highly anticipated final.

Very few people knew the details. Whether Radia Schmidt's behavior was disqualifying or not is up for debate.

So, for now, I had to wrap up the contest, albeit with a lukewarm reception.

Olivia didn't even think to watch the awards ceremony.

Although the prize is a prize.

She was disappointed that she didn't win, but more than that, Olivia's head felt like it was going to explode.

It was driving me crazy.

I can't figure out why I'm doing this to myself.

I don't know how long I've been sitting there in a daze.

"Olivia."

Radia Schmidt was walking toward Olivia.

-Turp!

She tossed away the gaudy trophy that was proof of her unlimited tournament wins, as if she didn't care about any of that.

Radia approached Olivia.

"Why did you abstain?"

"......."

"Money, you needed it."

Radia Schmidt's face didn't show the slightest hint of joy at her victory.

The only thing he wanted in exchange for the option of burning his life was to use his holy power in public.

When he was taken to the Inquisition, Radia Schmidt risked her life to force him to become a priest again. She risked her life because she knew she had to.

Divine Power could have taken out Radia Schmidt with Berserk.

But that's not what Olivia did.

If it stays that way, Radia Schmidt will be dead.

Olivia was forced to make a choice.

I was faced with a choice between feeding and clothing children who would otherwise go hungry because we had no budget, or forcing myself to live a religious life.

She was forced to choose, and she chose.

"This is not the Olivia I know."

Radia wasn't happy about the win at all. Rather, she glared angrily at Olivia.

"The Olivia I know, in that situation, would have taken me out in a heartbeat, won the prize, and helped people. Obviously, that's what she should have done."

In Radia Schmidt's mind, Olivia is not the kind of person who would abstain in such a situation. She was competing to help someone with her prize money, and in that situation, she should have used her divine power and not thought about herself.

The person everyone expects you to be.

Radia Schmidt was upset that they didn't.

Olivia was blue in the face and shaking.

"Yeah, I'm selfish. I'm going to be selfish now. I'm going to be selfish. I'm going to be that way. This is who I am. This is who I am now....... So. leave me, leave me alone."

"No, Olivia, no, you can't do this. You should have just used your holy power."

Radia Schmidt shakes her head emphatically.

He kneels down in front of Olivia and stares up at her, terrified.

Eyes as black as the abyss stared at Olivia.

"Olivia, you can be the right person again. Look at me, I risked my life, I didn't think about myself, I did this to help you. I wasn't always like this. Olivia, I've always admired the way you help people, and I'm trying to be that person. That's why I did this. So, Olivia, let me help you this time. Olivia, you're only making it harder on yourself. You're gonna have a harder time. No, it's already horribly harsh on you, this situation where you're falling further and further away from God. I didn't do this for nothing. This was the only way. This was the only way that no one would get hurt."

Olivia could barely hear Radia Schmidt, who was talking so fast.

I didn't even want to hear it in the first place.

Radia Schmidt thinks the object of her admiration is being destroyed.

That's why he thinks it's time for him to help Olivia.

"I, I never asked you to do that....... Please......."

"No. No, Olivia, I'm giving you my winnings. I don't want you to be a bad person. You can help the children, but promise me one thing. You'll come back to God. It's not too late. It's not too late."

No matter what you say to someone whose ears are closed, they won't hear you. Olivia squeezed her eyes shut, afraid to look into Radia Schmidt's eyes any longer.

Eventually, Olivia burst into tears.

"Please, don't do this to me....... Please....... Please leave me alone....... Please. Why me. Why does it have to be me....... Please....... Just leave me alone....... I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong......."

"No!"

Radia blurted out, as if she couldn't get over that.

"Olivia, you can't say that! You were chosen by the gods! A perfect person like you, born with the favor of all the five great gods, can't deny them! Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's right. It's called wandering. Oh, the gods are giving you these trials to make you more perfect. Oh, it's all part of their will to bring you to greater glory. So, take your time. Maybe start by going back to the temple. No, let's start slow by talking to people about grace........"

"That's a lot of fucking words."

Suddenly, a voice from the hallway made Radia and the crying Olivia turn their heads toward it.

"Why do you keep preaching to the choir when you don't like it, even street preachers don't stick around this long?"

It wasn't anyone else, but Reinhardt, who approached with rough steps. Reinhard lunged forward, grabbed Olivia's sobbing hand, and pulled her to her feet.

"I'd just smack you in the face if you were talking shit, but you're listening to all that bullshit?"

"......."

"It's none of your business, Reinhardt."

Radia Schmidt said to Reinhardt with a stern look.

"What the hell?"

Reinhardt pulled a shivering Olivia into his arms and tucked her behind me.

"It's not your place to be between us."

"......what?"

"Go fuck yourself."

Reinhardt grabbed Olivia's hand and started dragging her along.

"Uh, where are you going, I can't let go of Olivia, you can't do this!"

At Radia's cry, Reinhardt turned his icy gaze on Radia Schmidt.

"Leave me alone. Don't be an ass."

"......."

Olivia's head was bowed, and Reinhardt's hand pulled her away. Radia watched in disbelief as Olivia was dragged away.

Reinhardt.

That name is a thorn in the neck.

Olivia is glazed and gentle, but she's been stubborn since day one.

But I'm being very generous with him.

The Saint of Tuan, who is supposed to be chaste, acts as if she is in love with him.

No, it all started when Olivia became friends with a guy named Reinhardt.

He's the cause of all this.

We just need him to go away.

Everyone's focusing on the weird side.

You said he's not to be touched.

You're trying to sacrifice another poor child.

'Maggots, scum. The devil.'

In Radia Schmidt's eyes, Reinhardt was the one who corrupted Olivia, who was on the right path.

He shouldn't be there.

Only when he's gone will Olivia be able to get back on track.

You can get back on the right track.

Radia gritted her teeth and stared down the hallway where Olivia had disappeared.

'Yeah....... It's you.......'

I would do anything for Olivia.

'I'd rather have you dead than Adriana or that child, and Olivia will be fine without you....... She'll be fine without you....... Why, a child in the arms of God should be sacrificed for something like you....... No. It only takes one unbeliever like you.'

Radia Schmidt's eyes widened.





316





The leader of the Crusader Knights, Elayon Bolton, exited the stadium with his entourage.

"I thought you could make them use divine power, but that's all you did."

"......I guess they thought Olivia wouldn't abstain."

The paladin in training said briefly.

Radia Schmidt.

She may not be Olivia Ranze, but she's a powerful paladin with a promising future. As it is, she's more than ready for action, she's overflowing.

I didn't take her word for it.

Olivia said there was something I could do to help her regain her faith, and I just wanted it to be something.

Rather than watch her friend die in front of her, or use her divine powers to win, Olivia's resolve to abstain was evident.

Why did I think that would work?

No, it's not that I thought it would work, it's just that I felt like I had no choice but to try it.

As it turns out, Radia Schmidt was more extreme than Elion Bolton realized.

Regardless of your orientation, extremism is dangerous, and Elion Bolton knew it.

Elion Bolton could see the maddening obsession with Olivia in Radia Schmidt's eyes.

"I don't think Radia Schmidt is going to give up......."

"......I think so too."

It was clear that Radia Schmidt was going to do one more thing, and it wasn't going to be pretty. The attendant whispered discreetly in the Crusader's ear.

"By the way, what do you think is the likelihood that Radia Schmidt is connected to the unnamed order?"

"It's good fodder for extremists, but you don't want that level of extremism......."

They have an unintelligible conversation and walk away from the stadium.

If Olivia was using divine power, she had a job to do as the leader of the Crusaders, but that didn't happen.

As such, the Crusaders now had no business in the Temple.



* * *



"...... I know it's not good, but how about this?"

"......No. Thanks."

I was hoping to find a secluded spot, but given the circumstances, there were none, so we ended up in a cafe with fewer people and I sat across from Olivia.

I felt like I was losing my mind, and losing it badly.

Charlotte and Saviolin Tana knew I was going to check on Olivia, so they told me to be nice to her.

If I waited any longer, Charlotte would have stopped playing, so I just had to be patient.

But Olivia couldn't possibly know that. If she continued to fight, Radia Schmidt would die at full health, and if she used her holy power, the Inquisition would be waiting.

So Olivia had no choice but to abstain.

The look on Radia Schmidt's face was horrifying.

He hadn't expected Olivia to abstain, and he looked stunned.

Apparently, he believed that Olivia would use her divine powers to subdue him.

In the end, the prize went to Radia Schmidt. Although she didn't seem to place any value on winning.

Olivia was sullen, her head hanging low, not even touching the car.

"Does this happen a lot?"

"......Yes."

"It's not just him....... Other people too?"

"Although there are differences in degree......."

Olivia seemed sad that I had learned of the many problems she had since leaving her faith.

Whether she was flirting with me or arguing with Ellen, Olivia always seemed to be in good spirits, even if she was a bit of a bitch.

Olivia wasn't getting along with her friends.

It wasn't just that he wanted to see me. It wasn't just because she wanted to see me.

I was running away from them.

Still, if others are persistently urged to return to their faith, Radia Schmidt's case seemed to be a bit extreme.

It was insanity.

I'm sure Olivia was just as shocked as I was because she never imagined she'd be experiencing this today.

What to say to comfort them.

What would be good for Olivia right now.

I've never been a believer, and I've never had to deal with the problems that come with giving it up, so I had no idea what Olivia was feeling.

He was expected by the whole world.

I abandoned it by my own choice, and people believe it was wrong.

I don't feel like I'm living the wrong life, but everyone around me is telling me I'm wrong.

It was like seeing a different side of Olivia, who was always cheerful and smiling.

You can't see his expression because his head is down.

It's just that she's had enough of the people around her. Just because Olivia can be angry and argumentative with Ellen doesn't mean she can be with anyone else. What is possible for one person to say and do, may not be possible for another.

So Olivia smiled vaguely, embarrassedly, and pushed away, rejecting the urgings of those around her, chipping away.

"I'm not sure......."

"......."

"Why are you doing this to me. I, I really don't know."

I've lived with so many expectations, and even though I've gotten away from my parents, who were the biggest ones, I still feel that pressure around me.

"I don't think I'm that great, but......."

He couldn't understand why people would be so obsessed with him.

When you think about it, there had to be a reason for the obsession, even if it wasn't Radia Schmidt.

If you think about it, Olivia is also the owner of Tiamata, even though they are co-owned.

Knowing that would have made it harder, not easier.

In the end, Olivia entered the tournament for the prize money, but didn't win because of Radia Schmidt.

"Actually, I wonder if it was different before."

Olivia, her head down, smiles wryly.

"I am what people want me to be. No one....... No one. If I'm not what they want or expect me to be, they're disappointed in me. They wonder if the daughter of a crusader knight is supposed to be like this, if this is how it's supposed to be. I was a doll that existed to fulfill other people's expectations."

That's probably how Olivia's life was.

Too much life, too many things required, too many things forbidden, too many things expected.

You've lived a life where even the slightest attempt at freedom is seen as an indulgence and a depravity.

"Finally, I know what my life is. I'm trying to live a life where it's okay to wonder about those things, where it's okay to want those things, and people still want something from me. They think I've gone astray, that I need to get back on the right track. They think I've helped others in the past, and now that I'm on the wrong path, I need to be helped. I don't think so. I don't think I'm wrong. People are trying to give me help I don't want, and people....... People around me, they don't even realize that it's not help at all."

They have a different worldview than those who believe that living in the arms of God is an absolute good. So, in some ways, we can't talk to them at all.

This is absolutely right. So it's good for you in the end. So everything I say is basically good.

You can't have a conversation with someone who starts with the absolute proposition that I'm right and you're wrong. The only people who can have a conversation with them are those who share the same worldview.

Olivia has gotten away from it, but for whatever reason, people try to force her to come back because they think you'll be happy if she does.

At the other extreme would be someone like Radia Schmidt.

Olivia isn't in this state simply because she's disappointed that she missed out on the prize money or because she's traumatized by what happened today.

I know this isn't the end of the story, which is why I'm struggling so much.

It's even harder when you don't know what's going to happen next.

I want to do something.

But I can't expel all of Olivia's classmates, and I can't go to each one of them and threaten them with two heads if they talk shit about her.

"Reinhardt."

"Yes."

Normally, I'm a bit of a prick, but now I've softened my demeanor.

I feel like if I stiffen up now, it will hurt more.

Olivia lifts her head and looks at me, struggling.

His eyes were red.

I felt like I was about to cry.

"I know it's bad form to say this at a time like this, but......."

"What is it. Tell me."

"Can I give you a hug?"

"......."

She looked like she was about to cry.

It was the look of someone who thinks they have no one on their side, wishing they had one.

Not because of any other emotion.

He seemed to be purely looking for comfort.

"No, no need. I'm sorry. Really. Bad. Me......."

When I seemed to hesitate, Olivia's lips quivered and she forced a smile.

"Okay."

Eventually, I made my way over to Olivia's side and gently put my arm around her shoulders.

Olivia buried her face in my shoulder.

Her shoulders heave. Little by little, slowly, like she's taking her first breath after birth.

Olivia cried, very quietly.

"Thanks....... Reinhardt."

I felt pathetic as I tried to figure out what to say to comfort him.

I realized that comfort is more than just words. I was reminded.



* * *



Olivia cried for a long time and then ran out of the cafe.

"...... sold."

He was embarrassed that he was sobbing in front of everyone.

"Don't you think a puffy eye is embarrassing enough as it is?"

"Gee, really?!"

Olivia's complexion turned pensive at my words and she scratched her face. I don't have a mirror, so what's the point?

"Oh my God, I have to go to Miss Temple today, and I don't want my eyes to glaze over!"

"Don't worry, it doesn't look that way."

"But it's the subtleties that make the difference! I can't even win the tournament, so Miss Temple has to win the real thing! What are you gonna do, Reinhardt? If I don't win, I'm not gonna be able to......."

Olivia sobbed again, and then held it in, thinking that if she cried more, her eyes might swell even more.

I'm feeling better. I think I can feel things getting back to normal.

In the end, what's done is done.

The tournament was over, and Olivia now had her sights set on Miss Temple.

Now I don't know who I want to be Miss Temple. Olivia rubs her face, muttering in a desperate voice that the mention of her puffy eyes has bothered her so much.

"Hah....... I don't even have a dress and I'm going out looking like this......."

"Why don't you have a dress? You know, the one from the last fundraiser."

Olivia laughed in embarrassment at my comment.

"That's because....... I actually sold it to......."

"......."

I didn't have to ask why she'd sold it. Olivia was breaking out in a cold sweat, as if she thought I was going to come clean.

I don't even know what to say about this, that he was selling his property to help others.

"Can't I borrow that....... Can't I borrow it?"

"It's a lot of money to rent ......."

You'll probably look like you're going out in your school uniform, and you'll probably look like you didn't prepare and just went with your face, which is the perfect way to look like an asshole.

I think of Olivia standing in her school uniform, alone and without makeup, in a crowd of people dressed to the nines.

I don't know what that would actually look like, but somehow I knew it would be miserable.

I don't know if I would have won an unlimited tournament, but I did lose a forfeit in the final.

Dress.

Dresses.......

"......."

"...... Are you angry?"

"......No. Not that."

Dress.

No. No.

But I think we have similar body types, I'm taller, but I've been downsizing a bit since then.

I didn't want to throw it away, so I gave it to Elise to sell back.......

You probably haven't sold it yet.......

No, but it's possible that there's someone out there who does remember.

But it's like, "Well, there's got to be some sort of design," so what happens?

This is really dangerous.......

Wouldn't it be better to just give her money to buy a dress?

But honestly, it's not a dollar, and I don't have a lot of time, so I might as well just wear it instead of going to a boutique and trying to find the right size and design.

I realize there's no reason to do this.

Right now, Olivia was looking so much worse for wear.

I feel so bad for you and wish I could do something about it.

"Go to ...... and wait for me in the dorm."

"Huh?"

"Go ahead and wait anyway."

"Oh, okay......."

If you ask me where I got my dress, I have nothing to tell you.

Yeah, well, if you get caught doing that!

My sister looks like this.

I'll sell you some of that shit!

I have a lot to apologize for this time!

What are you going to do if you find out? Are you going to kill me?

I left the temple, leaving Olivia, who didn't speak English and was bewildered at being told to wait.



* * *



"He lost in the final of a tournament."

"...... fell off?"

"Yeah, I don't know why, but he abstained?"

Ellen, who was getting ready for the Miss Temple contest, shook her head at Riana's comment.

Ellen's mouth dropped open slightly at the unexpected revelation that Olivia had vaguely thought she was going to win.

While the details of the situation are unknown, the audience seemed quite upset that the tournament final ended in such an unconvincing manner.

Abstain.

Someone who looked like a sure winner withdrew.

She had a vague idea that it was for some reason, but Ellen wondered what that reason was.

Reinhardt would have gone to the finals, but do you know why?

"Oh, there he is. Him."

Riana pointed out the window, and Ellen could see Olivia looking out the first floor window.

Olivia was alone.

Ellen finds herself somehow relieved by this fact.

Olivia didn't look happy, even if she tried to pretend. We don't know what caused her to abstain, but her eyes were wide open.

"Are you crying......?

I cried.

And he came back alone.

I thought Reinhardt might be next to me, but he wasn't.

"Look right here."

"Ah....... Yeah."

Riana turned Ellen's head and started touching her.

We don't know what happened to the tournament, but he'll be in Miss Temple soon enough.

We're not even going after Miss Temple.

Ellen made up her mind.

I'm going to put on a good show today. I practiced smiling in the mirror a lot. It didn't work, but I kept trying.

I'm going to stand in front of Reinhardt with a different look.

After the contest, regardless of the outcome, let's spend a little time together. We were too busy to spend time with each other during the festivities, and I'm sure Reinhardt would make time for you today.

Ellen doesn't know what Reinhardt's facial expression will be, and she doesn't know what she should be doing.

For today, Ellen decided to forget about everything else and just think about her heart.

Not Harriet, not Olivia, not anyone else.

For today, I decided not to think about anyone but Reinhardt.
