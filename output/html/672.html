            Episode 672.





Only a few were able to see specifically what was happening in the heart of the battlefield.

One of those close to the heart of it was Ludwig.

Slashing, slashing, slashing at monsters in the rain.

As he made his way across the battlefield, building a mountain out of the monster's carcasses, Ludwig saw the battle unfold.

A dragon that seems to have the universe in its body.

After witnessing the dragon's destruction of the Titans at close range, Ludwig despaired, as did everyone else.

But before the creature could wipe the Alliance off the face of the earth with its overwhelming destruction, I saw Ellen defeat it once and for all.

And soon, I saw the battle of the demons and heroes begin.

It was a series of incomprehensible situations.

It's commonplace for people to see demons and warriors fighting, but for Ludwig, it shouldn't have happened.

The two fight.

Ludwig had seen it from afar, but he had a hard enough time taking down the monsters that were flooding in from all directions.

A battle of demons and heroes.

But even more unacceptable was what happened next.

Immortals suddenly began killing monsters and Allied soldiers indiscriminately.

The screams and resentful cries from across the battlefield spoke for themselves.

Ludwig knows what that means.

Christina, who is supposed to be in control of the Immortals, has gone insane, or is dead.

Ludwig doesn't know what's going on.

The important thing is that the nasty monster appeared and disappeared.

With all the warp gates destroyed, all that's left to do is kill the remaining monsters, and the last enemy of humanity is the Immortals.

Immortal has left the battlefield.

And when he went back in, everyone saw him trying to kill a demon fighting for humanity.

Ludwig saw it too.

The demon lured the Immortals and made a mess of Diane.

I've seen him fight for humanity more desperately than anyone else, in more dangerous places than anyone else.

He went out on a limb for humanity, even when that humanity's weapons were trying to kill him.

Can you forgive the devil?

Should the devil pay no price?

I couldn't think about that.

The moment an Immortal starts slaughtering Allied soldiers, people will assume that the Immortal's actions were ordered by the Emperor.

It's all her fault, but people don't even know she exists.

Therefore, all blame and guilt will be pointed at the Emperor.

The empire is not at stake.

When this war ends, the empire doesn't just disappear.

The empire is already gone.

With the Immortals irresponsibly gone, and even now with the tip of their swords pointed at the Alliance, the Empire has ceased to exist.

The rest of the world may not know it, but everyone in the Alliance has already seen the demon fight for humanity.

Everyone saw how he used the threat of being hunted by the Immortals to kill the monsters.

I couldn't help but feel betrayed as I watched Scarlett appear from all corners of the battlefield to neutralize the Immortals.

There's no telling what terrible things could have happened if we hadn't had that alignment.

Scarlett's betrayal proved to be a blessing in disguise for Ludwig.

The empire is gone.

The war is over.

The world needs someone to take the next baton, and it's the devil.

But if the demon dies on the spot.

A demon who went from being the enemy of mankind to its savior in a single day.

Humanity is once again in turmoil.

It doesn't matter if they are good or evil.

Without one to hold the baton, humanity is torn apart.

If the demon dies on the spot.

To whom will the allies pledge allegiance, and how will it all work out?

It's not about whether the empire was right or the devil was right.

The problem is that the empire is divided between those who believe the empire is right and those who believe the devil is right.

If the demon dies, the rift will intensify.

Someone must ensure the safety of all, even in the name of tyranny.

The devil isn't the only one who pays the price.

Responsibility for not stopping Christina.

Failure to persuade.

So at this moment, Ludwig himself is to blame for Immortal's slaughter of the Allies.

No.

Actually, that's probably a good thing.

Ludwig watched as the monsters were sliced and diced.

The devil's desperate fight.

Somehow saving Ellen from an unknown force.

What you tried to keep, what you tried to get back.

I watched as it was finally returned.

Ludwig could not be saved.

I couldn't convince him.

But after a desperate fight that could be seen from afar, the demon succeeded in reclaiming Ellen from something unknown.

That win.

A demon who succeeded in keeping something after that desperate fight.

Reinhardt.

The triumph of a demon who has finally reached that which he could not.

I couldn't let it end in a futile death.

Already seen.

There's a price to pay.

When he said he had to take responsibility, he didn't know the first thing about Reinhardt.

As I watched him being chased by the Immortals from afar, I didn't have the slightest idea of what Reinhardt was dealing with.

We still don't know everything.

We don't know what's been going on, and we don't know what's going to happen.

Just this win.

Reinhardt's victory shouldn't be a miserable return to nothingness.

It's impossible to find the right answer, and that hasn't changed.

I don't think it's right for the world of demons to come.

But.

For the demon to die on the spot.

And the death of Ellen, whom the Devil has somehow managed to save.

That's the wrong answer.

Because it shouldn't be.

Since the path he was on was also one of the worst answers, Ludwig doesn't deserve to pay for his mistakes.

If so, then the minimum line.

So, back to the original mindset.

You have to fight for someone's life.

Not the death of something.

Not the wages of sin.

After all, you're fighting for your life.

-Kwagga River!

That's why Ludwig fights.

No one will remember, and

Even those saved will not remember.

Last fight.

"It's a bizarre power."

A strange gray light flickers in the eyes of an old wizard you don't recognize.

All I knew was that the old wizard had taken everything that had protruded from Ellen's body.

I thought he was one of Reinhardt's men, but he's trying to kill Reinhardt.

Ludwig wields a greatsword of blackness, and the old wizard blocks it with an outstretched hand.

The black magic sword that has been shredding and tearing the flesh of monsters is too easily blocked.

"That right arm, I don't think it's yours."

The old wizard points to Ludwig's right arm, which is burning with darkness.

"I'm sure I've heard of you somewhere, but......."

The old wizard shakes his head.

"Well, I don't remember, but that's not unusual for an old guy like me......."

I can't really explain it, but the old monster was unpleasant to look at.

"But it was a shame that no one got in my way at the end, so maybe that's a good thing."

The old monster loves nothingness, but he's happy enough to know that someone got in his way at the end.

So, I had no intention of killing the demon before I could defeat Ludwig.

Because that's the story.

I'm still not a fan of spoiling a story with tacky tricks.

There was one last time.

So, it's beautiful to get past each other.

"@AndreaMcGee....... 허억......."

He's blocking their way, but Ludwig has already crossed the line of fire several times.

Just as Reinhard had been pushed to the limit and passed out, Ludwig was already at his limit.

Plus, Ludwig didn't get strong in the normal way in the first place.

-Currrrr!

"Turn off...... Yuck!"

The torrent of black magic that erupted from his right arm was out of control, and the pain that coursed through his body was invading his consciousness.

We've come this far after a hard-fought battle.

So Ludwig's stamina was pretty much gone by the time he got here.

The demon had a means of recovery called Tiamata, but Ludwig has none. And Ludwig's condition is not something that can be cured by divine power.

He can't even control the power of his right arm, which has begun to run amok.

You're up against an enemy you don't even know who they are, but they're probably the most powerful you've ever faced, and the situation is the worst.

The old wizard, watching Ludwig's anguish, stretches out his right hand.

"Boy......."

-TzuzuTzuzuTzuzu

"Easy power comes at a great cost."

His hand, lowered to the waterlogged earth, swings lightly toward Ludwig.

Despite being separated by more than two dozen meters, Ludwig saw a rift in space.

The atmosphere compresses, creating a blade of wind that swings toward Ludwig.

"......!"

-Kwaggagang!

"Boom!"

The wizard, who had sent Ludwig flying with a single flick of his hand, was already in front of Ludwig's nose the next moment with a short space leap.

-Ohhhhh!

In the mage's right hand, a strange storm of gray light, not mana, raged.

-Crunch!

A torrent of souls washed over Ludwig.

"Off......hhhhhhhhhh!"

The pain is not physical, but spiritual.

It was an unfamiliar pain that made even Ludwig, who had gotten used to pain during the Chimera procedure, scream.

Swallowed by the torrent, Ludwig rolled across the floor, shivering, unable to get to his feet.

We don't know what it is, but the devil definitely fought something like this.

So Ludwig couldn't help but realize that the pain the demon felt was now being felt by him.

Beyond the pain, the terror of the core rises.

Not on the level of aches and pains, but a soul-sickening sensation.

Despair fills my head.

I can't.

How can something like me.

This is not my place.

Such.

Thoughts fill my mind.

The fallen demon over there.

Was Reinhardt fighting something like this?

How the hell does a demon fight something like that.

What's even weirder is the monster in front of you.

With something like that in your body, why are you having so much fun?

An unfamiliar pain for the first time in your life.

And the horror.

A sinking feeling of despair.

The monster approaches Ludwig, who is shivering all over, and smiles a sickening smile.

"Isn't it more beautiful because you can't kill someone?"

"Hmph......."

"This old man likes the look on the face of a man with a broken heart."

Gritting his teeth, he tries not to back down, but the pain he's just felt has him stumbling backwards.

-Chulbuck

Trembling with fear, Ludwig stumbled backward, and soon fell flat on his ass in a puddle of water.

"ugh....... ugh......."

"You didn't get to see the despair of someone you really wanted to see, so why don't you show it to them instead?"

Unable to make facial expressions while stunned.

How I despair.

There's no telling how much pain they're in.

When you really take it all away from the one who gave you the chance to take it all away at the end. I want to see the look on his face, but I can't see it now.

So, the monster will get that look from the nameless person who showed up to defend him.

Fear grips Ludwig's entire body.

First-time pain.

Unheard of.

Something that truly deserves to be called a monster is coming to bring pain and terror, not death.

Nevertheless, we can't back down.

Squeeze a force that won't let go.

While somehow supporting a wobbly leg.

Happens.

"Ugh!"

Biting your lip until it bleeds, offsetting the pain of your soul with the pain of your body.

Taking a step forward, Ludwig swings his dark greatsword.

-Bang!

Your greatsword is blocked by the force field the monster has created.

If once doesn't work, twice.

-Bang!

If that doesn't work, three times.

-Bam!

The force field shattered, but in that moment, the monster was already preparing for the next one.

What the heck is in front of you.

Why it has this power.

Or maybe I'm just too weak.

The old wizard waves his hand.

"How about this."

-deaddeaddead!

"......!"

The earth trembles and boulders begin to cling to Ludwig's body.

"This is ......!"

Then, squeeze yourself like you're going to break.

-Currrrrr!

Torn pieces of the earth wrap around Ludwig's body, compressing him to no end.

Soon, the rocks become increasingly transparent and turn into crystals.

In a prison of crystals, Ludwig was trapped, wide-eyed.

A normal human being would crumble under the pressure.

However, Ludwig is by no means an ordinary man.

I may not have the name and fame to back it up.

It doesn't fall into the mold of mediocrity.

-Tweet......!

The crystal prison that holds Ludwig is cracking, and it's about to explode.

-Ka-ka-kang!

The crystal shatters, and Ludwig, trapped in it, falls to the ground, gasping for air.

-shootaaaaa

Sagging like a wet rag in the rain, it was already a loser in its own right.

"hao......."

But as if admiring its own escape, the creature stares at Ludwig, who remains collapsed, breathing heavily, trying to get to his feet.

Once again, the dark greatsword is in Ludwig's hand.

The fight continues.

Ludwig is clearly strong.

The Greatsword of Darkness is already a powerful magical weapon in its own right, and it's intimidating enough for an old wizard, and it's capable of destroying defensive forcefields.

It was a monstrous force.

However, the other person is too much of a stranger.

The old monster, with its strange powers, was too alien a foe for Ludwig to deal with.

Magic for traveling through space.

And the torrent of souls was something that Ludwig could do nothing to stop, nothing to avoid.

Monsters don't have to deal with themselves.

Ludwig knew he was just playing.

The flying earth spears, explosions, and thunderbolts can be dodged and crushed, but the torrent of spirits wielded by the old wizard is unstoppable, and the mere touch of it floods your mind with such terror and agony that your mind threatens to collapse.

"Turn off......eh!"

Antony watched with amusement as Ludwig writhed in agony.

It's the kind of power the old monster wishes he had.

A power that doesn't kill, but can cripple.

The power to twist anyone's expression into despair, fear, and pain.

He never coveted it until the devil offered it to him, but once he had it in his hands, it was a power he hadn't realized he wanted.

Antirrhinus was the only one in the world who enjoyed using this power.

Don't let the enemy get in your way.

His limbs are shaking, and his eyes are filled with terror from the pain.

Antony doesn't know who is in front of him.

But just by being here, you're not an ordinary human being, and you don't have an ordinary will.

So, the monster is curious.

How far this power can take a human being.

"Show me. Boy."

-Currrrr!

A torrent of souls from Antrianus' grasp engulfs Ludwig.

"Off!"

Ludwig sits up and begins to shake and scream.

"I wonder what the look on the face of someone who's broken and bent and doesn't even have the will to get up anymore....... I wonder."

It won't kill you, but it will break you to the limit.

Antirrhinus intended to test the limits of its power.

It's a great toy to see what you can do.

It's good entertainment until the real toys wake up.

-Currrrrrr!

"Aaahhhhhhhh!"

As if to remove the legs of an ant before stomping it to death, Antirrhinus looks down at Ludwig, who is having a seizure.

And watch.

Happen.

Do you have the energy to get up, the mental strength to get up.

After the storm passes, Antrianus sees Ludwig on his knees, his legs shaking as he rises to his feet.

His right hand still held the dark greatsword.

"It's happening."

"Ugh......ugh......."

Ludwig already knows that his opponent is playing with him.

I know I can't win.

I'd rather stall for time.

If the stunned demon wakes up, things might change.

I can't.

Reinhardt might be able to.

I always failed, but.

Because Reinhardt always succeeded.

Hold on.

Until Reinhardt gets up.

Not to be a devil's advocate, but.

There must be someone who can find new answers.

And that's not me.

Because he's the devil.

Like Christina.

Killing and destroying things out of spite alone is wrong.

Eventually everyone dies.

Despite your intentions, someone is sacrificed.

If it happens eventually, no matter who's in front of you.

If any of them end up costing you.

If no one has the right answer.

At least one without malice.

I saw no malice in him.

Reinhardt.

It must be honored.

Running, fleeing, fighting.

I've seen the desperation in his eyes as he fights to keep even that in the face of all the evil directed at him.

You have to hold on.

Until Reinhardt gets up.

The monster in front of you also knows that you're interested in it.

You don't know what kind of monster it is, or what the hell you're suffering from.

Just don't fall down.

If all you have to do is get up.

If it can change things even a little bit, it should happen.

Antony smiles when he sees that Ludwig's eyes are still alive.

It's a monster's favorite thing in the world, maybe.

If that will is turned off, it's okay if it's not.

He enjoys the process.

-Currrrr!

In the monster's right hand, once again, the torrent of souls is young.
