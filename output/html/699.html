Epilogue - The End of the World



After the New Empire promulgated a law recognizing land ownership by peasants who cleared the ruined lands, groups of pioneers left the city.

There's still a lot of vacant land, and on the uncleared land, the grass sways in the breeze, and the growing crops poke their heads up cautiously.

Small towns where rural people might stop by, but no reason for urban people to visit.

The southwestern tip of the continent.

A small to medium-sized city that is part of the Safe Zone, but is neither a strategic nor a stronghold city, and thus far removed from the gaze of the Empire.

Imperial Mandate, Leanda.

Many small villages have sprung up since the war, where villagers make a living by consuming the crops they grow and selling the surplus to Leanda.

Then, in a small, unnamed farming village on the outskirts of Leanda, there was a strange visitor.

A man who was more of a tramp than a guest.

One such man had been staying in an abandoned barn that had been empty for quite some time, ever since the cow he shared with the village died.

A man leaning back against the wall of a barn, next to rotting straw, dead and motionless.

-Mr.

Toward him, a girl ran, her rich, long brown curls bouncing.

"......."

Slowly, like a dying giant tree moving, the man raises his head and looks at the girl running toward him.

The girl who came running at the sound of the moon holds out her hand to the man.

"Uncle, you haven't eaten, have you?"

"......."

"Eat this, your mom said to bring it to you."

In the girl's hand were three steamed potatoes that had cooled.

My mom told me to bring it to you.

It was a lie.

Because no town likes a strange bum.

The man looks at the water girl, then takes one of the potatoes and puts it in his mouth.

"Here, I brought you some water."

A bite of potato.

Take a sip of water.

Slowly, lazily, as if performing a ritual, the man performs the movements separately.

She watches in wonder as he eats his potatoes and drinks his water.

A man in a cloak that looks like a giant.

He was eating potatoes with only his left hand and drinking water with only his left hand.

The man's hollow right shoulder, shrouded in a ragged cloak, speaks volumes.

The man had no right arm.



* * *



The girl patiently waited for the man to nibble on the three potatoes.

"Thank you."

The girl smiles broadly as she accepts the empty bucket of water with a brief thank you.

In the distance, men carrying farming implements click their tongues as they watch the man in the barn and the girl talking in front of him.

-Want. They won't listen to you if you say that, so use want.

-Sandy Don't you think you should give your mom a hard time?

-Where is he going to get off talking?

-although.......

The mutterings of the villagers reach the man's ears as well as the girl's.

"Don't worry about it. Grown-ups are just scared of strangers."

"...... Of course."

To the girl's more-than-adult comment, the man replied.

It's natural for adults to have vague fears.

An unidentified bum lying on the street.

It was Sandy who found the tramp, screamed at him, called the adults, and brought him to town.

One-armed tramp.

The villagers ask him questions, but he tells them nothing about himself.

His movements were slow and his eyes were barely focused, as if he was dying, or worse, already dead.

Everywhere you look, it looks ominous, or like it has some sort of terrible disease.

That's why it's odd that Sandy's side is so close to this ominous bum.

It's not a deserted town, so we didn't kick him out, but no one wanted to get too close to the bum.

After sobering up at Sandy's house, the tramp took up residence in the town's abandoned barn, where he sat for the rest of the day until Sandy's mother politely asked him to leave.

The rest of the time, I was sneaking in potatoes, sweet potatoes, or bread slices that Sandy would bring.

I'm not going to sit on my ass forever.

The villagers gave him that look whenever they saw him sitting idly in the corner of the barn.

The man barely moved for the rest of the day.

No one came to visit unless it was Sandy, and passersby wondered if the man had been left for dead.

It's also true that Sandy is an outlier.

The other children in the village didn't approach the ominous tramp either.

Or a man-eating ghost.

Or the ghost itself.

There was a lot of speculation among the kids about the bum.

No matter what the kids said, no matter what the adults said, Sandy took care of the bum.

And so, it was about two weeks before a tramp took over the town's barn.

Now I just need you to leave me alone.

The villagers' patience is beginning to wear thin.

Of course, Sandy doesn't care about any of that.

The bum, whom people suspected of being a mute, would, at some point, say something to Sandy, even if it was just a snippet.

Sandy finishes her meal and smirks at the silent bum.

"Mister, you know what?"

"......."

"This barn smells like it used to when they had cows."

"......."

"I don't even own a cow, and it smells horrible."

Scattered hair and random facial hair.

Naturally, it was bound to stink, and the barn where the man was staying had begun to smell like the cows it once housed.

"I suppose."

The man merely responded to Sandy's words.

It smells terrible.

I see.

Sandy's eyes widened at that simple statement.

"......I thought you were telling me to take a bath?"

"......."

"There's a waterfront in front of here."

The man doesn't respond to everything Sandy says.

Sandy now has some idea.

The man's ears are almost eaten away.

So when Sandy says something, she responds by nodding or shaking her head without really knowing what it means.

And it's not just your ears.

You can see by now that most of a man's senses are quite dull.

The villagers don't know.

It's not just the right arm.

The man's missing arm stands out too much, but his whole body is diseased.

Sandy grabs the man's arm.

Not being understood doesn't mean the conversation isn't happening.

"Come on. I'll get you cleaned up."

"......."

Sandy tugged hard, and the man slowly, but surely, rose from his seat.

Sandy didn't make it happen, it just happened.

The man is suspicious, speechless, and ominous.

In fact, if you watch him up close and long enough, you'll realize that no one listens better than he does.

Sandy knows.



* * *



Sandy was originally an outcast in her village.

He would go where he was told not to go and do what he was told not to do.

But if you tell me I must do something, I won't do it.

She was a bullfrog of a girl.

The children of the town are excited to hear about Sandy, as they've been in trouble with her pranks and antics since they were very young.

So it's no wonder that Sandy's parents are effectively giving up on her.

Still, it's a little risky this time.

Sandy started taking care of a bum who was obviously dangerous, although she couldn't give a specific reason why he was dangerous this time.

So everyone tries to stop her this time, but as always, Sandy tells them not to, and they work even harder to take care of the bum.

Now they were even dragging the bum down to the stream to wash him.

The bum was yielding to Sandy's touch, not resisting it, as if it were an object.

Not only does he wash his wild hair with tons of soap, but he also cleanses his face and beard.

It was like a tiny mother taking care of a big baby.

-Take off your clothes.

-.......

It wasn't until a neighbor who saw her trying to strip the man of his clothes told her she was in trouble that Sandy stopped her rampage.

"No, you're relying on the kid because you can't do a single thing yourself?"

Sandy is Sandy, but she knows that men have problems, too, and she scolded Sandy.

"......I see."

But the bum only said that.

"You're an offensive little man."

"Don't, Auntie!"

In the end, Sandy's polarity forced the village anak to return home, unable to bear the bitterness any longer.

The next day.

Sandy could see that the man had somehow managed to wash his clothes clean.



* * *



It's early the next morning.

He could see the man, still dirty but with all the clothes he was wearing washed and dried, leaning his back against the wall of the barn.

"What, did you do this by yourself?"

"......Yes."

Sandy smiles coyly at that short answer.

She then strokes the man's head vigorously.

As if to say something complimentary.

"Good for you, mister, you can wash yourself."

"......."

"...... is a tease?"

"......."

"I can't tell if I'm being heard or not."

Sandy can't figure out what the man is thinking either.

Sure enough, I had washed my clothes and body somewhere overnight, but I didn't smell as bad as I used to.

But his clothes are worn and tattered, his hair is a mess, and his beard is growing out of nowhere.

What Sandy brought today was thinly sliced bread.

"My mom, don't hate me so much. He's just scared."

"......."

"You know I'm bringing you food, so I'm paying your share?"

"......I see."

I don't like it, and I don't want to do it.

We all have those moments when we can't help ourselves.

I hate and fear the unknown bum, not to mention Sandy's weirdness.

It would be a shame to let them starve to death.

I can't get my daughter to stop being a weirdo, and I'm pretty sure she's not going to eat her share and give it to a bum.

Eventually, Sandy's mother reluctantly cooks enough food for Sandy to have some left over to give to the bum.

The townspeople want the tramp to go away, but they don't want him to die in town.

So you're afraid of the bum, and you hate Sandy's behavior.

In the end, you can't help but be happy.

I thought Sandy was just an out-of-control talker, but then I realized there was a kinder, gentler side to her.

And Sandy didn't just bring bread.

Suddenly, from out of nowhere, Sandy pulls out a knife.

"Mister, stick your chin out."

Sandy's eyes flicker and she wields the knife menacingly.

"......."

"Unsightly beard, I'll shave it off."

Sure enough, the man was looking at Sandy with cloudy eyes, neither frightened nor panicked.

"I've seen my dad do it so often, so maybe I'm good at it."

Sandy grabbed the man by the end of his chin and lifted him up, plunging the knife under his chin, but he didn't react.

-Square

"...... Is this correct?"

A girl who never shaves her beard shakes her head with clumsy hand gestures.

The man just stood there, not sure if he didn't care or if he couldn't feel.

"Oh....... I think I'm on to something......."

Obviously, your first shave won't be a comfortable one, and it's not a razor.

So it was bound to be sloppy.

Soon, as Sandy, who was so close to the man's face that she could practically touch him, was shaving his chin and nape, she realized something was wrong.

"......Hmm?"

I realized there was something around the man's neck, something hidden by his clothes.

A ring with a small silvery chain attached to it.

In the center of it all, a necklace with a crimson gemstone.

I could tell even by looking at it that it wasn't just a gem. It wasn't just a crimson color, but the crimson color was swirling around in the gem, as if it were a vortex.

"Uncle....... What is this......?"

Sandy was about to reach for the necklace out of curiosity.

-Tak!

"Bam!"

The man, who until now had been as slow as a turtle, grabbed Sandy's wrist roughly.

The man's blurry eyes found focus.

Then, precisely, look Sandy in the eye.

"Don't touch it."

At that strong, almost imperative warning, Sandy nodded dumbly.

"Ugh, ugh....... Yeah."

Even Sandy, a do-or-die kind of girl, couldn't help but nod her head in agreement at the gravity of the man's words.

The man hides the exposed crimson jeweled necklace back into his clothes.

Sandy feels awkward and starts to shave the man's beard, who is now speechless again.

Of course, I was still clumsy.

"Hey, what are you doing!"

"Ack! Surprise!"

He even held a knife to a man's throat, and when a villager misunderstood it to mean something else and cried out in fright, Sandy teased the knife the wrong way and still managed to cut the man's cheek.

"Uh, uh, uh, ah, mister. Sorry......."

"......."

"Auntie, you scared me!"

"Sandy, what are you doing dangerously, can you stop?"

Even though his cheek was cut and starting to bleed, the man didn't seem to feel anything, just stared off into space with cloudy eyes.

In the end, Sandy had to go to the trouble of calling in the old woman from the village to sanitize the bum's cheeks and apply a cotton bandage.

I also took a knife to my overly scattered and unruly long hair and gave it a bit of a makeover.

"Um......."

Sandy stares at the roughly shaved, groomed man.

"...... is your brother, not your uncle?"

Intrigued, Sandy stares at the man's face.

But here's the kicker.

The man who was sensitive to the necklace, even though he hadn't touched it, is grave despite the wounds on his body.

What the heck is that necklace?

Sandy couldn't help but wonder even more.

A man who has nothing wears a necklace that looks mysterious and precious, even when he doesn't.

"Is that necklace of yours some kind of great treasure or something?"

In response to Sandy's question, the man's eyes slowly move to look at Sandy.

"......No."

I don't pretend I didn't hear it.

"Never, ever."

The man leans back against the wooden wall of the barn, his eyes closed.

"But, more than anything else in the world, ....... than anything else in the world."

It was the longest answer Sandy had ever heard from a man.

The most important thing in the world.

But not the treasure.

Sandy couldn't understand the man's words.

If it's important, is it not a treasure?

If it's not a treasure, why is it the most important thing in the world?

Sandy laughs bashfully.

With an evil grin.

"Why does someone like you have the most important thing in the world?"

How could a bum lying on the street, dying, have such a thing?

Sandy, who's been taking care of the bum all this time, deserves that evil joke.

At Sandy's words, the man looks up at the sky in confusion.

"...... Even I don't know that."

Sure enough, the man had a faint bitter smile on his face.

I'm taking care of him, but he's really weird.

Thinking about it, Sandy gently stroked the man's hair, which looked a little sad.

-shootaaaaa

The day it rained so hard it felt like the world was drowning.

There was a nasty, nasty fight that no one saw.

'For an old monster like this, I suppose this is a fitting end.......'

The last monster to be pierced through the heart by the golden spear was rather pleased.

'In the only era where all five holy symbols appeared, the last one pierced his heart and killed him....... What an undeserved ending.......'

Ludwig watched, wide-eyed, as the last monster was slain, seemingly happy to be dead.

Dying.

The old monster broke open his chest and pulled something out of it.

The old monster was laughing.

'O boy.......'

"If you really want to be a hero, you have to.......

'You'll need to take this.......'

'This, if left alone, would destroy the world.......'

'If you carry it, it will destroy you and you alone.

'As long as you are not destroyed, as long as you endure, the world will be at peace.'

"The Holy Grail of Courage.

"A holy object that gives you the power to defeat anything.

"You will give me the strength to endure this.

'Never, never will I give you the power to surpass it.......'

'Perhaps a lifetime of carrying this.......'

'That is the honor you should bear.'

'It would be doomed.

"Maybe, you know.

'See if you can find a way to extinguish this once and for all.......'

"But that day will probably never come.

'Master of the last holy relic.

"Apostle of Courage.

'You won, but.......'

'Having triumphed, to bear eternal ruin.......'

"To carry the burden of someone else's sins, sins you didn't commit, for the rest of your life.

'That must be your destiny.......'

'And, no one will remember you.......'

'How is this.'

"I'm thrilled.

"Glorious.

'Is this a disastrous ending.......'

The last monster laughed, as if greatly satisfied, and disappeared, dissolving into the raindrops.

The crimson jewel it left where it died, he couldn't help but take, not knowing what it was.

The moment he held it, the man had a hunch.

That it is your destiny to carry this with you for the rest of your life.

You won, but.

I knew there was a price to pay for victory.

And so on.

Every day was hell for a man.
