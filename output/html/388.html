            Episode 388.





On the terrace, Bertus and I were having tea for the first time in a long time.

Two holy relics.

I already knew I was the master of Tiamata. When Saviolin Tana warned me, I had some sense of it.

Bertus looked like he was about to say something, then hesitated slightly, as if the words were caught in the back of his throat.

My fingertips tremble.

You asshole.

I'm thinking about that again!

"......."

Bertus mumbled something and then said nothing, as if he believed that talking was already showing.

"Well, never mind, that's not the point. That you have the choice of two holy objects. That's all that matters."

Yes.

Let's get that out of our heads.

I'm sure we'll get to the real messy stuff soon, but I'm tired of being messy in this way.

If you're good enough to be chosen for two holy relics, you're a Ragan Artorius-level badass, so why the hell are you cross-dressing?

I don't want to hear about that!

Bertus stares at me with a serious expression.

"I have a lot of questions, Reinhardt."

"......Yes."

"Not that one, asshole!"

"Oh, I didn't say anything?"

Bertus and I couldn't be serious after that incident!

"Charlotte."

But when the name came up, I couldn't help but calm down.

"You did this, didn't you?"

It's about knowing and asking.

I can't deny it. I didn't ask specifically what you did or how you did it, because I don't think that's necessary.

"Yeah."

"Yeah, it's nice that you're not just throwing things out there without meaning to."

You already know everything about me and Charlotte. Bertus adds milk to his black tea and stirs it with a teaspoon.

"Reinhard, I can't touch you anymore, and you're not an idiot, I think you know that."

"......."

Not one, but two holy relics.

It makes no sense to kill or harm me. My existence has become so important that the option of touching me has been eliminated. Even if I were on Charlotte's side.

That's the scary thing about Bertus.

Don't say what or how much you know.

How much we know about Charlotte's current condition, whether we know that we saved her life or how we did it.

You don't expose it at all, and then suddenly say you know the middle ground of truth as if it were a given.

Confuse the listener.

So, I don't know where to stop, and if I do, I'll say something that Bertus doesn't know.

It's a snake-like way of speaking.

"Reinhard, you can be on Charlotte's side, but being my enemy is another choice. You can't be on Charlotte's side and be on my side, but being on Charlotte's side doesn't necessarily make you my enemy."

Bertus stares at me.

"Are you going to be my enemy? Let's make sure of that."

What happens when you tell someone they're going to be your enemy.

Bertus won't say anything about it. He may leave me alone for now, or he may do something about it.

"I'm not going to do that."

"Yeah, that's what I'm hoping for."

It's not what it used to be.

I'm not just a Royal Class student, I have two holy relics. Unless you know that Ellen also has two, I am the only person in the world with two holy relics.

Just as I don't want to have Bertus as an enemy, he doesn't want to have me as an enemy.

Bertus takes a sip of his milk tea.

"By the way, Reinhard, do you know that?"

His expression turns cold.

"The race to the throne is already over."

Bertus declares coldly.

"Charlotte can't be emperor."

I wasn't surprised.

Bertus crushed one of the Empire's greatest threats: revolutionary forces.

That's not all.

While Charlotte hasn't even been able to get herself together, Bertus has been taking care of a lot of things.

Unlike Charlotte, who has had to deal with the aftermath of her demonic abduction, Bertus has proven himself time and time again. Continued from Where I Am Not.

Charlotte, who can't do anything.

Bertus, who kept showing me things.

The imperial succession would have tilted slowly under those circumstances, and after the events of the Revolutionary Forces, it would have passed completely to Bertus.

Bertus's exploits were not publicized, of course, but the emperor would have known about them.

The dice have been rolled, and the results are already known.

"Of course, all of that aside, the mere fact that she's possessed by a demonic spirit means that Charlotte's path to becoming Imperial Emperor has already been cleared."

Did you know that?

The demon's soul and Charlotte's soul were inseparable. As long as Bertus knew this, all it would take would be for him to mock her and her life would be over.

"Reinhard, I don't know if you'll believe me when I say this, but I don't want to kill my brother."

He said it with such a cold expression that it was even harder to believe what he was saying.

"Why do you think that is?"

Because they are siblings.

That would never be a reason. A reason would mean that it's better not to kill Charlotte after all.

There's only one reason.

"...... Is it me?"

"Yeah."

Any harm to Charlotte would make me an enemy of Bertus. I am determined to do so, and Bertus will know it if he knows what I have done. And Bertus has told me that he does not want me as an enemy.

"I think I'd get a chill down my spine if I had an out-and-out lunatic like you as an enemy."

Reinhard the school bully becomes Reinhard the bully warrior. The scope and scale of what you can do changes.

Finally, if Lagan Artorius had lived, no one in the world would have been able to treat him with such disrespect, and no one would have sought to be his enemy.

If you kill Charlotte, you will have me as an enemy.

That's why Bertus says it's good for him not to kill Charlotte. Because the existence of the country has become an obstacle.

"Well, I have no choice but to kill Charlotte."

"......Why?"

"There's no reason to keep her alive. Charlotte's very existence already affects my imperial power, which means that if she lives, whether after I'm crowned the next emperor or after I'm crowned, they'll be telling me a hundred times a day to kill her. They'll be saying it in my ear for days, months, and years, and if I refuse, they won't understand me, and my subjects would rather have a cruel monarch than a weak one, that's for sure. I can't afford to discredit them by letting Charlotte, a strong contender for the throne, live for no good reason, can I?"

A strong imperial heir, if he survives the elimination, is in itself a threat to the empire. It's not out of the realm of possibility that there could be an uprising of supporters to replace Charlotte, or that there could be a movement to support a new emperor if Bertus screws up.

There would be no reason to keep Charlotte alive, and Bertus would be forced to kill her against his will.

You don't want to kill it. But it must be killed.

Charlotte said something like that.

If you don't become emperor, you will die.

From the beginning, their fight was about becoming emperor or dying. At both forks in the road, they were unable to determine their opponent's life or death by their own will.

If you survive, you must kill your opponent.

However, Bertus is in a situation where if he kills Charlotte, he will have made an enemy of the state.

"This is the problem. If you die fighting a demon, I don't know, but if somehow things work out and you kill the demon and become the hero of mankind and I become emperor, I don't know what you're going to do to me because you're out of your mind. But if the demon dies and then I kill you, the hero of mankind, ....... I'd be Emperor and you'd be Nabal. And what do you think would happen if the Emperor killed Ragan Artorius, who came back from the dead, because that's exactly what would happen."

Don't be afraid to be overly gory.

I can't believe you're so blithely telling me that it's in your best interest to be annihilated like Lagan Artorius while I kill demons.

Of course, if I were a real warrior, I might be afraid of Bertus plunging his sword into my throat, but I am physically incapable of fighting a demon.

Bertus must kill Charlotte.

But if you kill it, you're doing something very dangerous.

"So, if you end up killing Charlotte, understand that it's unavoidable....... What. Is that what you're saying?"

At my words, Bertus shook his head.

"There's no way you're going to believe that."

As if to say otherwise, Bertus smiled wryly.

"I thought you said there was no reason?"

"...... did."

There's no reason to keep Charlotte alive.

So the entourage will argue that Charlotte must be killed to consolidate the imperial power, and Bertus has nothing to say against that.

"So, you need a rationale."

A reason, a rationale.

"An excuse for me not to kill my brother."

A reason for Bertus not to kill Charlotte if he becomes emperor. A reason for the entourage not to demand that Charlotte be killed.

Bertus stirs his teacup and smiles wickedly.

In the matter of Charlotte's soul, it comes back to politics.

A girl who must die no matter which way she goes.

Charlotte De Gradias.

"You want to save my brother's life, don't you?"

You brought Charlotte out of the darkness last time, and now you're going to bring her out of a political situation where she should be dead.

Bertus asks, and I nod falsely.

"Right."

"Somehow?"

"Somehow."

Bertus smirks.

"Marry my brother."

Detomorian's Prophecy.

"There's no other way."

It's only now that I realize that it was predicting this situation.

And.

I couldn't help but wonder what personal favor the Emperor was trying to ask me.

However, a question arose.

"Doesn't that strengthen Charlotte's claim to the imperial throne?"

Having said all that, Bertus has no reason to keep Charlotte alive.

She doesn't want to have me as an enemy, but marrying a holy man empowers Charlotte.

"I suppose."

Bertus must have some idea. He would never do anything good for Charlotte.

However, Bertus didn't tell us what he was thinking.

Or, really, are you feeling sympathy for Charlotte?



* * *



Bertus was already convinced of victory, and he knew it wouldn't be until it was overturned.

And I know that.

Even if Bertus did not exist, it is unclear whether Charlotte would be able to become emperor. The people realize that Charlotte has become one with the demon's spirit, and unless she can fully control her dark powers, she will become the master of a sinister force.

That in and of itself, apart from all other matters, makes Charlotte unfit to be emperor.

Therefore, Bertus already does not recognize Charlotte as a competitor. However, if he kills Charlotte because he is urged to do so by his entourage, he will have an enemy.

That's what Bertus is saying.

I'm a little scared.

I am the master of Alsbringer and Tiamata.

If Charlotte were to marry me, my status would increase, but her safety would decrease.

If the fight against the devil becomes visible in the future, my presence is bound to be revealed.

The hero of mankind, the hope of mankind.

This shitty modifier will stick to me.

And if Charlotte becomes my wife, the empire cannot touch her, just as it cannot touch me. Whether Bertus becomes emperor or not, there will be no talk of killing Charlotte until I am dead.

I'm sure the Emperor knows that. So he stopped trying to ask me for a favor of that nature. He couldn't ask me to do something for personal reasons, because he had become too much of a force to be reckoned with.

I'm sure Charlotte knows this.

To save Charlotte, I must marry her. Now that Alsbringer is in my hands, my case is even stronger.

That's why Bertus has been talking. Because he doesn't know what he'll do if the guy with not one, but two holy relics turns up dead.

But shouldn't I be able to make that decision regardless of Charlotte's wishes?

What the heck is Bertus's intention.

-Ka-ching!

"What do you think?"

"....... No. Just."

"Hands."

Ellen helped me to my feet as I stumbled backwards.

What am I supposed to do?

I've promised myself so many times that I would protect Charlotte no matter what, and now I have to do it, and I can't save her if I don't.

Well, is that right.
