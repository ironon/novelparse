Delfin Izadra.

I wouldn't say we were close, but we were classmates and after the desert island mission, he kept flirting with me.

The guy who should have survived to the end, and one of the two main heroines, is dead.

So vainly.

Unable to fight anymore, Ludwig is likely to stay away from fighting.

If this means that Ludwig, who was supposed to die in the original, survives a non-battle ending, I wonder if that's a good thing.

Now that I've taken on Ludwig's role, I think he deserves to live.

We don't know what Ludwig's vacancy will look like, and we don't know if he'll lose his role in the war.

Or maybe they're still trying to fight.

But in that case, Ludwig will most likely die.

It would be foolish to lose your right arm and try to fight with your left.

I hope he doesn't dream of such a thing, but there's no telling how reality will roll now.

I heard a shocking revelation from the Royal Class side, and after all, I couldn't be the only one.

Harriet, Liana, and Charlotte.

When they heard the news of the royal class, they couldn't help but make faces.

Charlotte cried for a long time when she heard of Delphine's death and Ludwig's injury. To her, they were classmates in the same B class, and she would never be able to hear the story as if it were someone else's.

Harriet couldn't hold back her tears, and Riana was speechless.

But there's no point in mourning.

We eventually had to take the next step, and there was too much work to be done to stop.

Tears should be swallowed inwardly.

I tried not to consciously think about the Royal Class thing, and didn't mention it.

Not mentioning it doesn't make it go away, but no one talked about it, even though we had agreed not to mention it to each other.



* * *



The Allies will winter in Serandia.

If it's a climate problem, we can fix it, but Riana's powers are mind-eating.

We can't always help the Allies, so it was okay for them to winter in Serandia.

It's not just the weather; you've just faced a major battle, and you'll need time to repair and refurbish your army.

We won't be able to forget someone's death this winter, but I hope we can get through it.

"The Allies will be inactive for a while, so we won't be either."

The time of year is winter.

If the Allies don't move, there's not much reason for us to move.

We're at war, or should I say, we're in a war, but eventually there will be a few months off.

The Allies would have time to reorganize, improving their Titans in preparation for the next advance, and trying to deal with the shock, horror, and grief of so many deaths.

"Great One, is it not necessary to have a countermeasure against the Titans?"

"......Countermeasures?"

"Yes."

Antirrhinus said.

"You are the only one who has seen the Titan in person, but I have heard that he is the size of a mountain and can crush hundreds of monsters with a single step. Is there any reason to believe that step will not be directed at us?"

"They don't know where we are in the first place. Even if they did, do you really think a Titan would cross the ocean to get here?"

I don't know if the Titan is big enough to walk across the ocean, but I don't think it will.

"There's always a what if, right?"

"Hmmm......."

For now, we're helping the Allies, but we don't know when war will break out.

Let's say a Titan and I are fighting.

Me fighting a golem as big as a mountain.

I'm getting shy just thinking about it.

Come to think of it, I think there was a game like that.

"We don't think it's a bad idea to have a weapon similar to the Titan either......."

I sighed at Antony's words.

I see where this guy is coming from.

"You don't just want to have a Titan or something, do you?"

"......Hmm, isn't that interesting, a giant golem that never existed in the world."

and.

The look on that old man's face, like, "I've been caught," makes me think there's something in there.

Is this a joke?

I mean, this old guy is not a kid, and he's saying this with the mindset of approaching some kind of toy?

Has dementia finally set in?

I had a sneaking suspicion, but is it true?

"Hey, Harriet, do you think we could build something like a Titan?"

"If you have the plans and the materials, there's nothing you can't build. But you don't have the plans, and even if you did, you don't have the materials."

"That's a part of Titan that already exists......."

"Shut up, old man, I'm not building a Titan, and I'm not going to steal it."

"That's too bad......."

Antirhynchus was getting a lot of frustrated looks from the wrong places.

"If you pull some bullshit about how you've suddenly stolen control of Titan, I'm going to make you feel what it's like to be decapitated by a holy sword for real this time, so don't you dare."

Antrianus chuckled at my harshness and nodded in understanding.

I don't know what that old man is going to do, and I'm not at all comfortable with it.

"But, Your Majesty. Antrianus' words about the need for a countermeasure against the Titans seem reasonable."

Antirrhinus's futile rantings eventually reached Sarkhegar, who returned to Edina.

"Why the hell would you fight something like that? It's just a bunch of unintelligent monsters, and we see it and we charge at it. We have intelligence and we can think. If there's a Titan in front of you, you run. Why would you even think about fighting it?"

"But what if the Titans come across the ocean and end up here? We can't abandon this place."

"What's wrong with your sister!"

"No, am I wrong, you're right."

Eventually, even Olivia sighed heavily with worry.

I mean, we know we're going to clash with the empire later on, but why is everyone taking it like it's a foregone conclusion?

But.......

Right?

Let's say the war breaks out, and you've solved the uptime problem.

Let's say a Titan crosses the continent and raids Edina.

Then what?

Titans are supposed to have as much defense as they do offense in the first place, right?

I can't make mountains out of molehills, and neither can anyone else here.

Should I smash it with a meteor?

My thoughts were shifting toward the need to have a Titan plan.

"If we assume that ...... can't travel through space, then the Titan can't even get here."

It wasn't me who came up with the answer, it was Charlotte.

"......? Why can't you come?"

"I haven't seen it, but I hear the Titan is big."

"Uh, a lot."

"I don't think a chunk that big can cross the ocean properly, and you'll be lucky if it doesn't get swept away by the currents. Don't take the ocean too seriously."

"......, right?"

"And we have mermaids."

"What's a mermaid got to do with a Titan?"

"Mermaids can manipulate ocean currents."

"......? Really?"

"......Didn't you know?"

This is the first I've heard of this today.

Charlotte seemed surprised that I didn't know.

"I heard the mermaids had a lot to do with the smooth sailing from Edina to Port Mokna so far. I don't know what they did with the weather, but they manipulated the currents to help us sail."

Since I don't encounter mermaids in person very often, I assumed that they would bring me fish, but apparently not.

Charlotte's so concerned with ruling Edina that she seems to have learned something I didn't. The demons recognize her as a demon, so she's probably treated as an equal to me.

Mermaids....... They weren't just pretty girls.

It was like a succubus or something.

Excellent.

I picked the right person.

Of course, I wonder if it's just me not knowing what I need to know.

"Anyway, if the Titan tries to cross the ocean and attack us, the mermaids will capture it and it won't be able to get here by spatial travel in the first place."

Antirrhynchus was obviously thinking about capturing the Titans, and Sarkegar and Olivia were relieved to hear that they weren't going to be attacked.

"Anyway, we'll just have to reorganize until the Allies leave, which isn't going to happen yet, but we also have to think about what we'll do if they run out of food......."

The Allied forces will have to operate large groups for very long periods of time, so there is a possibility of food shortages.

I'm not sure how much we can do about it if that happens.

While the Alliance takes time to reorganize, we need to find something to do.

"Reinhard, we need to augment our forces."

"Power up?"

Olivia said.

"Replenishment, not augmentation. We used up a lot of Deathknight in the Serandia campaign, too."

Death Knight.

Olivia, who has access to Kier's Holy Power, can summon Deathknights, and they were a big part of our last Serandia preemptive attack.

"I thought you could summon that thing at any time?"

"......what."

and.

I haven't seen that look on your face in a long time.

A genuinely pitiful look.

"You can replenish your Death Knights, of course. Or summon Deathknights at will. But it's all about the base, isn't it?"

"Bass?"

"So, is it stronger to make Deathknight from Reinhardt, or is it stronger to make Deathknight from that kid over there?"

"......Can we not talk bullshit?"

"Let's start with the results: that wimpy kid can't even be a Death Knight. You're going to get a skeleton, white and skimpy, but cute."

The sound was eerie to hear, and Herriot's eyes widened.

Death Knight with me as an ingredient.

Death Knight based on Heriot.

I don't like to think about it, but the result is probably obvious.

"Before the Cult came under our control, some people chose to become Death Knights themselves, and that's what we've seen before."

"......, yes, you did."

In fact, a number of Deathknights had joined them as they brought in the cultists.

Integrating them into the Cult was not without its headaches.

Pagans did a lot of crazy things that were unacceptable to society.

I did all sorts of things to get rid of that noise.

The Death Knights were then purged in large numbers.

Not only is it ominous from the outside, but many of them have been around too long to change their mindset.

"So the Death Knights I summon are either completely devoid of self or dead."

They are literally undead and have no sentience beyond listening to commands.

The conscious Death Knights were purged, and the unconscious, almost machine-like beings were the Death Knights Olivia summoned.

The power of corruption, and the Deathknights who answer its call.

"Anyway, Death Knight doesn't come out of the ground. No, it comes out of the ground, but if you've spent ten gigs today, it's done. It's gone."

"So you're saying you need to replenish?"

"Of course, and of course I like making powerful Death Knights."

Olivia crosses her arms and shakes her head.

"Of course, I can't say that Kieran's powers are exactly impossible to use to create a Death Knight, but it's better to have a good base."

My sister.

I'm starting to sound like an evil warlock.

"So you need good ingredients?"

I don't know if it's the right word, but if it's not an ingredient, what is it?

It's just a little creepy that it's a corpse.

"You mean you're going to use the people who died in this Serandia raid to make....... You're trying to make Death Knight out of......."

Harriet looks at Olivia in disbelief.

And the expressions on the others' faces weren't much different from Herriot's.

Even Antirrhinus stares at Olivia with his mouth hanging open, so that's saying something.

It's a matter of being surprised and feeling like, "What a stroke of genius!

Many have died. And the great and the good are dead.

If you make Deathknights out of their corpses, it's a no-brainer that they'll make excellent Deathknights.

But isn't that a little cruel, regardless of whether it's possible or not?

"Hmm, I was thinking about that, but it's probably going to be difficult."

Well, at least they did it if they could.......

"First of all, it's crazy to have a ritual to make Death Knight in the middle of a burning Allied camp, and we probably can't bury that many bodies, so we'll inevitably cremate them, what do you say, Mr. Sarkegar?"

Sarkegar didn't react to being called uncle. Like, whatever.

By the way, Sarkeghar, you look like a lady, not an old man.

Why is my sister always twisted like this?

"We actually do. Most people are buried by cremation. Occasionally, bodies are repatriated to the ecliptic for burial, but it's rare."

Olivia nodded at Sarkegar's affirmation.

"How do you raise a burnt-out bone dust that's gone? You'd have to force it to do something, and I'm not sure what, and it'd be weak, and I don't trust myself to do it in a place where the Crusaders have a permanent presence, let alone the Alliance, without getting my head blown off."

"That's right......."

A place where people mourn the dead, and the dead rise as Death Knights?

And is there anyone who does that?

It's like an ad asking you to kill me.

The environment of the Allied garrison, where you have no choice but to use makeup, and the fact that there are so many people that making Death Knight might lead to a goal.

You can't do that in Serandia because of that.

"So you have a place in mind?"

Aside from whether or not you can do it, where the hell are you going to get the ingredients?

Olivia giggles at my question.

"Imperial Mausoleum."

What?

What did I just hear?

"There are a lot of war heroes and greats lying there, like Nanda Ginda. Let's get some of them up and use them."

"What?! What the hell are you talking about!"

Charlotte paled and jumped to her feet.

"No, who's going to raise up a useless, weak imperial prince or a good emperor, let alone a helpful one?"

"Well, still! Still, that's not....... That's what......!"

Charlotte's face was turning a deep shade of blue as she couldn't take it anymore.

"Heh......."

This is that.......

To wit.

Hyeonchungwon Park robbery....... That's what you're talking about, right?

It's not a bomb, but it's worse than that....... Such.......

To Charlotte's consternation, Olivia shrugged.

"No, it's the end of the world, so what's the big deal about being a great man or a hero? They'll be happy to hear it. Where's the glory in dying and saving humanity? They'll thank me for it."

"Crazy...... year......."

Herriot shook his head in disgust.

It's not just royalty that's buried in imperial mausoleums.

Those whose accomplishments merit burial alongside royalty are also buried there. Those who are buried in the Imperial Mausoleum as non-royalty are greatly honored, as the Empire recognizes their merit.

As such, they will inevitably be heroes or great figures in history.

In conclusion, Olivia's idea of stealing to replenish your Death Knight is the best option from a practical standpoint.

Assuming it works, it's a much better place than Serandia and other battlegrounds.

Allied garrisons are virtually impossible to replenish with Death Knights, and the Imperial Mausoleum is just a matter of averting your eyes.

Sure enough, Charlotte turned blue in the face and shivered.

"If I had to....... I can't help it, but......."

As long as it's an end in itself, Charlotte wants to scream no, but she doesn't think she has the right to, so she sits back.

"But can the remains properly become Death Knight?"

"I haven't done a lot of this shit myself, so I don't know what's going to happen. But the point is, there are a lot of heroes who haven't been buried long."

Olivia giggles.

Sister.......

My sister is scared these days.

"In the immediate future, there will be heroes who earned merit during the Gate incident and whose bodies were properly recovered and put into the imperial mausoleum, and even before that, there was the Demon War, and those who were killed in the Demon War who showed a hint or something will be laid to rest in the imperial mausoleum."

"ah......."

"Right....... do......."

Charlotte nods, looking miserable.

It's a time when heroes abound.

So when Olivia said the imperial mausoleum would be overflowing with remains that could be used to make Death Knight, it had to be true.

Many sacrifices have been made, and will continue to be made until this war is over.

The living are dying.

Does that justify taking advantage of someone's death?

Unknown.

I can't be sure that this cheating won't lead to another cheating.

However, it doesn't change the fact that it's necessary.

No one could deny Olivia's statement that the living were dying, and there was nothing to hide.



* * *



Should we call what we're doing grave robbing?

Grave robbing is essentially the looting of items buried with a corpse. But we don't care about those items, we care about the remains themselves. Morally, this is worse than grave robbing.

Winter.

Just as the Allies were rebuilding, we planned to do the same for ourselves, powering up the remains of the Imperial Mausoleum with Deathknight.

To do that, of course, we have to leave Edina and go to the ecliptic.

There are three members in total.

Olivia Ranze, who will have to raise Deathknight herself. And Herriot de Saint-Ouen, who will help with transportation and escape in case of emergency.

Plus me, in case of a physical emergency.

Airi would be helpful, and Charlotte would be even more helpful, but I didn't want to bring her along. Charlotte would be a sight for sore eyes, and Airi is a demon, so she's limited in what she can do.

"Chet, it's been a while since you and Reinhardt went on a date, and you're catching up."

Olivia glared at Harriet as she prepared to cast.

"How are you going to get to the ecliptic without me in the first place?"

"Why don't you just let us go and pick us up in a couple of months?"

"......Is that really going to take that long?"

"You never know what's going to happen, and I thought the Allies were taking a day off anyway, and I was going to take a day off with Reinhardt."

We'll do this and that until spring," Olivia smirked at me.

What are you talking about, man?

"You wouldn't say that if you looked at the zodiac right now."

"Hmmm....... Is it that bad?"

"Well, it's not that easy to say, but....... Well, I know it when I see it."

If you really want to rest, you're better off in Edina, and the ecliptic is not the place to do it.

The zodiacal gradient of our memories is intact, but the gloomy atmosphere that pervades the city has turned it into an ashen city.

I'm on my way to get a strong undead in the first place.

"Don't say anything stupid when you're supposed to be careful not to get punished, sister."

"Technically, I'm being awakened by the power of God, so why should I be punished? A blessing is a blessing."

"Why is this ...... technically correct?"

Herriot doesn't want to argue, so he continues casting.

Right.

Kieran's power is the power of the gods, and he shouldn't be punished for raising a few undead with his power, but isn't that a blessing in itself?

I'm starting to get a little dizzy.

"I'll be there."

Blue energy lines began to surge from Herriot's body, and soon, with a flash, we left Edina.



* * *



An alley in the ecliptic gradient.

Arriving there by mass teleportation, Olivia held her nose upon arrival.

"......What the hell, what's that smell?"

Even the squeamish Harriet was gagging upon arrival.

An indescribable, nauseating odor filled the alley, a mixture of fishy, rotten, and unidentifiable odors.

Even if it was an alleyway, it was more than adequate.

This is even in the winter, when the odors subside with the temperature.

"Let's get out of here."

"Ew, I think I'm going to throw up....... Ugh......."

"No, really, don't throw up."

"If I throw up, catch it with your hand......."

"I see you're bullshitting, so I guess it's tolerable. Let's go."

If it's bullshit, it's tolerable because you can afford it.

I couldn't wait to get out of there because I was just as disgusted by the unidentifiable smell of the place.

-Woof!

By the way.

A 'real' sound came from behind me.

"......?"

"...... is this guy for real?"

Olivia stared blankly at Harriet, who had her hands on the wall.

-Woo, woo....... Oof!

No, you're trying to stop that from coming up.

"Don't! Don't hold it in, just throw up!"

If you think about it, Olivia is from the Street.

But our paktong is a real princess, and she's not one to put up with this.



* * *



"......."

"Arguing."

"Ha, ha, ha, don't do it, seriously!"

At Olivia's words, Harriet broke down and burst into tears.

I've seen a lot of bad things with my little princess, but now I'm about to see her throw up in an alleyway.

Harriet's eyes were welling up with tears.

Still, Olivia was worried, and when Olivia patted her back a few times, Harriet's eyes widened as she said she felt amazingly well.

"Don't make light of the power of the Holy Cultist."

"......That's not your power, that's God's power, why are you acting like you're so awesome?"

"If that power is manifested through my body, that's my power, why is it God's power?"

"Reinhard, the gods are all crazy, giving this guy power, aren't they?"

Herriot looks at me as if to ask for my approval.

"Meh, sorry......."

"Why are you sorry?"

"Oh, no, what....... Just......."

Before I knew it, I was apologizing.

Ugh! If the gods are weird, it's because I'm weird!

Olivia did, Herriot did, and now it feels like blasphemy is a passive.

Olivia is like, "The gods aren't awesome, I am. And Harriet is like, "The gods are crazy.

Anyway, I made it out of the alley and onto the street.

In the first place, we were wearing robes, and there was nothing for a passerby to recognize or do because Herriot had cast a spell on us.

You've arrived in the Wenster District, south of the ecliptic.

It's more like a temple than an imperial castle.

"Wouldn't it be nice to have something to drink?"

"......."

Still, my darling, in the old days you would have cried and fussed all day about how you looked like an embarrassment to others.

You say you're having a hard time with a douchebag, but that's what you get.

The gloom hovering over the streets was palpable, but I tried to buy Harriet a drink so she could at least rinse her mouth.

"......Holy shit, what's three silver dollars for a bucket of water?"

Not only were there fewer places to buy, but the cost of living was murderous.

It's barely water.

The price of water in the ecliptic is going crazy right now, to the point where you have to get three silver coins for a bucket of water.

Harriet rinsed her mouth with water, a guilty look on her face.

"I don't need to see anything else."

Olivia clucked her tongue briefly as she recognized the reality of the ecliptic in the price of a bottle of water.

I walk the streets, watching the people walking up and down the streets, the people who are obviously hungry even if they pretend not to be.

There is death on the battlefield, but there is a death here called hunger.

It's winter.

Luckily, we didn't see it with our own eyes, but there will be people who are homeless and have nowhere else to go, freezing to death in alleys.

"At least we're better off here, because the situation is worse in the refugee neighborhoods on the outskirts."

An ecliptic that has lost its ability to support itself due to overly dense population.

But an empire with a huge army.

In the meantime, the marginalized are dying.

"Why are there so many people over there, are they rationing?"

-Line up! Line up! Line up!

I followed Olivia's lead and found myself in the middle of a plaza with a crowd of people.

I thought it was food rationing, but it wasn't.

"I'm a recruiter."

It was Herriot who realized what it was.

Controlling the bustling crowd from their high perches were guards, and above them, men dressed as Imperial officers chattered eagerly.

The sound was drowned out by the shouts of the crowd.

"In the military, at least they don't starve."

Olivia said in a low voice with a bitter smile.

If I'm going to die of starvation, I'd rather join the military. It's the same thing to be killed by a monster or starve to death.

It's not about some grand cause, mission, or commitment to humanity.

When you're a soldier, at least you don't starve.

The depleted generals were being replenished this way, and it wasn't that unexpected.

Supplies that are thrown into battle with no training in martial arts, ragged armor, and a spear.

They will be constantly replenished, dying of starvation.

"If we do what we're supposed to do, the war will end early, and that will be good for them in the long run. Let's get where we're supposed to go, and not get distracted."

Hearing Olivia's words, Harriet and I follow suit.

It was a very optimistic, yet eerily sobering statement.

That was the current reality.

"My sister....... That's a little scary."

"I could cry all the way to the bank if it would end all of this, but it won't, will it?"

"......."

I don't cry because tears don't solve anything.

Just as I have changed, just as Riana has changed, just as Olivia has changed.



* * *



The Imperial Mausoleum also contains the graves of great men and heroes who have accomplished great things alongside their predecessors.

We were fully informed by Charlotte about that before we left.

Even if we say we don't care about the remains of royalty, Charlotte has aided and abetted the violation of our ancestors' mausoleums and the use of evil powers there.

Charlotte had a very tough decision to make.

We were crossing the bridge that connects the southern and northern parts of the ecliptic.

To the north, I could see Emperor Emperatos on a hill, and to the south, the temple of Asrai.

The vast refugee camps on the outskirts of the ecliptic were not visible from the center of the city. Better to be invisible than to see it, as it would only depress me.

"If the horsepower train is down, it must be bad in more ways than one."

"I suppose so."

We were traveling on foot, as resources, including magic stones, were so scarce that magic trains, the main mode of transportation in the ecliptic, were not operational except for military and administrative needs.

The construction and operation of the Titans consumed most of the Empire's resources, and we were reminded of this by the stationary horsepower train on the ecliptic.

How are they dealing with the monsters that occasionally attack the refugees?

It's better to be invisible than to think about it.

Olivia gazes at the distant Yellow Star and mutters.

"Heroes have ranks too....... Well, that should be obvious."

Naturally, not all meritorious people can enter the imperial mausoleum.

Only a small percentage of war heroes are given the honor of entering the Imperial Mausoleum. Usually, this honor is bestowed upon those who have died, and even now there are only a few who have already been confirmed while alive.

Anyway.

Not all heroes are in the Imperial Mausoleum.

"I don't think you have to be an imperial mausoleum, just a cemetery in the northern part of the ecliptic, though......."

According to Charlotte, the cemeteries in the northern ecliptic are also buried with revolutionary majors.

This makes sense, because if every hero entered the Imperial Mausoleum, it would be a mess.

The honor of entering the same tomb as royalty is certainly not a privilege for everyone.

Naturally, national cemeteries are larger than imperial mausoleums and have more people buried there.

Demon Wars and the Gate Crisis.

The men who died in those two wars, and who made great majors, are more likely to be found in national cemeteries than in imperial mausoleums.

Technically, those whose remains have not yet decayed or are likely to return are there.

"It's probably easier to get into the National Cemetery on the outskirts than it is to infiltrate the Imperial Palace, so I think we should go there first."

Olivia shrugged at Harriet's comment.

"What do you mean, we're both going."

"I thought it would say something like ......."

Herriot sighed.

"We've got to use what we can. Do you know, maybe one of the famous warriors will wake up?"

The Five Heroes.

Lagan Artorius.

Ragnar Olfy.

Seizaria.

Mullern.

Shaded.

The tomb of the five, apparently, is in the imperial mausoleum.

"You have to assume that the body is there, and that you can get it up."

"I'll go, though I'm not sure how much help my undead warriors will be."

Of course, that's assuming someone left a body behind.

Charlotte was clear about this.

Lagan Artorius's tomb is in the Imperial Mausoleum, but there is no body in it.

There is no Lagan Artorius, who fought the demon and was destroyed, and no body of the demon Valier.

There is no body of Lagan Artorius.

So it can't even be revived.

But in the other four cases, the bodies were recovered.

There are also what we can only call incomplete remains, but they were recovered.

So, aside from the tomb of Lagan Artorius, the bodies of the other four heroes are definitely in the Imperial Mausoleum.

"Lagan Artorius is out of the question, but for the others, I have to go, just in case."

Olivia looks at me as if she knows that, too.

"Can we call this revenge? Reinhardt."

In other words, I'm bringing back the undead to fight those who helped kill my father.

"It's either helpful or it's not. Why bother with all the fancy words?"

"You know, sometimes it's like you have no emotions at all, especially around here."

I guess that's to be expected since they're not actually parents.

If I were a real Valerie, I'd hate Ellen, and this wouldn't have happened.

But I didn't say that.

There's no such thing as love or attachment to ancestral Bali. We've never actually had a conversation.

However, there is such a thing as a guilty pleasure.

We were hoping to avoid a gate situation in Bali.

However, I ended up causing a gate situation.

Valerie's hopes were forever ruined because of me.

A certain guilt and responsibility that comes from that.

That's how I feel about my ancestor Balie.

However, the emotions were not small.
