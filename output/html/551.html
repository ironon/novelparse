            Episode 551





It's not just royalty that's buried in imperial mausoleums.

Those whose accomplishments merit burial alongside royalty are also buried there. Those who are buried in the Imperial Mausoleum as non-royalty are greatly honored, as the Empire recognizes their merit.

As such, they will inevitably be heroes or great figures in history.

In conclusion, Olivia's idea of stealing to replenish your Death Knight is the best option from a practical standpoint.

Assuming it works, it's a much better place than Serandia and other battlegrounds.

Allied garrisons are virtually impossible to replenish with Death Knights, and the Imperial Mausoleum is just a matter of averting your eyes.

Sure enough, Charlotte turned blue in the face and shivered.

"If I had to....... I can't help it, but......."

As long as it's an end in itself, Charlotte wants to scream no, but she doesn't think she has the right to, so she sits back.

"But can the remains properly become Death Knight?"

"I haven't done a lot of this shit myself, so I don't know what's going to happen. But the point is, there are a lot of heroes who haven't been buried long."

Olivia giggles.

Sister.......

My sister is scared these days.

"In the immediate future, there will be heroes who earned merit during the Gate incident and whose bodies were properly recovered and put into the imperial mausoleum, and even before that, there was the Demon War, and those who were killed in the Demon War who showed a hint or something will be laid to rest in the imperial mausoleum."

"ah......."

"Right....... do......."

Charlotte nods, looking miserable.

It's a time when heroes abound.

So when Olivia said the imperial mausoleum would be overflowing with remains that could be used to make Death Knight, it had to be true.

Many sacrifices have been made, and will continue to be made until this war is over.

The living are dying.

Does that justify taking advantage of someone's death?

Unknown.

I can't be sure that this cheating won't lead to another cheating.

However, it doesn't change the fact that it's necessary.

No one could deny Olivia's statement that the living were dying, and there was nothing to hide.



* * *



Should we call what we're doing grave robbing?

Grave robbing is essentially the looting of items buried with a corpse. But we don't care about those items, we care about the remains themselves. Morally, this is worse than grave robbing.

Winter.

Just as the Allies were rebuilding, we planned to do the same for ourselves, powering up the remains of the Imperial Mausoleum with Deathknight.

To do that, of course, we have to leave Edina and go to the ecliptic.

There are three members in total.

Olivia Ranze, who will have to raise Deathknight herself. And Herriot de Saint-Ouen, who will help with transportation and escape in case of emergency.

Plus me, in case of a physical emergency.

Airi would be helpful, and Charlotte would be even more helpful, but I didn't want to bring her along. Charlotte would be a sight for sore eyes, and Airi is a demon, so she's limited in what she can do.

"Chet, it's been a while since you and Reinhardt went on a date, and you're catching up."

Olivia glared at Harriet as she prepared to cast.

"How are you going to get to the ecliptic without me in the first place?"

"Why don't you just let us go and pick us up in a couple of months?"

"......Is that really going to take that long?"

"You never know what's going to happen, and I thought the Allies were taking a day off anyway, and I was going to take a day off with Reinhardt."

We'll do this and that until spring," Olivia smirked at me.

What are you talking about, man?

"You wouldn't say that if you looked at the zodiac right now."

"Hmmm....... Is it that bad?"

"Well, it's not that easy to say, but....... Well, I know it when I see it."

If you really want to rest, you're better off in Edina, and the ecliptic is not the place to do it.

The zodiacal gradient of our memories is intact, but the gloomy atmosphere that pervades the city has turned it into an ashen city.

I'm on my way to get a strong undead in the first place.

"Don't say anything stupid when you're supposed to be careful not to get punished, sister."

"Technically, I'm being awakened by the power of God, so why should I be punished? A blessing is a blessing."

"Why is this ...... technically correct?"

Herriot doesn't want to argue, so he continues casting.

Right.

Kieran's power is the power of the gods, and he shouldn't be punished for raising a few undead with his power, but isn't that a blessing in itself?

I'm starting to get a little dizzy.

"I'll be there."

Blue energy lines began to surge from Herriot's body, and soon, with a flash, we left Edina.



* * *



An alley in the ecliptic gradient.

Arriving there by mass teleportation, Olivia held her nose upon arrival.

"......What the hell, what's that smell?"

Even the squeamish Harriet was gagging upon arrival.

An indescribable, nauseating odor filled the alley, a mixture of fishy, rotten, and unidentifiable odors.

Even if it was an alleyway, it was more than adequate.

This is even in the winter, when the odors subside with the temperature.

"Let's get out of here."

"Ew, I think I'm going to throw up....... Ugh......."

"No, really, don't throw up."

"If I throw up, catch it with your hand......."

"I see you're bullshitting, so I guess it's tolerable. Let's go."

If it's bullshit, it's tolerable because you can afford it.

I couldn't wait to get out of there because I was just as disgusted by the unidentifiable smell of the place.

-Woof!

By the way.

A 'real' sound came from behind me.

"......?"

"...... is this guy for real?"

Olivia stared blankly at Harriet, who had her hands on the wall.

-Woo, woo....... Oof!

No, you're trying to stop that from coming up.

"Don't! Don't hold it in, just throw up!"

If you think about it, Olivia is from the Street.

But our paktong is a real princess, and she's not one to put up with this.



* * *



"......."

"Arguing."

"Ha, ha, ha, don't do it, seriously!"

At Olivia's words, Harriet broke down and burst into tears.

I've seen a lot of bad things with my little princess, but now I'm about to see her throw up in an alleyway.

Harriet's eyes were welling up with tears.

Still, Olivia was worried, and when Olivia patted her back a few times, Harriet's eyes widened as she said she felt amazingly well.

"Don't make light of the power of the Holy Cultist."

"......That's not your power, that's God's power, why are you acting like you're so awesome?"

"If that power is manifested through my body, that's my power, why is it God's power?"

"Reinhard, the gods are all crazy, giving this guy power, aren't they?"

Herriot looks at me as if to ask for my approval.

"Meh, sorry......."

"Why are you sorry?"

"Oh, no, what....... Just......."

Before I knew it, I was apologizing.

Ugh! If the gods are weird, it's because I'm weird!

Olivia did, Herriot did, and now it feels like blasphemy is a passive.

Olivia is like, "The gods aren't awesome, I am. And Harriet is like, "The gods are crazy.

Anyway, I made it out of the alley and onto the street.

In the first place, we were wearing robes, and there was nothing for a passerby to recognize or do because Herriot had cast a spell on us.

You've arrived in the Wenster District, south of the ecliptic.

It's more like a temple than an imperial castle.

"Wouldn't it be nice to have something to drink?"

"......."

Still, my darling, in the old days you would have cried and fussed all day about how you looked like an embarrassment to others.

You say you're having a hard time with a douchebag, but that's what you get.

The gloom hovering over the streets was palpable, but I tried to buy Harriet a drink so she could at least rinse her mouth.

"......Holy shit, what's three silver dollars for a bucket of water?"

Not only were there fewer places to buy, but the cost of living was murderous.

It's barely water.

The price of water in the ecliptic is going crazy right now, to the point where you have to get three silver coins for a bucket of water.

Harriet rinsed her mouth with water, a guilty look on her face.

"I don't need to see anything else."

Olivia clucked her tongue briefly as she recognized the reality of the ecliptic in the price of a bottle of water.

I walk the streets, watching the people walking up and down the streets, the people who are obviously hungry even if they pretend not to be.

There is death on the battlefield, but there is a death here called hunger.

It's winter.

Luckily, we didn't see it with our own eyes, but there will be people who are homeless and have nowhere else to go, freezing to death in alleys.

"At least we're better off here, because the situation is worse in the refugee neighborhoods on the outskirts."

An ecliptic that has lost its ability to support itself due to overly dense population.

But an empire with a huge army.

In the meantime, the marginalized are dying.

"Why are there so many people over there, are they rationing?"

-Line up! Line up! Line up!

I followed Olivia's lead and found myself in the middle of a plaza with a crowd of people.

I thought it was food rationing, but it wasn't.

"I'm a recruiter."

It was Herriot who realized what it was.

Controlling the bustling crowd from their high perches were guards, and above them, men dressed as Imperial officers chattered eagerly.

The sound was drowned out by the shouts of the crowd.

"In the military, at least they don't starve."

Olivia said in a low voice with a bitter smile.

If I'm going to die of starvation, I'd rather join the military. It's the same thing to be killed by a monster or starve to death.

It's not about some grand cause, mission, or commitment to humanity.

When you're a soldier, at least you don't starve.

The depleted generals were being replenished this way, and it wasn't that unexpected.

Supplies that are thrown into battle with no training in martial arts, ragged armor, and a spear.

They will be constantly replenished, dying of starvation.

"If we do what we're supposed to do, the war will end early, and that will be good for them in the long run. Let's get where we're supposed to go, and not get distracted."

Hearing Olivia's words, Harriet and I follow suit.

It was a very optimistic, yet eerily sobering statement.

That was the current reality.

"My sister....... That's a little scary."

"I could cry all the way to the bank if it would end all of this, but it won't, will it?"

"......."

I don't cry because tears don't solve anything.

Just as I have changed, just as Riana has changed, just as Olivia has changed.

The Imperial Mausoleum also contains the graves of great men and heroes who have accomplished great things alongside their predecessors.

We were fully informed by Charlotte about that before we left.

Even if we say we don't care about the remains of royalty, Charlotte has aided and abetted the violation of our ancestors' mausoleums and the use of evil powers there.

Charlotte had a very tough decision to make.

We were crossing the bridge that connects the southern and northern parts of the ecliptic.

To the north, I could see Emperor Emperatos on a hill, and to the south, the temple of Asrai.

The vast refugee camps on the outskirts of the ecliptic were not visible from the center of the city. Better to be invisible than to see it, as it would only depress me.

"If the horsepower train is down, it must be bad in more ways than one."

"I suppose so."

We were traveling on foot, as resources, including magic stones, were so scarce that magic trains, the main mode of transportation in the ecliptic, were not operational except for military and administrative needs.

The construction and operation of the Titans consumed most of the Empire's resources, and we were reminded of this by the stationary horsepower train on the ecliptic.

How are they dealing with the monsters that occasionally attack the refugees?

It's better to be invisible than to think about it.

Olivia gazes at the distant Yellow Star and mutters.

"Heroes have ranks too....... Well, that should be obvious."

Naturally, not all meritorious people can enter the imperial mausoleum.

Only a small percentage of war heroes are given the honor of entering the Imperial Mausoleum. Usually, this honor is bestowed upon those who have died, and even now there are only a few who have already been confirmed while alive.

Anyway.

Not all heroes are in the Imperial Mausoleum.

"I don't think you have to be an imperial mausoleum, just a cemetery in the northern part of the ecliptic, though......."

According to Charlotte, the cemeteries in the northern ecliptic are also buried with revolutionary majors.

This makes sense, because if every hero entered the Imperial Mausoleum, it would be a mess.

The honor of entering the same tomb as royalty is certainly not a privilege for everyone.

Naturally, national cemeteries are larger than imperial mausoleums and have more people buried there.

Demon Wars and the Gate Crisis.

The men who died in those two wars, and who made great majors, are more likely to be found in national cemeteries than in imperial mausoleums.

Technically, those whose remains have not yet decayed or are likely to return are there.

"It's probably easier to get into the National Cemetery on the outskirts than it is to infiltrate the Imperial Palace, so I think we should go there first."

Olivia shrugged at Harriet's comment.

"What do you mean, we're both going."

"I thought it would say something like ......."

Herriot sighed.

"We've got to use what we can. Do you know, maybe one of the famous warriors will wake up?"

The Five Heroes.

Lagan Artorius.

Ragnar Olfy.

Seizaria.

Mullern.

Shaded.

The tomb of the five, apparently, is in the imperial mausoleum.

"You have to assume that the body is there, and that you can get it up."

"I'll go, though I'm not sure how much help my undead warriors will be."

Of course, that's assuming someone left a body behind.

Charlotte was clear about this.

Lagan Artorius's tomb is in the Imperial Mausoleum, but there is no body in it.

There is no Lagan Artorius, who fought the demon and was destroyed, and no body of the demon Valier.

There is no body of Lagan Artorius.

So it can't even be revived.

But in the other four cases, the bodies were recovered.

There are also what we can only call incomplete remains, but they were recovered.

So, aside from the tomb of Lagan Artorius, the bodies of the other four heroes are definitely in the Imperial Mausoleum.

"Lagan Artorius is out of the question, but for the others, I have to go, just in case."

Olivia looks at me as if she knows that, too.

"Can we call this revenge? Reinhardt."

In other words, I'm bringing back the undead to fight those who helped kill my father.

"It's either helpful or it's not. Why bother with all the fancy words?"

"You know, sometimes it's like you have no emotions at all, especially around here."

I guess that's to be expected since they're not actually parents.

If I were a real Valerie, I'd hate Ellen, and this wouldn't have happened.

But I didn't say that.

There's no such thing as love or attachment to ancestral Bali. We've never actually had a conversation.

However, there is such a thing as a guilty pleasure.

We were hoping to avoid a gate situation in Bali.

However, I ended up causing a gate situation.

Valerie's hopes were forever ruined because of me.

A certain guilt and responsibility that comes from that.

That's how I feel about my ancestor Balie.

However, the emotions were not small.
