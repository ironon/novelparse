            Episode 282.





How many times has the strongest knight on the continent had his life saved by someone else? It's been a long time since it happened, if it ever happened at all, since personal power has reached a certain level.

She may have lived her life on the side of saving rather than being saved by someone.

It was a confluence of events, but in the end, I saved Savior Tana's life.

Had it stirred up some forgotten emotion in her?

She obviously bowed to me and thanked me, but she seemed to think to herself that it wasn't enough.

So, if he wanted to do something for me, he probably thought it would be helpful for him to see to my training while he was still wearing the title of Sergeant Major and staying in the Royal Class dorms.

But it would be weird to teach just me and not the other guys, so I'd bring them in and pretend to teach them, but only teach me.

All good.

Good.

But this.......

I'm just going to be the weirdo again.

"Well, you're going to have to watch the other kids besides me......."

"......a."

Tana, who had been focusing on me, turned her attention back to her students.

"Ah.

"I completely forgot!

Please tell me I'm the only one in the world who can subtly read thoughts in that cold, distant expression.

"Well, okay. I think that's enough for you, so let's watch it again."

At my request, Tana once again watched everyone's swordplay. Of course, she didn't put as much effort into it as she did with me, but in the end, it was more than enough for our level.

Neither Erich nor Delphine took the advice.

Saviolin Tana's teachings to me were definitely helpful, but overly ticklish.

It's embarrassing to be told you're great when you're not even close to Scarlett. This guy clearly doesn't understand that too much praise is feeding.

"Well, I think we're all good to go."

Eventually, after another lap, she grabbed me and taught me a few more things before announcing that the midnight extra class was over.

Everyone was pleased with themselves. They seemed excited to see a legendary creature right in front of them.

Of course, it's not really the stuff of legend.

"I know winter break is just around the corner, but I'll be doing these classes from time to time. I'll let you know when I have an idea, so you can come to the training grounds at the appointed time. That's it."

The class was over, and I went home to rest.

"Reinhardt, that's great, you're the only person I've ever heard Lord Tana praise so loudly!"

Ludwig patted me on the shoulder excitedly, as if he'd been complimented.

Delighting in other people's work as if it were your own.

Every time I realize he's a true human being, I realize how much of a jerk I am.

"Just saying."

"No, Reinhardt. It was great."

Scarlett said, with a rare twinkle in her eye.

I mean, do you say that even though you know objectively that you're better at it?

a.......

Lord Tana must know something I don't, because I feel like this.

Erich's grass was badly dead.

I wasn't scolded or told why I was being so mean.

Saviolin Tana simply said she wouldn't look at you, which was a kindness after all. She didn't want to embarrass you in front of the other students.

I wouldn't be able to say I'm good at something I can't do.

As he stumbles back to his class A dorm because the grass is dead.

Scarlett stared at it.

Scarlett, who had been accused of being a witch, is an excellent student and has never been put to the test.

It will be miserable.

There was nothing amusing about the way Scarlett looked at Erich.

All I felt was a stare. It was neither negative nor positive, just a stare.

The look in Scarlett's eyes convinces me.

That Scarlett is now completely free of the dark feelings that stemmed from Erich and him.

It's better to get out of it than to wallow in it. You could say that Scarlett had undergone a positive transformation.

"When is the next class, I can't wait to take it again."

"......Give me a break, will you?"

At my words, Ludwig scratched his head.

"I don't think I'm cut out for real studying, I'm better off doing this."

You're a madman with nothing but muscles for a brain.

I slowed my pace, afraid that if I stayed with them any longer, I would catch the strange aura. Ludwig, Scarlett, and Delphine headed back to their dormitory and I felt a hand on my shoulder.

"Ah....... Lord Tana."

"Sir."

Saviolin Tana looks at me as if to correct my title, as if I am now her teacher.

He's been very sensitive about the way he's been addressed. First he wants me to call him Lord Tana. Now he wants me to call him Mr. because he's a teacher.

"Yes, sir."

She glances around to make sure no one is watching.

"I have a few more things to say about today's lesson."

I'm pretty sure I have an excuse.

"Let's take a walk."

"Sure."

She led the way, and I followed.



* * *



Saviolin Tana and I walked outside the dormitory.

It was night, and it was getting colder, so the normally deserted neighborhood of the Royal Class dormitory was deserted.

"Royal Class is still a fun place to be."





"......still?"

"Yeah."

She walks with her hands in her coat pockets.

She is a Temple senior at EpinHauser. Naturally, she was also from the Temple Royal class.

"I was no different, a kid who relied on his talent to do nothing. A guy who works hard despite his lack of talent. What's so urgent, a guy who grits his teeth and works hard......."

She exhales a white breath.

"And a natural at everything."

Ellen wasn't here today.

So, when you say I'm a natural at everything, you mean me.

I've gotten to the point where I've been told that.

I'm not the Reinhardt of my incompetence anymore, so when I'm told I'm the guy who has everything, I can't really deny it.

Not the guy who brings everything, but the guy who keeps bringing something.

Although that would be more accurate.

"Which side were you on?"

"...... You know it when you see it, right?"

Saviolin Tana looks at me and smiles.

I haven't set her up, I don't know what her Temple days were like, I have no idea what her past history is.

What was Xavier Tana like in his Temple days, in his Royal Class days?

I can see it without looking. It was like Ellen.

"Ellen Artorius. You didn't show up today."

"Yeah, I've got a few things I need to take care of......."

She probably knows who Ellen is just as well as she knows me. I wonder what she would think if Ellen was competing in Miss Temple instead of training.

Do they think it's pathetic?

She's walking through the dimly lit park in her dorm.

"Actually, I don't remember much about Temple."

"......."

"I've been here for six years, and I've only ever lived in a smokehouse. I've had some friends, but I don't even know what I did with them."

Tana's eyes were blank.

I can't count the hours I've spent here, and I have no memories of any other place.

She must have been a fool who knew nothing but the sword.

The time would have been replaced by skill, but she had no meaningful memory of it.

So what should have been a memorable place didn't seem to be filled with anything.

"After graduation, I joined Shanapelle, and I've had enemies there ever since. Before I knew it, they were calling me the best swordsman on the continent, and then some guy named Ragan Artorius took the title from me, and now it's back."

She walks in a daze.

"You can't just fill your life with titles like that."

She sees me.

"Reinhard, don't live too hard."

"......."

He was born with it all.

No, he lives like he's being chased by something.

She puts her hand on one of the park's trees and strokes down its grain.

"If you live too hard, you'll miss too much."

What was she thinking, I wondered, unable to read the emotion in her expression now.

"What did you miss?"

At my question, she unfolded the hem of her coat and pointed to the sword sheath at her left waist.

Rathalos Tempesta.

No, she's probably referring to the sword itself.

"Everything but this."

He lived for the sword and never had anything but the sword.

A man whose life is all white space except for his sword.

Saviolin Tana was one of those people, and I smirked as I watched her wistful and sad expression.

"Isn't that something I can fill in now?"

"......what?"

"No, no, no, what are you doing, talking like an old lady? By the looks of you, I'm pretty sure you'd be my junior right now."

"......?"

What is he talking about?

She looks at me with the same expression.

"Well, you'll be there when you're stronger here, and then you'll be there when you're stronger there, so it's okay to play a little bit now, right?"

"......?"

"Don't you have a vacation or something?"

"There should be....... not."

Saviolin Tana nods blankly.

"So it's not like I have no time at all. You have a relationship, you go out to eat, you travel. What are you doing with the money you make? Aren't you going to spend it all?"

I can't believe I'm going to give a man who's eaten his fill.

This person is actually much older than my original version.

Whatever.

I'm a guy who's been there, done that.

"Well. You know how to play when you've been played."

"If I....... what the hell am I supposed to answer to you?"

She was baffled, as if she had never heard anything like this from anyone in the world. If you're bored with being the most powerful person in the world, you should get a relationship.

I'm such a weirdo.

It sounds so ridiculous that she doesn't even seem upset.

If it sounds too weird, people will freeze up rather than get upset.

"You told me not to be so hard on myself."

"......."

"Before that, I want you to start living that way."

Not only do superhumans age more slowly, but at a certain level, they don't just stop aging, they age like this.

I don't care what your actual age is, if you wear a Temple uniform, I'm pretty sure you're in the same grade as us.

What are you doing pretending to have a life?

"...... or something."

Saviolin Tana eventually burst out laughing at the absurdity of it all.

"I'm not sure you're the future of the empire after all, Reinhardt."

She patted me on the shoulder.

"But he's definitely the weirdest guy in the empire."

Weirdo.

That was also one of the most common things I heard.

She hadn't called me to talk about nothing in particular.

"Soon, the Emperor will wish to see you."

Emperor.

Does it work.

"It's telling them ahead of time not to be surprised when it happens."

Do I want to thank her for saving Charlotte and reward her, or do I want her to do something for me?

I don't know.

But in the end, it was just one of those things I had to face.
