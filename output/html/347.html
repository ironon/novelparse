            Episode 347.





Yuria knew who I was just by my words.

It wasn't just a family, it was the one family left.

I was escorted to the Capital building by Rusinil, and soon I could see what was going on inside.

At this point, employees were still talking in various offices, some of them apparently not succubi.

As we entered the area, which is off-limits to all but authorized personnel, we saw things we couldn't see from the outside.

A succubus employee was standing in front of a group of armed men, giving them a list of precautions.

"Try not to get in trouble, and of course we all know what we're doing is legal foreclosure, but let's keep things in perspective."

"Four!"

"Four!"

"Yes!"

The succubus employee who appears to be in charge of them crosses his arms and shakes his head.

"I don't care if a person gets hurt, but if an impound gets hurt, that's a loss, and remember, if you intimidate me like you did last time and break my statue, you'll be liable."

"Yes!"

"Four!"

"Got it!"

"Of course, you know that collections are also a problem if they're not resolved on time......."

No way.

Are debt collectors slaves too?

The venomous words exchanged in a gentle tone made me dizzy.

Airy.

I have no idea how the hell you got to this point, as I was just writing in the corner of the room!

Yuria headed up the stairs, and when she reached the fourth floor, she found a room with a sign that read, "President's Office.

-Bam!

Yuria rang the bell to let her know she had company, and cautiously opened the door.

-Why, I'm busy.

A voice came from beyond the door, unfamiliar but familiar, somehow slightly sharpened.

"Mr. President, we have a very important guest."

-I told you we're not meeting any ship owners or royalty yet. Tell them to go back.

What the hell is this?

"The one remaining family member is....... has arrived."

-Family? What do you mean family....... No?

Before I could finish my sentence, I heard the sound of scurrying shoes and the door burst open.

Now that I don't have to hide it, I use Sarkegar's Ring to restore it to its original form.

In the guise of a ballet.

The long-lost pink-haired succubus queen.

Airi's figure was there.

"Ah."

Airi watched me as I returned to Valerie's form, and then nuzzled the nape of my neck.

-Wrong!

"Bali to......!"

"Uh, uh, uh....... How are you?"

I know what Airi thinks of me, but I'm still not comfortable with her.

To my delight, Airi grabbed me and wouldn't let go for a while.



* * *



A loan shark office that's called Angel Capital but looks more like the devil than an angel to me.

In the president's office, I, Lucinil, and Airi were sitting at the guest table.

The assistant soon brought out the black tea.

"Oh, I don't drink. You don't have to give it to me."

Lucinil shook her head, covering her teacup with her hand as Airi poured tea into her own cup.

"......?"

"This is......."

"If you know about Elise, you know about the Lord Vampire. I am Lucinil, Gazoo of Demand."

"Load Vampire......?"

Airi nodded dumbly at Lucinil's introduction. I wasn't sure what it meant, but Airi seemed quite surprised to have gotten the help of another Lord Vampire.

"......because somehow I got help."

Now that I think about it, I'm not sure where Sarkegar, Loyaar, and Eleris stand in the Demon Army.

It's just that it's infiltrating the ecliptic, acting as an infiltrator.

Come to think of it, I know far too little about the demonic realm, let alone my own people. Airi stared at Lucinil, then bowed slightly.

"I don't think you've made an example of Valerie and the gods, it's called Airi."

Airi lets out a short shout, then looks at me.

"You must have a lot of questions. Bali."

"......Yes. What's going on here?"

I had no idea what I was doing, how I was doing it, at what scale, or in what way.

"You can only do so much business if you want to take over the world."

It goes without saying.

But I don't think it would have been that simple to pursue.

Airi's ambition was to seize control of the empire's gold coinage and cause an economic crisis. Of course, I told her to do it because she needed a purpose in life, but I didn't expect much.

But Airi was serious about it, and it was clear that it had paid off in a big way, far beyond what she had expected.

"I didn't know anything at first, so I asked a lot of customers for advice."

It started with a bar, and bars are where people gather.

In the early days of the business, there was a lot of trouble with impressions, but Airi and the succubi had no trouble subduing the drunken ones.

As word of mouth started to spread and people started coming in and out, Airi created a VIP system.

Hospitality for people who sell ridiculously expensive alcohol.

Airi talked to them and gained a better understanding of capital.

How money is made. How money rolls. And how they made money.

Some were inherited, some were born, and many more started from scratch and succeeded.

"I thought about real estate and investing, but I decided there was nothing else I could do that would allow me to grow my capital quickly in a short period of time, so that's where I started."

"Does ...... make it easy, or is this?"

"More important than money are the relationships you have with the people who hold it."

Airi may have made money running the bar, but more importantly, she made connections. She borrowed when she needed to, invested when she needed to.

It all seems to have been too easy for Airi.

"Of course, I do this for the money, but I do it because I get to use money as a tool to manipulate people."

Airi takes a sip of her black tea.

Airi smiled as she set her teacup down.





"If you bind them to a debt, you can enslave them regardless of their status."

It doesn't matter if your opponent is a noble, royalty, or a colossus.

Money and bonds are power in themselves. If you bind someone with a huge bond, you own them. Everything he is is yours, and he is a slave to your every word.

The hornless succubus queen was up to no good, enslaving her opponents with money instead of charm.

While payday lending itself has a negative connotation, Airi is doing it in a slightly different context.

It's not about making money.

I do loan sharking to trap people.

To make people his slaves.

"......So, what's going on now?"

"I don't sell alcohol anymore, but I run a loan shark business for the VIPs of the day. Razak is a port city, and the port is constantly bustling with ships heading to the continent and back, so the captains and trading fleets load up on the most valuable trade goods to maximize their profits on each trip to the continent, and the same goes for the return trip. The merchants sell those goods and make a fortune on the markup, which can be as little as four or five times or as much as a dozen times."

"......Yes."

"Obviously, you can't do it out of your own pocket, so you're going to have to take on a huge amount of debt to load up on expensive trade goods, or you're going to have to get investment, in exchange for a percentage of future profits."

You get a stake in the trade fleet in exchange for investing in it. Of course, we know about such things.

"People are greedy. Once you've made a huge amount of money on one trade, you don't want to do it again, safely, debt-free, with just the ships you have. Once you've made a profit, you take on more debt or get more investment to build more ships, hire more sailors and captains, and so on, over and over again. Over and over again. No one is spared."

Airi had seen such behavior over and over again. In the words of captains returning from long voyages, she had tasted their insatiable desire.

"According to the captains and shipowners, the usury people lend money to greedy shipowners at exorbitant rates, and then if they can't pay the debt, they seize the ship or the goods, which is good because the interest rates are high in the first place, and if they can't pay, they can seize the ship. It's a way of making money unless the fleet gets caught in a storm and is wiped out."

Airi didn't just see the captains.

I've been approached by various powerful people in the region, and I've been told a lot of things.

Captains sailing their ships on long voyages to trade.

Shipowners who hire those captains to run their trading fleets.

The moneylenders who lend money to those ship owners.

I figured out the structure of the moneymakers on top of the moneymakers by running a bar.

But somehow, in Airi's case, it seemed to have a different meaning than loan sharking.

Enslave.

The words resonated with me.

"So I'm lending them money, and if they don't make their interest payments, I raise the interest rate or charge them an extra fee, or if that doesn't work, I get a share of the fleet or trade goods."

It's clear that Airbnb is making a lot of money.

"But that would take too long, so I'm doing something a little different."

Airi's dream is to control the gold of the empire. She's already incredibly successful, but it's not enough.

"I'm deliberately messing with the finances of captains, shipowners, tops, and traders who borrow money from the Capital. I want them to borrow to the limit, so that when they have to pay back the interest, they have no money left over."

"......what?!"

"In layman's terms, you force them to default, so they're late on payments, late on payments, late on payments. You brand them as unable to pay, you destroy their credit to zero, and then you can foreclose."

I was taken aback by the unthinkable.

You can do that by simply squeezing the flow of money in a market, and then squeezing the flow of money out of a path.

"If you take down three large trading fleets at the same time, you take down the moneylenders, the merchants whose money is tied up in them, and the local fleets in the Edina Archipelago. It's a chain reaction."

If a large trade fleet goes bust and foreclosures begin, the lenders who were supposed to get paid from it, as well as the local fleets that were supposed to transport the incoming trade, are out of luck, and so are the people who were caught up in it.

A subcontractor's downsizing following the bankruptcy of a large company.

"A large fleet has been wiped out, and merchants are unable to buy or sell trade goods."

"Captains lose their ships."

"Sailors lose their jobs."

"Sailors without money can't drink."

"Then the bar will go out of business because it can't sell alcohol."

"And just like that, it falls over like dominoes."

"It paralyzes the economy."

With a nonchalant expression, Airi drank the last drop of black tea in her teacup.

Wasn't that the point of being a slave after all?

Destroying a country's economy? Why?

"You're not going to make money, you're going to cause an economic crisis, why?"

Airi smirked at my stupid question.

"It's about getting rid of the trade fleet cartel in the Edina Archipelago."

"......?"

Again, the words were unexpected.

"If I have a lot of money, how can I control the flow of money in the market? No matter how much money I have, it's not enough."

Airi looks out the window of her office.

"It's all because Edina Royal Bank has my back."

A lender with unlimited creditworthiness.

"It's not that the Edina Archipelago doesn't have a giant warp gate to the continent, it's that they can't build one even if they wanted to. If it's a matter of distance, why not just build one on an uninhabited island at a waypoint along the way and you don't have the same problem?"

"......No way."

"Yeah, we can't because of the organized sabotage by the Trade Fleet Cartel."

Installing a giant warp gate in the Edina Archipelago wasn't impossible.

It hadn't been installed because of opposition from large interests whose livelihoods depended on maritime trade.

They said something about being royalty or something.

Airi had a pact with the royal family of the Edina Islands to that effect.

"If the cascading bankruptcies of large trading fleets lead to an economic crisis, the Edina Archipelago will inevitably need a massive warp gate to improve the overall economic situation. With this logic, we will cooperate with the Empire to build a mega warp gate."

"......Here."

I'm shocked and amazed.

I sent it to a place that didn't have a giant warp gate, and now I find myself trying to build a giant warp gate with my own hands.

What to say.

I was at a loss for words.

"All I get in return is a 9% stake in the operation of the giant warp gate."

Collapse, not mass fleet takeover.

After that, a monopoly on trade between the Edina Archipelago and the continent.

That was the picture Airi was drawing.



* * *



"How the hell am I supposed to take it that you're trying to build bridges when you've sent ...... to places the Empire can't reach?"

Airi grinned bitterly at me.

"You're walking on thin ice on the ecliptic, and I don't want to take any risks from this safe place and trust you to fix everything."

Believing that there was something she could do, Airi tried to do something. She even suggested that they sell themselves as slaves to humans to raise capital.

Airi was not alone after all, she had connections to the royal family of the Edina Archipelago.

Without it, we wouldn't be able to build a business of this scale.

"Anyway, the Edina Archipelago relies too heavily on maritime trade, and a massive warp gate between the continent and the archipelago would reduce the social cost of maintaining a fleet and make the economy much better than it is now, so the royal family has been wanting to build one for a very long time."

"You mean to tell me that it's been blocked by those engaged in maritime trade?"

"Yes."

Maritime traders are an integral part of the Edina Archipelago.

"Whenever there's talk of building a warp gate, the maritime trade cartels have threatened to strike collectively and paralyze a country's economy, and I've heard of a few instances where they've done just that, and the economy has collapsed. It's not like a giant warp gate is going to be built in a short amount of time, so how long can you survive if your maritime trade is disrupted in the meantime?"

The maritime trade cartels have been a constant threat to the people of the Edina Archipelago. Though they have outlived their usefulness, they continue to maintain control of the Edina Archipelago through strikes and intimidation.

"So the crown wants to get rid of the sea trade cartel altogether, and while there will be bloodshed and chaos, I've decided it's better to just build a giant warp gate and collapse the cartel once and for all, and if I fail, the crown will cut off my tail."

If Airi's intentions to disrupt the entire maritime trade cartel are read and targeted, the royal family can simply walk away.

"It's too risky."

"Right."

"Even if everything works out as you say, there's still a good chance that the royal family of the Edina Kingdom will come back and stab you in the back."

If things go wrong, they'll cut off her tail, and if things go her way, the royal family will probably puke all over her.

You're taking too much risk.

"No, Valerie, that's not going to happen."

But Airi seemed confident that she wasn't going to get puked on.

"Why?"

"You know?"

Airi smiles coyly.

"Being loved is too easy for us."

And the ship owners they're trying to bring down.

Or someone in the royal family who is secretly working with you.

They all look like they love themselves and know that they will never be abandoned.

Queen of the succubi.

Despite losing her horns, Airi didn't seem to have lost that confidence.

"There are already people who might think what I'm doing is suspicious, who might think I'm crossing a line, and that's why I don't do business with civilians who don't know me."

To themselves, that they were just playing with people who had already fallen for them.

Airi told me not to worry about that at all.
