            Episode 511.





After twenty, I stopped counting.

I've never been able to subdue Ellen.

The amplified pain in the dream was more painful than the actual wound, but it didn't wake him up. Airi was artificially controlling it.

-currrrr

So when I woke up, I could see that the morning sky was cloudy and thunderous.

A storm is brewing.

I could feel Airi's hand still on mine, where it had been just before I fell asleep.

"Good morning....... Morning. You must not have slept well......."

Airi would have had to focus on my dreams, so she wouldn't have slept at all. Airi's expression wasn't too happy either, probably because she kept seeing me dying miserably in her dreams.

Putting aside the question of whether or not this is a good idea, I woke up in the morning with one clear side effect.

"Well, this....... I don't feel like sleeping at all."

"No wonder......."

I woke up and I'm tired.

It's a no-brainer.

After all, dreams aren't meant to last for hours.

But I had the nightmare for the entire time I was asleep, so I was dazed, like my brain was overloaded.

It's more like a side effect of your brain doing extra work while you're asleep.

If I keep doing this, I'm going to be exhausted and unable to push myself when I really need to push myself.

Every day seems a little overwhelming, and I think I need to take a break every other day or two.

On the bed across from him, Harriet was asleep, hugging a large pillow.

"Ugh....... Reinhard......."

Airi hugs her pillow hard, wondering what she's dreaming about, even though she's not the one who touched it.

My Paxton, sometimes you're so cute I want to bite you.

"Do you think this....... work?"

Airi asked, keeping her voice low so as not to wake Herriot.

I was killed dozens of times in one night. And the pain in his dreams was worse than the pain in real life.

After feeling a different kind of spiritual pain, almost devoured by spirits, I guess this is okay.

Just because you've been in pain doesn't mean a little pain isn't pain.

Luna said.

If it's easy to get better, it's easy to get hurt.

It hurts so badly, it's obviously the wrong thing to do from Luna's point of view to try to ignore the pain.

I know that pain now won't buy me happiness later.

It's obvious.

But I can't think of any other way to do it.

To avoid seeing that future I saw in the preview, where Ellen ends up killing me and I end up killing myself.

"I have a feeling it's a necessary evil."

"......I see."

I, for one, am about to die a lot.

"By the way, get some more sleep."

"Uh......?"

"Still, you should get some sleep."

Airi puts her hand on my forehead again.

I didn't feel like I slept at all, which means I need to get some real sleep.

It's hard enough to give someone you care about a nightmare on purpose.

I could have resisted all I wanted, but I surrendered my consciousness to the touch.

"This time, I'm not going to let you dream."

In fact, Airi and I both knew that the best sleep is when you don't dream at all.



* * *



The most elite of the Demon King's forces began to assemble.

The Lords of the Vampire Council and the vampires under their command.

Priests and paladins of the Holy Order.

And an army that includes some of the mightiest of demons.

As a force that needs to maximize its mobility due to mass teleportation, it is not large in numbers, but an elite force of very strong individuals is beginning to form.

The Lord Vampire Houses, the Holy Order's Prelate Olivia Ranze, and Regent Charlotte select their elite soldiers.

He will lead them to clear a path of march for the armies of humanity.

Their vanguard, unbeknownst to humanity, was being organized.

-Rumble

Razak was hit by an unexpected storm.

The waves were rising, and it was getting harder to steer the boat.

The docks were bustling with activity, with ships being anchored more securely to prevent the fleet from being swept away, and the mermaids who gathered the ocean's resources had also slowed down.

A cottage in the outskirts of such and such a Rajak.

The beach in front of it.

"Daughter, why are you getting soaked in the rain?"

Duchess Yelena de Granz.

The woman, no longer a duchess but merely Yelena de Granz, approached her daughter, who was sitting idly on the beach in the rain, and asked.

"......."

Her daughter, better known by her nickname, King Brain, said nothing, just stared blankly at the waves in the distance.

Because of his duties at Fort Mokna, he saw his mother very little.

And since it's not her job to organize an army at this point, she has nothing to do until further orders from the Demon King.

So Riana was now on a non-vacation at her mother's mansion outside of Razak, one of the many villas that the Duke of Granz once owned across the continent.

The first summer vacation at the Temple. Riana spent a few days at the mansion with her friends.

I can't go back to that time. Everything has changed too much.

The word vacation is foreign to Riana.

I can't remember the last time I took a proper break.

You worked hard.

I tried to work hard at everything. I felt like I had to do something, that there was no such thing as time to relax.

There were many moments where she was faced with important choices, and she made them.

And the consequences of that choice.

Riana had created yet another huge disaster in a sad world, and she could do nothing about it.

Olivia Lanzaga.

Reinhardt.

Ellen Artorius finishes.

I have taken over and taken over the things that stem from Riana's sins.

There was nothing Riana could do about it.

Yelena looks at her daughter, who is staring blankly at the beach.

She has no title or authority in Edina. However, by order of the King, she has been granted a certain standard of living and bodyguards, though not as much as she had as a Duchess.

Of course, Yelena knows what her daughter is doing and how important she is.

Your daughter, whom you rarely see, stares blankly at the beach as soon as she gets home.

It's raining so hard, and I'm just standing there in the rain.

It's hard to tell how much guilt is in her eyes, but she eventually puts the umbrella down.

Then she sits down next to her daughter, who sits dazed.

"Riana."

"......Yes."

"Is it hard?"

"......."

At her mother's question, Riana turns her head slightly to look at her.

"I don't deserve to struggle."

"......."

"You can't tell me I'm struggling."

Riana says, and turns her attention back to the beach. Jelena places a gentle hand on her daughter's wet shoulder.

"It's so hard that you have to say that."

"......."

"If it's hard, it's okay to cry."

It's hard enough to say that you don't deserve to struggle.

It's okay to cry if it's hard.

Riana shakes her head at her mother's words.

"I can say that because I'm a mom."

"I can say that because she's my mom."

"Anyone else would have said....... I wouldn't say that."

"I don't deserve to cry."

A mother and daughter who had a terrible relationship.

However, after the death of Duke Granz, things have changed since the Gate incident.

After all, they are the only two blood relatives left in the world.

How sad that is.

What a relief that is.

They are now sadly aware of that fact.

Yelena doesn't know why her daughter is having such a hard time.

"Yeah, I don't know, I don't know why you're doing this, but I guess I can say this because I'm a mom. Because I'm a mom."

Yelena doesn't know what her daughter did.

But you can read something in those eyes.

Indelible guilt.

"I mean, no matter what you've done, no matter how unforgivable you've been. No matter what you've done, no matter how much you've wronged......."

"I'm your mom."

"Because you are my daughter."

"It's okay to cry in front of your mom."

"Even if you can't forgive yourself."

"Even if you don't think you deserve to cry."

"It's okay to cry in front of your mom."

"That's why we're family."

At that, Riana looks at Yelena.

Rhianna, who didn't allow herself to cry because she didn't think she deserved it.

He still can't forgive himself and doesn't know how to come to terms with the many deaths and harms he caused.

I've killed countless people with my own hands.

It killed a lot of people.

-currrrr

On a stormy beach, Riana eventually broke down in front of her mother's smile.

"Mom......."

"Yes."

"You have committed the unpardonable....... sin."

"I see."

"Unforgivable, I thought. Worse than I thought....... Worse than I hoped....... More than I could have ever imagined....... has happened."

Yelena held her daughter still as she began to squirm, her face contorted into a hideous contortion.

"I see......."

"Mom....... Me....... I am....... I don't know how, what to do....... I don't know......."

Yelena couldn't give her daughter the answer.

"If I....... I don't know if I hate something after all, if I'm trying to avenge my dad, if it's okay to be me....... I don't know anymore......."

All I can do is hold her in my arms as she cries with guilt and cry with her.

"That's what I thought....... My daughter. That's what I was thinking....... you were thinking......."

Holding her daughter in her arms, Yelena de Granz brushes her daughter's wet hair and back in the rain.

No answers, no advice, no nothing.

But you can hold them and cry with them.

That's what family is.

"Hmph....... 으흐흑......."

Thunder King (雷鳴王).

Liana de Granz faints in her mother's arms.

The tears that the lightning-wielding psychic has been holding back finally spill out.

Then the sky starts to open up.

The dark clouds have lifted, and the sun is shining through them, a deceptive sight.

It's a muddled image created by real tears, shed from the heart.

The storm created by her powers dissipated in Riana's fever.

Yelena and Riana could only stare at the lying landscape through their tears.

She was Liana de Granz, who learned to control lightning in a fit of rage.

In her grief and guilt, Riana's abilities took another step forward.



* * *



"Uh....... What?"

I could only stare in disbelief for a moment as Riana spoke.

"The last storm, it stopped suddenly."

"You did, I guess?"

The storm came out of nowhere, rumbled on for a few days, and then suddenly tore the sky apart.

This was a very strange phenomenon and caused quite a stir amongst myself and Razak.

Then Riana came by and said she suddenly thought it was her.

"So the storm ended because of me. I don't know if the storm started because of me in the first place......."

"......."

"I know it sounds crazy, I know."

I can see the doubt in her eyes, wondering if the chain of events has caused her to lose her mind. Riana blushed and muttered something incoherent.

"But the timing is....... I don't know what to do with that."

"What's with the timing?"

"That....... Well....... that......."

Riana hesitantly began to explain to me what had happened over the past few days.

Eventually, Riana's eyes widened and she started to sob, unable to wipe the guilt from her face, unable to stop feeling sorry for herself.

Despite all of this, Riana would have been miserable.

It would have been painful to the point of wanting to die.

It was quite painful to see that side of Riana, who had always been strong and tough.

Riana's explanation was long, but it boiled down to this.

I hugged my mom and sobbed, and the storm stopped.

"Gee, really....... I know that's really weird, but the timing of that....... like that!"

Riana's eyes were bright red, her face flushed, and she shouted, then suddenly shrank back.

"That, that....... That's not something I should be upset about. Sorry......."

"Just be yourself, as usual. I don't want to blame you, and I don't want to see you different."

It's more uncomfortable to see her slumped over like this.

"Hmmm....... So we need to verify that you can control the weather, or that you're a psychopath who thinks he can control the weather."

"The horse is......! Do you want the horse to do that?"

"Well, I can see that you're definitely not in the right frame of mind in terms of losing your temper."

The way her anger flared up and then she couldn't even take a picture because she was so sorry for me, I knew she wasn't normal.

"Come with me, I think I need to check it out."

I take Riana's arm and lead her.

"If you can really control the weather, why don't you do it here?"

People will say the sky is falling.



* * *



It's also possible that Riana is mistaken.

The knot in my stomach manifested itself in the form of a storm, and the moment it was released, the weather cleared.

I'm sure if someone told me that, I'd introduce them to Airi. You're clearly mentally ill and need to get some counseling.

But it wasn't just anyone who said that, it was Liana de Granz.

In the original, Riana's abilities were specific to the Blitz, but as the story progressed, her abilities became more than just the Blitz itself.

It's now possible to stick a wing in dry air.

Thunderbolt.

A blast from the sky.

Soon the sky.

It's not out of the realm of possibility that Riana's abilities could evolve into weather-related abilities.

If Riana's ability has indeed evolved to cause weather changes, there's no telling how she might use it later.

But we need to check it out first.

Of course, you need to know that you can cause weather changes and to what extent.

Since we can't do this in Razak, we'll need to go somewhere off the beaten path.

"Deserted island?"

"Yeah, I need to check on something."

So, I took Riana to find Lucinil.



* * *



Since the Edina Archipelago is a collection of islands, there were many uninhabited islands in the first place.

One of the unnamed islands, which is quite a distance from the inhabited islands.

After getting information from the mermaids about the deserted island and confirming the coordinates, Lucinil cast Mass Teleport and traveled with them.

"It's a nice view."

In the first place, it's a place where the emerald waters shine.

In my Temple days, I used to come here for summer vacations.

The disconnect between this soothing landscape and the real work I have to do and what's happening on the continent is strange to me.

"But what are you going to do on a desert island?"

Lucinil tilted her head as if to say, "I'm here because you asked me to, but what are you going to do?

I look at Riana.

"I heard that Riana's superpowers might be more advanced, so I'm going to find out."

"More advanced?"

Lucinil shook his head, as if summoning a lightning bolt was already an impressive feat, and there was nothing more to be gained from it.

Yeah, I'm wondering about that too.

You've found a deserted island, but it's a sunny beach just like any other vacation spot.

"Let's do whatever it is."

At my words, Riana scratches her cheek in confusion.

"Well, you know what......."

"What is that?"

"No, I'm saying....... Before I told you....... you wouldn't have tried to do it yourself......."

a.

I think I know what the problem is.

"......I don't know how to use it?"

"......."

Riana has some awareness that her powers have improved, but she doesn't know how to use them yet. It's not impossible that it's actually just a coincidence.

"ugh......."

Riana concentrates on the shimmering emerald waters.

-Flash!

I could see hundreds of thunderbolts streaking across the sky and slamming into the ocean.

The flash of a thunderbolt piercing a very distant ocean.

And.

-Currrrrr!

Deafening thunder rumbled in my ears, staggered by time.

A thunderbolt in dry air, a few moments of concentration, and you've got hundreds of them.

The aggressiveness of Riana's abilities ranges from good to disastrous.

"This isn't it."

"......So."

Riana nods shakily at my words.

Awesome is awesome, but what you need to do is change the weather, not summon lightning.

"Something....... that feels like it can do something, but also feels like it can't....... It's a really weird feeling."

The origin and workings of psychic powers are unknown, even to the psychics themselves.

So Riana was in a state where she felt like she could do it, but she had no clue.

Lucinil is an archmage, but he doesn't know anything about psychic powers, so he just shakes his head.

-blink, blink, blink, blink!

In the end, Riana fought for a long time, sending thunderbolts into the sea.

It looked like it wanted to summon something other than lightning, but no matter how hard I tried, it wouldn't show up.

-Currrrrr!

It must have been twenty minutes or so.

"But, Archdemon."

"Yes, my lord."

"I know lightning strikes at sea level and nothing happens, but....... what if mermaids stick their heads out to see what's going on and get struck by lightning?"

"Uh, yeah?"

"......!"

Just in case.

A lightning strike in the ocean isn't going to kill the fish, but it might electrocute some mermaids who happen to stick their heads out.

Eventually, the three of us, including Riana, sat down on the beach.

"Just....... Was I mistaken......?"

Riana began to seriously consider that she might be a psychopath who believes she can cause weather changes.

Lucinil was understandably dumbfounded.

"But you know....... and when you could summon lightning......."

"Uh, ah....... Yeah."

With the death of her father, Riana is able to summon lightning.

And if Riana did indeed awaken a new power, it would be a new power triggered by some emotional state.

"So, if you're going to be able to wield a new power from some emotion......."

"So I just need to get into that emotional state?"

It was Lucinil, not Riana, who picked up where I left off.

"If a superpower is the ability to respond to emotions, then this time you were able to change the....... weather change, you should be in a similar state to what you were then, right?"

Lucinil says, smiling broadly.

"Then let's make it feel like that."

Me.......

By the way.

He must have been in a very bad mental state.

Isn't it painful to have to artificially put yourself in that state?

Riana's complexion turned an earthy color when she heard Lucinil's suggestion.

I wouldn't say I'm in a great state of mind right now, but I'm in a great state of mind on purpose.

You were probably feeling depressed or something not unlike that.

If you're in a situation like that, and you've caused the weather to change without realizing it, you're being depressed on purpose.

And to send Riana into a downward spiral of depression.

It's pretty easy when you think about it.

About five minutes of watching Riana grimace, unable to do this or that.

"Hey."

"......?"

"Help?"

Riana tilted her head at my offhand remark.

"You're helping....... What?"

"Enough details, help?"

Riana didn't seem to have a clue what I was talking about.

"If you can help....... would be great......."

"Um, yeah."

I grab Riana by the shoulders and look him in the eye.

"Don't take what I'm about to say the wrong way, I'm trying to help you. Okay?"

"Uh......? No, what the hell are you talking about......."

"It's all because of you."

Riana is broken.
