            Episode 521.





A kitten that appeared out of nowhere.

But the cat, who hadn't shown much interest in anyone except Adriana, seemed to take a great liking to Ellen.

"Ellen must be good."

Adelia, who had been watching Ellen and the cat, said as much.

"This cat hasn't eaten anything today, will he eat if Ellen gives it to him?"

Kono Lint's words made Ellen look over. When Ellen turned her head, there was a new, slightly lukewarm plate of milk.

"Why don't you give it to me?"

At Adelia's words, Ellen cautiously accepted the plate.

Ellen looks at the cat, which is staring at her.

Ellen doesn't know how to read a beast's expression.

But I get this weird feeling that he's reluctant, but he hasn't eaten anything, and I've even heard that he looks a little sick.

Ellen sets the plate down in front of the cat and nudges it toward her.

Squatting down, Ellen looks at the cat.

-.......

The cat looks at the plate, then at Ellen, and so on.

It's like they're watching you.

Eventually.

Finish.

Gearco.

The black kitten sticks its head in the saucer and starts licking the milk.

He refuses to drink milk no matter who offers it to him, but when Ellen offers it to him, he can't resist.

-Ohhhhh.

We all realized that Ellen is the kind of person who makes the impossible possible.

Ellen watched the black cat licking the milk with cloudy eyes.

Ellen began to slowly stroke the cat's back as it lapped up the milk.

Currently, the Alliance doesn't include only units directly affiliated with the Empire, otherwise it wouldn't be the Empire and not the Alliance.

This is humanity's greatest army, the sum of its parts.

Despite being outnumbered, the Archduke of the Duchy of St. Thuan and his wizards are at war, and the surviving empires have gathered all their forces and sent them to the Alliance.

It's no surprise that the most powerful of these empires, the First Kernstadt, sent the most troops after the Imperial Army.

It's a war for the fate of mankind, and we're off to war.

Cernstadt's troops, then, as the second most successful state after the Empire, must have been considerable in number and very important to the Allies.

Such was Heinrich von Schwarz, the youngest prince of Cernstadt.

Pyrokinesis, a combat-related superpower, is now comparable to Liana de Granz's thunderbolt.

Of course, Riana awakened her weather manipulation powers unbeknownst to them.

-Currrrrr!

Heinrich watched from his horse as the waves of fear burned the monsters.

The troops that had followed Heinrich watched the spectacle in disbelief.

Somehow, Ellen Artorius was able to tap into the true power of the fire elemental, but naturally, it was Heinrich who was more adept at using it.

The monsters on the ground were burned to ash by the waves of fear.

Next, Heinrich watches a swarm of flying monsters fly across the sky.

Just as there are many different ground monsters, there are also many different flying monsters.

However, flying monsters are everywhere, as they have more freedom of maneuver than ground monsters.

That's why no matter how much you clean up the area around you, you have to be vigilant and keep your eyes on the sky.

Watching the swarm of flying monsters fly by, Heinrich focuses his abilities.

"Brace for impact!"

At Heinrich's shout, the troops tensed.

All the troops saw a red flash in the sky, a single point of light.

-Flash!

Momentary oblivion.

-Crackle!

And with a deafening explosion that seemed to tear your eardrums apart.

Heinrich watched as the approaching flying monsters were thrown off balance by the shockwave and slammed to the ground.

Fire isn't the only weapon.

It's all in the power of Heinrich von Schwarz, including all the additional effects that flames can produce.



* * *



Every power is different, but any power that involved destruction and force, as was the case with Riana, was considered a very important power in the Alliance if the wielder was of a certain level.

Heinrich von Schwarz is a prime example, while other examples include psychics who can control the wind.

Redina's superpowers are also very important, albeit conditional.

Heinrich's abilities allow him to take on large-scale missions similar to Ellen's, and they often overlap.

As such, there have been quite a few occasions over the years where Heinrich has taken over for Ellen on joint missions or when Ellen Artorius is not feeling well.

So, from the Temple Royal class. That said, psychics have risen to prominence in the wake of the Gate, if not to Ellen's level, and are bound to have a significant presence within the Alliance.

After completing his color and annihilation missions, Heinrich returned to the garrison, receiving salutes from soldiers who recognized him one by one.

Not as much as Ellen.

Naturally, Heinrich can't be as famous as Ellen, who has two holy relics and is considered the Devil's arch-enemy.

-Prince.

-Prince!

-Prince, look at this!

However, whenever they passed through the Cernstadt garrison, Heinrich was treated as a hero alongside Ellen.

Heinrich waved to the soldiers who shouted for him to see them.

Even in the face of great tragedy, people will always find hope somewhere.

The youngest prince of Cernstadt, Heinrich von Schwarz, was seen as one such hope by the people of Cernstadt.

Whenever Heinrich sees people find hope in him, he feels a weight lifted from his heart, like a very heavy stone.

But the pressure was never something I hated.

"Heinrich, are you back?

"......."

Heinrich winced and muttered quietly as a voice seemed to pierce through his head.

Psychics all have their place. Even if it's a non-combat related ability.

The voice that pierced his head was the telepathic voice of Ivia, formerly B-7.

Ivia's abilities had now grown by leaps and bounds, and she was tasked with spreading the will of the Allied Command to the various units.

While not directly related to combat, it is perhaps the most important ability in warfare, as it allows for instant communication over long distances.

As such, Ivia is almost forced to live in the General Quarters rather than the Royal Class Barracks.

Technically, Ivia is the lone communicator in this massive army.

'Go to the Cernstadt command center barracks. The military commander of Cernstadt wants to see you.

"......Okay."

A voice like a direct punch to the brain.

No matter how many times he tried, Heinrich could never get used to it.

Telepathy.

Though not a force for attack and destruction.

I don't know if it's ever not a force for destruction.

The ability to interfere with someone's brain from a distance is probably the most dangerous superpower in the world.

Every time Heinrich connected with Ivia telepathically, he felt a strange sense of unease.



* * *



After debriefing the mission, Heinrich headed for the Cernstadt military garrison, just as Ivia had said.

Heinrich was almost as famous as Ellen in the Cernstadt military garrison, so much so that soldiers and knights saluted him with awe and respect whenever they saw him, even if he couldn't see them.

I couldn't answer every salute and cheer one by one, and now I'm on my way to the summons of the military commander of Cernstadt.

Heinrich quickened his pace and headed for the area of the military commander's barracks.

The garrison was vast, and Heinrich had to walk a long way to reach the barracks of the Cernstadt military commander on the hill.

The knights and guards guarding the area saw Heinrich, saluted him politely, and cleared the way.

Once inside the military commander's barracks, Heinrich soon saw a familiar face.

Two men sitting on the left and right.

"You're in the middle of another big operation. Good job."

A man with a serious expression.

"Isn't that a bit too much of a royalty roll, though? Isn't it okay for Empire royalty to be consumed? I think we need to protest."

A man with a disgruntled look on his face.

Both were older brothers of Heinrich.

"Stop, by that logic, there is no such thing as a good soldier."

"But my sister......."

"That's it. How long are you going to keep the youngest, the one you don't see much, parked here?"

And the woman sitting in the front row.

"There you are, youngest, have a seat."

The sharp-eyed woman glares at Heinrich.

"Yes, sister."

Heinrich, military commander of Cernstadt, first princess of Cernstadt and heir. He bows to Louise von Schwarz.

The youngest.

Sibling treatment.

Only after the world has come to this does Heinrich find himself treated as a brother by the brothers who had treated him as a stranger.

Louise von Schwarz, the eldest daughter.

The eldest son, German von Schwarz.

Second son, Alfons von Schwarz.

The Five Men, Heinrich von Schwarz.

All the brothers are in one place.



* * *



Seated at the head of the command circle, Heinrich slightly avoided the gaze of Louise von Schwarz. First Princess of Cernstadt and heir to the kingdom.

With the king unavailable, the military command of Cernstadt fell to his heir, Louise.

She is also the head of the Royal Knights of Cernstadt.

That means she's not only in command, but she's actually very good at it.

Heir to Cernstadt and head of the Royal Knights, plus Swordmaster at the age of twenty-four. Louise von Schwarz.

Heinrich was always afraid of his sister's piercing gaze.

Both of Heinrich's grandchildren graduated from the Royal Academy in Cernstadt a long time ago.

Louise von Schwarz was even an early graduate of the Royal Academy at the age of eighteen.

Just as the Gradias Empire has temples, Cernstadt has an academy system.

It was a royal undertaking that was expected to one day surpass the Temple and draw talent from all continents to the Royal Academy of Cernstadt. And indeed, the Royal Academy of Cernstadt was a prestigious educational system, if a little lacking in comparison to the Temple.

Heinrich's brothers were all admitted to and graduated from the Royal Academy of Cernstadt, not the Temple, because, of course, it would be untrustworthy to send royalty on royal business. It's the same reason why the Gradians entrusted the education of their royalty to the Temple.

But.

Heinrich von Schwarz was sent to the Temple, not the Royal Academy in Cernstadt.

That's not because Heinrich is an important person.

I just wanted to get it out of the way.

The brothers are all together, and Heinrich is the fifth, or sixth in number.

The fourth and fifth are not here.

No, not in the world.

Heinrich von Schwarz as a young man whose abilities had just been awakened.

They were burned to death by the panic Heinrich had caused.

That's why, when Heinrich was older, he went to the temple.

No, you've been kicked out of the temple.



* * *



"My sister....... You called me because......."

"There is no reason for brothers to gather, and since you are not in our army and we do not see each other, we have invited you to eat."

Louise said, and as instructed, the food soon began to arrive, one by one, on the tables in the command center barracks.

The siblings are seated at the table and begin to eat.

It's not a cozy scene, and there's not a lot of conversation going on.

But it's important that we're sitting here together.

Siblings.

Heinrich's heart raced at the words.

It had been a long time since Heinrich had been treated as a brother by his brothers.

I didn't get to go to the Royal Academy, where all the royals go, and I was pretty much abandoned at the temple.

Eight years old at the start of Temple's primary education.

At the age of eight, Heinrich went to the Temple in the name of education.

It was effectively an exile. The royal family of Cernstadt may have paid for his education, but they had no idea how Heinrich was doing or what he was doing.

Because I wasn't interested.

To the royal family, Heinrich was just a royal scion with the cursed power to kill two brothers.

It was a simple accident, and one that Heinrich was too young to remember.

An accident that happened too young.

A prince abandoned too young.

So, in fact, Heinrich is a stranger to his brothers, whom he has only been able to see more often now that he's become a significant figure in the post-Gate world.

No face, no attitude, no behavior.

Even his two older brothers, who ignored or hated him.

The big sister who was always chilly and now seems to be cold.

It was only when Heinrich had made his mark and become an important person that he was treated like family.

Abandoned royalty.

Only after Heinrich had become an important person, a person with a name and value in the name of power, at a time when humanity's reputation was on the line, could he be a brother again, albeit a reluctant one.

Heinrich had a tendency to overestimate himself.

I knew in my head that I was abandoned royalty, but I didn't accept it.

I am the Prince of Cernstadt. I am the next in line of the First Empire.

That was Heinrich's pride and joy.

Until some nutcase gets into Royal Class and grinds himself to a pulp not long afterward.

I know now that he's not actually a shitty beggar, but a demon with an extraordinary and alarming history, but it doesn't make any difference.

Hearing harsh words you've never heard before in your life, and even getting hit.

Making a fool of yourself in front of a classmate you had a crush on.

Heinrich realized he was weak.

You have a great background, but it doesn't really support you.

I had to recognize and accept that I wasn't really that different from a beggar, but that I was a lot worse.

Even the force that was given to me was not properly honed.

Heinrich tried to make it work.

To make the power we're given into something tangible.

Reinhardt goes from being a goofy classmate to a fearsome force to be reckoned with.

He definitely knows what he's talking about.

So after the Gate, even as he used his powers to kill monsters and save people, Heinrich continued to improve his abilities.

That's why Heinrich could be so important right now.

He was able to abandon himself and be treated as a brother again by his brothers who had treated him like a nobody.

In the past, Heinrich had a tendency to overestimate himself.

This is how Heinrich would have judged the situation.

My brothers finally recognize my value and accept me back into the family.

Once these things are done, I will be able to return to the palace and live as a member of the royal family, if not the heir to the kingdom.

You should have felt a sense of pride and accomplishment.

After being abandoned by his family, he would have been happy and content to return to that place for whatever reason.

However, there is no Heinrich from his arrogant, self-indulgent days.

Someone taught me how to do something called topic identification.

What you can and can't do.

Who I am.

What I need to do.

Heinrich is now able to look at himself and his surroundings quite dispassionately.

"When this is over, will you return to Cernstadt?"

Louise asks as she slices the meat.

In the past, I would have said yes.

He wants to be recognized by his siblings and parents for rebuilding the country.

I would have answered that.

But the other two siblings are bothered by their sister's question.

He intuited that the brothers were focused on his answer.

Return to Cernstadt.

I just miss the embrace of my family.

But what he will do when he returns to Cernstadt, what he will do to rebuild his country and recognize his brothers.

Think about the problems that come with being in a strong position.

The older sister is thinking about herself now.

How it would be understood, how it would be accepted, how it would be accepted that I was so innocently longing for the arms of my family.

Of what his brothers and countless others would think of him.

on how to view it.

Think about it.

The longing to return to the embrace of family, the many things that foolish naivety will bring.

Intuit that there will be people who are afraid of it.

Heinrich thinks his older sister is thinking of him.

"There's a lot going on in the world, so I'm going to be gone for a while....... I don't think I'll be back, and if I do, it'll be for a few days....... for a few days. If the Temple is rebuilt, I'll have to finish my studies. I don't know if that day will ever come, but......."

Heinrich felt the tension in the room soften at his answer.

"Yeah."

It's overwhelming to be recognized as a brother again.

A family that is forced to accept because of circumstance, because of fame, because of power, cannot truly be a family.

Heinrich von Schwarz had a realization.

"Well, that's a shame."

Louise looks at Heinrich and slices the meat and pops it into her mouth.

Know your topic.

A guy who is now cursed by the mere mention of his name.

The things I learned to do because of him were coming in handy in the wrong places.
