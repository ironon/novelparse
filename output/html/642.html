            Episode 642.





Scarlett had a double whammy with the devil and then surprised herself.

This was the first time Scarlett had ever sworn in her life.

So it was a bit of a surprise.

He said something he would never have said if it was the devil in front of him.

So you realize that you're thinking of the person in front of you as Reinhardt, not the Devil.

At first glance, Reinhardt hasn't changed much from his Temple days.

Other than being a bit more of an asshole, it seemed to be the same.

Of course, I was afraid of Reinhardt even in my Temple days.

Or, more accurately, it was a mixture of longing and fear.

But in the end, Scarlett couldn't figure it out.

In the end, in this moment.

Why me?

What did I say?

Just as Scarlett was confused by the disorganization of the situation, so was Reinhardt.

It was obvious to Scarlett that Reinhardt knew the situation was bizarre and that Scarlett was panicking.

All other emotions aside, Scarlett could clearly feel it.

That the devil is getting very impatient.

I keep looking out the window, trying to calm Scarlett down somehow.

"Okay....... No, it's not good, but ask me quickly. I know you won't believe me if I tell you anything, but I'll tell you as much as I can. I'll tell you anything and everything......."

"No."

Scarlett is panicking, and she's scared.

Scarlett takes a few deep breaths, slowly calming her panicked chest.

But I asked about the cat, because that's what I wanted to know, above all else.

But I didn't have to ask about the other issues.

"I said perverted and shameless, not that I don't trust you."

"......?"

I was confused, surprised, and scared.

But when it comes to believability, Scarlett is not a believer.

The day the gates opened.

Scarlett wasn't there.

But.

Elsewhere.

The dungeon where the demon was imprisoned.

"Sure, I remember."

Scarlett remembered clearly the way he'd spilled the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

Bertus took Scarlett with him to interrogate Reinhardt in case the demon used a spirit.

Neither the Emperor, nor Savior Tana, nor Scarlet believed every word of the demon at the time.

I hoped for peace.

I wanted to save everyone.

I knew the future.

All the words that sounded like the ramblings of a madman mumbling under his breath.

Even the devil, who used to say I made the world.

"I, for one, believe in you."

Scarlett clearly remembered.



* * *



Those who knew the truth were silent because they knew the truth.

Scarlett was one of those people who knew the truth, but dismissed it as nonsense at the time.

Except now, I know that that hollow, sad look in his eyes, like he'd lost everything, wasn't a front, it was the truth.

The devil even told me that if you don't trust me, kill yourself before everything goes wrong.

If we had done as the devil said and cut off the devil's head and hung it in the street, the gate incident would not have happened. We will never know.

But I know that if I had listened to the devil and let him go, the gate would not have happened.

I know that the despair and sadness I felt in the demon was not disguised, but was what it seemed.

Scarlett realizes that everything the Devil said was true, even if it seemed false at the time.

I know about Akasha.

But even if Scarlet believed the demon's words, there was nothing she could do about it.

I was there because the people who mattered needed me to be there.

And I'm one of those people who has remained silent because I know there's no point in telling people the truth after everything that's happened.

Scarlett did what she could.

I silently believed that killing monsters and saving people was the only way to go.

So Scarlett didn't say anything about the demon, she just did what she had to do.

It wasn't his place to tell people the truth.

Mourning and pitying the existence of demons.

He was just where he was supposed to be.

So Scarlett had no reason to ask about the gate situation in the first place.

Because you already know.

The Devil doesn't need to tell Scarlett that she won't be able to trust me.

Because you already believe it.

It's one thing to believe in the devil, it's another to fear him.

"Do you really think I'm here to get back at you......?"

"That....... Yes......."

Maybe he's here to get back at someone who didn't believe in me back then.

The Devil believes that the world is the way it is because people didn't trust him, so he may have a vendetta against those who didn't trust him, and Scarlett is one of them.

He suddenly realizes why Scarlett trusted him and yet trembled at the thought of being killed.

"Why would I do that, you had every right to not trust me at the time, and I don't blame you and I don't resent you."

"I see....... I see......."

Scarlett couldn't help but notice that he wasn't the least bit resentful as he scowled at her, asking why the hell would I kill you?

Reinhardt is still the same.

It's a demon, but it's not a demon.

It's just that they're still, well, people.

It's still baffling.

Despite what you believe, you're not an important person.

Why you're here.

Why are you asking me if I've seen my friends.

Reinhardt was stumped as to how to convince Scarlett, until he realized that he didn't need to convince her.

Scarlett was just too surprised. She just needed time to calm down.

I didn't have to tell the story. I've heard it all before.

Scarlett just needed time to calm down.

"Now that you've calmed down a bit, if you'd like to tell me slowly what's so urgent......."

"Wait."

Just as we're about to get down to business, Reinhardt's expression turns grim as he glances toward the window.

"Well, I don't think we have time to talk about it."

What the hell did he see, Reinhardt thought, and threw back the curtains roughly.

"Yes......?"

"I'm grateful and glad you trust me, but here's what we're going to do. I'll tell you all about it later."

Reinhardt stares into Scales' red eyes.

As if to say, never forget.

"From now on, you're never to be separated from me."

"Is that ......?"

Scarlett froze at the strange confession.

"Do you understand? Whatever happens, just stay with me. Just remember that, and if anyone tries to pull me away from you, don't let them. Do you understand?"

"What? Yes....... Oh, yeah. That......."

Trying to tear it apart?

Scarlett soon realized what Reinhardt's abrupt words meant.

-shut up!

Suddenly, Reinhardt is small.

-Angel

"......."

He was telling me to take myself with me wherever I went.

Believing is believing.

For some reason, he realizes that Reinhardt has come to him out of the blue, not to harm him, but to help him.

By the way.

Scarlett felt sick to her stomach at the sight of the black cat's piercing eyes juxtaposed with Reinhardt's grimy, dirty ones.

"I feel bad......."

-Hello!

I watched the cat paw at her front paws as if she was happy to do this, and Scarlett felt even worse.

And.

Soon.

-Smart

At the sound of someone knocking on her door, Scarlett felt every muscle in her body tense.

-Scarlett, it's me.

It was Ludwig's voice.



* * *



If cats have facial expressions, they must be looking very serious right now.

I rambled and rambled and didn't really get to the point of what we needed to talk about.

The devil has turned into a honey-eating cat and can't open his mouth anymore.

What's clear is that the demon has no intention of harming Scarlett, and Scarlett feels sorry for Reinhardt.

Why is the Devil here?

And.

Why is Ludwig here?

-Smart

-Scarlett? Can you open the door for me, please?

Scarlett felt a strange dread creep through her body.

It's clear that there were things going on that he didn't know about, in places he didn't know about.

Scarlett looks at the cat.

-nod

The cat nods, as if it's okay to open it.

-Dalcock

When I opened the door, there was Ludwig.

Ludwig still wears a bandage on his right arm, and his unruly hair has grown out of control.

There's Ludwig, somehow sharpened and much darkened.

"Ludwig......?"

"Oh, there it is."

Ludwig smiled thinly.

She hasn't been told what's going on. So Scarlett knows this is the moment to feign nonchalance.

"I thought you were gone again."

Scarlett feels uncomfortable with Ludwig's words.

They are superhumans whose senses are far more advanced than the average person's.

It's hard to imagine Ludwig not sensing the popularity on the other side of the wall.

"I was wondering if I should go out and look for it."

If he hadn't opened the door, Ludwig would have realized that he hadn't opened it on purpose while he was inside.

Somehow.

It only took Scarlett a few words to realize that Ludwig was telling a blatant lie.

For now, we need to feign nonchalance.

If you don't know what's going on and haven't heard anything, you should pretend you don't know anything.

You should pretend that nothing is happening.

"Is Ludwig....... back?"

"No, not really, but I'll be back soon."

Ludwig gestures outward with his head.

"It's a beautiful day, why don't we go for a walk?"

Ludwig's gentle smile would normally have made Scarlett say yes.

Ludwig may not be that close, but at the end of the day, everyone in the Temple Royal class is a comrade-in-arms.

The camaraderie of crossing the line of fire together is a far cry from ordinary friendship.

They're all incredibly valuable to each other.

You don't have to be intimate enough to know everything about each other, but you can die for each other.

Comradeship is such a strange form of friendship.

And Ludwig risked his life to save Scarlett's.

It cost Delphine her life, and Ludwig his right arm.

Of course, Scarlett saves Ludwig before that, but in the end, they owe each other their lives.

Because that's what comrades-in-arms are for.

I can't help but feel intimidated by this unknown.

"Sure. Great."

Scarlett, however, is dear to Ludwig's heart.

Just like you do with all your other friends.

Still, you can die for Ludwig.

So there's no reason you can't go for a walk.

"Uh, but wait a minute."

"Yes."

Scarlet still hadn't forgotten what the demon had said.

Ludwig watched Scarlett go into the room for a moment, and then emerge with her black cat in her arms, pacing from room to room.

"Ah....... You're here?"

Ludwig smirked at the black cat as if he hadn't seen her in a long time. Scarlet twitched the corner of her mouth, not wanting to give the wrong impression.

I know what I'm dealing with, and I'm feeling very gritty.

"Go, cat......? Go, live with, mountain.......? walk?"

Scarlett tries to say something to make it less awkward, but her tongue is tied.

-Cat!

Fortunately, Scarlett was interrupted by the piercing cry of a cat.

Ludwig didn't know, but Scarlett understood the meaning of the cry.

Shut up.

"Look at him, he only hangs out with girls."

Ludwig looks at the black cat with a meaningful smile.

-Accept

The black cat desperately avoided Ludwig's gaze.
