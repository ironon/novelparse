            Episode 329.





Zodiac took immediate action.

While the festival itself is over, temples that were supposed to be open until the end of the week immediately began controlling crowds, and measures were immediately imposed across the zodiac.

With the military in control of all the gates of the ecliptic, measures were being taken to restore order.

Of course, all of that was happening outside of the temple, so I only felt like the temple festivities ended a day early.

"It's quiet."

"Sure."

Ellen and I were walking around the temple, which was once again deserted.

Ellen is just Ellen, even if she was elected Miss Temple.

It wasn't much different than usual, and I didn't seem to pay much attention to it. If anything, it bothered me.

The festivities are over.

Now that the tournament is over, I'm sure I'll be able to enlighten the Emperor, but given the circumstances, I might not get that chance.

The issue of misappropriation of childcare subsidies will be addressed at a later date.

In the end, they didn't make it to the contest, but Ellen was crowned Miss Temple and Kliffman said she made the cut.

I don't know if it solved the confidence or human cringe issues.

It sounded like Riana was being berated by Ellen about how she got elected and you didn't.

Isn't this a case of not recovering from a bout of depression, but just having a new person in charge?

There's also Radia Schmidt's work.

Radia Schmidt is missing. She may be about to graduate, but Radia Schmidt is a no-limit tournament winner and still a Temple student.

The question of her disappearance will also soon become visible.

Elise, who had her, would take care of it, but Radia Schmidt was a member of an unnamed order. She would surely be a key witness in the case.

For now, we'll just have to hope she keeps it hidden.

Goro.

"It's a vacation."

"Right."

Winter break is here.

The imperial court will be in an uproar, but I've done what I had to do by killing Leviathan.

"What are you doing this vacation?"

Ellen looks at me and asks.

"Well, there's nowhere else to go, so he's probably at the temple."

It's a lot to do.

Negotiations with the Vampire Council.

Recontact with the Black Order.

Obtain information about Cantus Magna.

Determine Adriana's housing situation.

Contacts and actions against revolutionary forces.

It's not my job, but it's the job of the Magical Research Council.

If anything, I feel like I've been putting off things that I didn't get to do during the semester until after the break, so I can't really say, but I've been busier since the break.

Ellen walks still beside me.

"I'm going home."

"......home?"

"Yes, home."

Sure enough, Ellen's parents are alive and well. Since she hasn't been home all year, it seems like she's going home for winter break.

I didn't go into a lot of detail about Ellen's family situation or anything like that. She's not exactly a noble, she's a commoner.

The warrior Lagan Artorius grew up in an ordinary village, in an ordinary family, and became an adventurer.

So her sister, Ellen, is also a girl who grew up in an ordinary family in an ordinary town.

Ellen is always a soft-spoken person, but she never talks about her hometown. Of course, it's not that she doesn't want to talk about it, but it's more like she doesn't see a reason to.

I never asked in the first place.

I purposely don't ask because if I start asking, she'll ask, and then I'll have nothing to say.

By the way, if you're going home, are you going to stay back for the entire vacation because you're going to be with your family for the first time in a while?

"If I go to ......, when will it come?"

"I don't know."

He didn't seem to have any thoughts or plans other than to go home and spend time with his family.

Are you going to be back for the next school year after the break?

So how many months?

If I come back in March, I'll be gone from Temple for two months.

"......Why?"

I don't know what my expression was, but Ellen looked at me and shook her head.

"Can't wait to get here?"

No you don't!

You can do this by saying uh!

What's that thing that comes out of nowhere?

Are you sad to see me gone?

He stares at me with that look on his face.

You.......

You are the real.......

"......."

In the end, I said so, feeling like I'd rather die than suffer.

No.

If I don't see it for too long, I get worried.

Even if you're at home, you don't know people.

Isn't that right?

It's not that I'd miss him if he wasn't there.

Probably not....... Probably.

Ellen looks thoughtful for a moment, then shakes her head.

"You want to come with me then?"

"......?"

"My house. Do you want to come?"

I was momentarily interrupted by the words again.

Something like, if you think you're going to miss me while I'm gone, just come with me.

It's something.......

I'm not sure what's what with him and me anymore.......

I said I had nothing to do, so I'll go with you, but I don't really have anything to say.

Why I'd go there is beyond me, as I'm the one who walked into Arnaria without Heriot.

"Not if you don't want to."

Ellen walks away as if that's enough. She doesn't seem particularly upset or anything, but.......

Are you sure he's not angry? Because when he's angry, he talks out of his ass, and he doesn't seem to be.

By the way.

Ellen's parents.

They are also the parents of the warrior Lagan Artorius.

I'm curious.

I just made her a warrior and a warrior's sister, so I didn't have to explain what her parents were like.

I wonder if it's because of who their parents are that they're both monsters.

No, let's leave that behind and just use.......

I also wonder what kind of environment Ellen grew up in.

However, I had a lot of work to do this vacation.

I can't get away.

"......Sorry."

"Nothing to be sorry about."

There's no reason to feel bad about not being there.

Ellen shrugged, as if that was okay.

Adriana had been struggling for a few days.

Of course, that was a far cry from the plight of being held captive by a nameless order.

"Hey, do you need anything?"

"No....... It's okay, sis."

Reinhardt had dropped it, and now this mysterious organization boss was hovering over him.

"Heh. Yeah. If you need anything, just let me know, I'm always here."

The top floor of a building. It was her job to sit sprawled out on the couch in what she called her home office and do nothing. Adriana spent all day in the back room.

"By the way, if you give me the room, I'm going to....... Where is your sister sleeping....... Last time, on the floor......."

"Me? I don't really care about that stuff."

I didn't really use the room much in the first place, just stayed near the office.

Yesterday, Adriana freaked out when she went to the bathroom in the middle of the night.

He saw his boss, who had given him a room, sleeping on a stool on the floor of his office.

Give yourself a room and sleep on the floor.

He was so freaked out that when I told him he shouldn't be sleeping in this place, he scratched his belly and said, "This is how I sleep," and rolled over again.

He doesn't seem like a bad guy.

Being the kind of person who sees things as they happen, Adriana felt weird whenever Loyar was around.

"What are you doing?

"Aren't you bored?

"Want to go for a walk?

"Anything you want to eat?

"Are you comfortable?

If you're meditating in a room, they're going to be circling you and talking to you.

Adriana doesn't think it's a hassle.

Rather, it's more like a puppy, constantly circling around and asking questions.

Even though she knew it was rude to think about it, Adriana couldn't help but feel like a large dog was hovering around her, subtly cute in a way that made her feel weird whenever she saw her boss, who was always so lanky.

'I wonder what he's doing.......'

Adriana doesn't really know what she's doing here, and she doesn't know why the boss is the biggest asshole in the place.

Other people wear well-worn, if not expensive, clothes and wash them well.

This person is always sloppy, like an unwashed dog in the rain, with hair going everywhere.

Adriana lived in a monastery.

It's a life centered on self-discipline, self-care is a given, and I was very strict about cleanliness, not to mention keeping my surroundings clean.

Adriana, who has lived the life of a cloistered monk, realizes for the first time in her life that she has a strange compulsion for Loyar.

Regardless of who Loyard is.

Regardless of how scary he is.

It's a little overwhelming to see someone like that.

"I'm....... sister."

"Huh? Why? What?"

Adriana backed away from Loyar, a little squeamish, as he leaned in closer.

"That....... might want to wash up a bit......."

"Wash? Why?"

"That's, that's....... And it looks good doing that....... And it doesn't smell weird....... Don't you think......? Oh, no! I'm not saying you smell weird! I'm just saying....... I thought it might be good for your health......."

Loyaar shakes his head, then sniffs his arm.

"Do you smell that? Is that my body odor?"

"That, that can't be body odor......! Ew, ew."

It's a lie to say it doesn't smell.

Adriana pursed her lips, but that didn't mean she couldn't tell him he smelled like a rain-soaked dog.

Adriana takes a moment to think about what to say and how to say it.

"Then I'll just have to wash it."

Loyard said, "That'll do," and wandered off somewhere.

"......."

And when the gray-haired woman appeared, dripping water from her wet hair, Adriana stood still, staring at Loyar.

"I washed it. Do you still smell it?"

Apparently, it was just watered down.

He was even wearing the same raggedy clothes he'd just put on, and he was like, "I washed them, they're good to go.

Adriana felt like something important inside her had been shattered.

Adriana could somewhat understand why Reinhardt, at times, would lunge forward like a crazed lunatic without thinking things through.

So this is what it feels like.

-Pak!

"Huh?"

"Follow me."

Adriana began to drag a dazed-looking Loyar away.



* * *



-Wudangtang!

-Oh, I hate this smell!

-I mean, what if you don't like the smell of soap!

-Yuck! Don't put that on! It's slippery!

-Hold still!

The Rotary Club members all scratched their heads at the sounds coming from the shower.

"What is it?"

"You know, the girl Reinhard brought in the other day."

"Why is she?"

"She's washing her sister."

"Your sister?"

-Come here!

-No! No! I'm out!

-You're not going to get out of here naked, are you coming back soon?!

-Kudangtang!

Club members walking up and down the hallway had their mouths agape.

Someone is trying to force Irine's dogs to wash. From the sounds of it, someone inside is grabbing someone like a mouse, but it's not Adriana who's being held, it's the boss.

Their sister hates being bothered the most in the world, and she finds it very difficult to wash or change her clothes.

This is the person who splashes water on their face and claims to have washed it.

-Don't do it! Don't do it!

-Why don't you get over here?

Loyar is being washed by a woman who claims to be from the temple. Loyar tries to escape by squirming and making noises that sound like a dog being grabbed, but eventually he is grabbed and forced to grunt as he is being washed.

"I guess a temple is a temple after all."

"You're right. My sister can't move."

Everyone commented on what an interesting place the temple was.



* * *



Cleaning up after a mangy dog is a laborious task. Naturally, it's a lot of work for the person doing the washing.

Adriana's hair was soaked through, as were her clothes. Of course, Loyar, the washed party, had changed into new clothes, and Adriana was carefully towel drying his wet hair.

"Look, how nice it is to wash."

"......, right?"

Looking at his reflection in the mirror, Loyaar's face was grim.

After drying her scattered hair, Adriana ran a comb through Loyar's hair.

Loyar didn't know any better, and the feel of the comb gently scratching his scalp and hair was pleasant, so he leaned into Adriana's touch and closed his eyes.

Her gray hair was tangled and frizzy, but under Adriana's hands, it was transformed.

Of course, my hair wasn't shiny and silky, as it hadn't been maintained at all, but it didn't look like an unmanaged wild dog, either.

"In the future, you should wash your hands better."

"Uhhh....... I don't know."

Loyaar patted himself on the head.

"Brush my hair a little more."

"......."

Adriana ended up brushing my hair for a while longer.

The club members were stunned to see Loyar in human form for the first time.

-You're human.

-So be it.

"What are you talking about, you bastards!"

Everyone nodded in agreement that she was indeed human.

Tourists from all over the ecliptic were quickly exiting the ecliptic under control. In an orderly fashion, the sense of crisis hovering over the ecliptic remained, but the chaotic atmosphere was gradually subsiding.

The Imperial Household had to make an announcement to prevent rumors from spreading unchecked among the general populace.

Demons have appeared in the southern part of the ecliptic, slaughtering members of the Five Great Houses, including former Crusader Legionnaire Revere Lance, who were meeting in a nearby abandoned monastery.

It's unclear who the attacking demons are, and the imperial government is investigating the incident to the best of its ability.

It's an emergency, but don't be confused by the rumors about the devil.

To summarize the imperial announcement, it went something like this.

There was nothing particularly false about it. There was no reason to mix it up.

In a situation where a confrontation with the forces of the Five Great Houses could have resulted in a large-scale uprising, the demons turned their noses up at them instead.

The enmity of the Five Great Houses against the Empire turns to enmity against the demons.

I sat still, now, in a darkened underground channel.

With one bonfire lit.

-Jerbuck

Footsteps sounded in the distance and someone appeared.

It was Count Argon Ponteius who made his appearance.

Sarkegaard.

"Hey."

"Yes, degradation."

"Sit."

"Yes."

Sarkegar sat down across from me.

Soon after, Elise appeared out of thin air.

"And Radia?"

"I'm in my room. I'm not going to run away, rest assured."

Elise sat quietly to one side of the campfire.

I was about to call all my men to a place that used to be the home of the Rotary Club because we had some stories to tell.

When Loyar arrives, we can start talking.

I don't know how long I waited, but then I heard footsteps and someone appeared.

"......?"

"?"

"What is it?"

And when we saw who it was, all three of us could only shake our heads.

"......?"

We all looked puzzled, and the person who came to see us shook his head.

"Loyaar......?"

"I don't think so."

It's not like gray hair is common.

Loyar was right, but it was so out of character that all three of us were stumped.

Normally, Loyar is always a beggar, so when he gets close to me, I stay away from him, but now he's dressed and hair is in order.

No.

Did Loyar look like that?

Surprisingly, it's fine, right?

"Did you wash up?"

At Eleris's question, Loyaar nodded.

"Why not?"

"Why?"

Sarkeghar and Elise are horrified that she has bathed and changed.

Loyar.

What kind of life have you been living?

And why did you wash it?

It's already ridiculous to be surprised that someone would wash up.

Loyaar shuddered.

"The child you entrusted to me has been washed."

"......Adriana?"

"Yes."

It's also pretty weird to hear someone say with a straight face that they've been bathed.

Maybe he's actually a dog?
