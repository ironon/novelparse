            Episode 406.





Three days later.

I was in the Tetra, the central palace of Emperor Emperatos, observing a ceremony.

-One of the Five Lords, the great and pious Lord of Frostfire and the Lunar Operator who presides over the cosmic void. Apostle of Mensis, and kinsman of Ragan Artorius, savior of mankind and champion who slayed the evil Fado demon Valier. .......

The Pope of the Cult of Mensis, in a giant manifestation, chants incessantly at a kneeling girl.

Charlotte de Gradias standing in front of him in a dress and cape.

I watched, blending into the crowd of substitutes, as Ellen Artorius knelt before him, clad in a red cloak and dressed in conquest.

I didn't expect this to happen.

The engagement was never publicized, so that's it.

Instead of me becoming Charlotte's fianc√©, Ellen becomes an imperial knight who serves Charlotte as her lord.

This ensures Charlotte's safety.

Just as Ellen was being noticed, I was being noticed as the new owner of Alsbringer, invited to this ceremony.

But of course, Ellen was getting more attention than I was.

No wonder.

The secret identity of Lagan Artorius's sister was revealed at the same time she became the imperial guardian knight.

Even the many dignitaries in the room stared at Ellen in awe.

Among those watching the ceremony was the emperor himself, Bertus de Gradias.

Bertus and my gaze met for a moment.

He gives me a little shrug.

I didn't see this coming.

But Bertus was by no means displeased.

I'm on the side of the imperial family, even if I'm not engaged to Charlotte.

That's where Ellen Artorius was added.

For a would-be imperial master, this can't be a bad thing. There's also the possibility that Charlotte could become a dangerous competitor in the future, as you have the power to take her down at any time.

This spiraled into a situation where Charlotte was assured of her safety and Bertus was assured that the empire would benefit from the support of the two warriors.

It's one thing for a warrior to be an empire, it's quite another for a warrior to defend an empire.

The support of a vast populace would be added to the imperial cause, giving the empire a legitimacy that was already strong.

A warrior is a protector of humanity, and Lagan Artorius killed a demon to protect humanity.

And the warrior's sister defends the empire.

That's the kind of legitimacy that makes it safe to say that empire is humanity.

To be anti-imperial is to be anti-human.

Empire becomes ethics, and the emperor's word becomes morality, not law.

The imperial power, strengthened by the victory in the Demon War, faltered a bit, allowing a few demonic raids.

But the horrific figure of the Demon unites humanity, and the Empire's symbolism, representing the will of the people, is strengthened by the support of its warriors.

Empires need demons.

And Bertus needs a demon.

The Pope of the Order of Mensis reads the document in full, and Charlotte touches the silvery-white sword to Ellen's shoulder, once, and then again, lowering and raising it.

Ellen became Charlotte's Knight.

But important.

Demonology.

We need to find them quickly.

They might try to kill me, Olivia, or Ellen in the name of eliminating the demonic threat.

-twinkle-twinkle

Applause rang out as the Emperor realized that he had not been sworn in as a Plain Knight, but as an Imperial Guardian Knight.

With that.

I don't have to be engaged to Charlotte.

But.

This led the empire to reveal three important secrets to the world.

Reinhardt, champion of the Als.

Olivia Ranze, champion of Tuan.

And Ellen Artorius, sister of the warrior and apostle of Mensis.

Three beings will make a name for themselves across the continent.



* * *



Unsurprisingly, the temple was in an uproar.

Following in the footsteps of Alsbringer's master, word spread that a second-year Royal Class student was the younger sister of Ragan Artorius, the Savior of Mankind.

Even.

-You know, last year's Miss Temple, she's Mr. Artorius's sister!

-Really?!

-Somehow....... It didn't seem like a normal person.

-So.

With the added bonus of being a former Miss Temple, Ellen was bound to become an even bigger idol than Reinhardt.

-I thought you were the Empress's guardian knight?

-I guess you're both in the same Royal Class sophomore year.

-No, isn't he in the second grade, Mr. Reinhardt!

-Yes. That's right.

The whole temple was shaken up, and it was the same inside the Royal Class.

Herriot went white when he heard that Ellen had chosen Charlotte to be his mistress.

"Well, is that still....... still work?"

It was unthinkable before it happened, but after hearing the story of the Guardian Knight's ordination, Harriet understood why Ellen had made the decision.

"Why not?"

"Ellen....... It's going to be dangerous....... Obviously......."

Reinhard's work is important, but Ellen's work is important to Herriot.

Knowing this would put Ellen in danger, Harriet clutched Ellen's hand and sobbed.

Ellen held onto Harriet's hand and nodded, her expression steady.

"It's okay."

Ellen looks at Herriot.

"The Empire will protect me, Reinhardt will protect me, Riana will protect me, Adelia will protect me, and......."

Ellen looks at Harriet with trust in her eyes.

"You know you are."

There was never a hint of doubt in Ellen's eyes as she trusted everyone to protect her.

"......Yes. Ellen."

Herriot hugged Ellen tightly, and Ellen hugged him back.

Herriot already knew, but the reaction of his classmates was understandably one of horror.

"I'm sorry I kept it a secret, it was too big a secret."

"So......."

Liana and Adelia looked at Ellen and said.

"I'm still sorry, I could have told you."

"That's okay, but isn't it nice for a warrior to have a sister, even one this pretty and amazing?"

Riana was surprised, but not saddened, as if she were pleased. Adelia was puzzled as to why Ellen, whom she had always found a bit difficult to relate to, seemed so much bigger.

"What are you, that....... Artorius's....... brother?"

"Yes."

Olivia, who had been stopping by the temple from time to time, was also baffled by Ellen's identity.

"I ate ...... because I believe in everything."

"Well."

Olivia glared at Ellen, then clicked her tongue.

-Wrong!

"!"

"At least you're pretty this time, you cheap junior."

"Ugh! Ugh!"

Wrapped in Olivia's embrace, Ellen struggles against the force, but she can't break free of Olivia's grip.

Ellen could not help but know that her actions had played a crucial role in Reinhardt's decision to break off their engagement.

"......what are you doing?"

When she was finally released, Ellen gasped for air, her face flushed. Olivia tried to poke Ellen in the cheek, but with a shake of her head, Ellen dodged the gesture.

"They say the bear's got the talent and the bear's got the money. Hmmm."

Ellen was the one who declared herself a Guardian Knight, but Reinhardt claimed it as his own, and Olivia smirked and waved.

"I'm in a hurry, so I'll leave you to it, but think of something you want to eat, and I'll buy you a special meal!"

"No."

"Yeah, fuck off."

Olivia left the Hodadak Temple, wondering if she really had something to do. Ellen stared after her.

She'd heard that he worked as an inquisitor, but Ellen wasn't sure what exactly he did.

But the shadows cast by his backside looked a lot darker somehow, Ellen thought.

The reaction of everyone in the royal class was much different.

When it became known that the calm and accomplished sophomore was actually the owner of the ramen shop and Artorius's brother, the freshmen were not only shocked, but almost worshipful that there were two untouchable seniors in the sophomore class.

Of course.

Something very important also changed.

With the signing of the Guardian Knight, Ellen was a knight, albeit still a student. She was even a high-ranking knight, with considerable authority and power among knights, as the imperial guardian knight.

Of course, Ellen wasn't interested in any of that.

What mattered was the relationship between Ellen and Charlotte.

Ellen and Charlotte weren't always that close. They had a Reinhardt connection, but it was neither good nor bad.

However, the relationship between the two has been redefined as they are both guardian knights and lords of their own accord.

So, like it or not, the two have become a bit of a hierarchy.

"Ellen."

"Yes."

"You should call me Lord."

"It's a temple."

Ellen's statement that status is irrelevant in the temple, and therefore so are relationships with the gods, was, in some cases, correct.

But Charlotte opens her eyes and looks at Ellen.

"Are you going to call me Lord when you graduate?"

"Look."

Charlotte glares at Ellen at her blunt response.

"......."

"......."

Ellen has no loyalty to Charlotte.

If left unchecked, Reinhardt would be engaged to be married, and possibly even killed, so he reveals his identity and becomes a knight, hoping to gain greater fame and become dangerous instead.

Charlotte is no different.

He has little personal trust in Ellen, and feels that she is asking Reinhard to sacrifice too much, so he guiltily agrees to her request.

In other words, from a distance, the descendants of the warriors became a huge force in favor of the empire, but in reality, the relationship between the two was more like a chicken and egg.

To Ellen, Charlotte is the one who almost stole Reinhardt from her.

For Charlotte, Ellen is the one Reinhardt has the most heart for.

So.

Neither of us liked each other after what happened.

"Do you realize that I've made a lot of concessions, and don't you think you should be a little grateful?"

"I appreciate it, that's why it's your article."

Both Charlotte and Ellen have made some concessions.

Charlotte's decision to keep her mouth shut when she could have had Reinhardt was a concession, as was Ellen's decision to support the Empire by revealing herself as the sister of a warrior and risking demonic forces targeting her.

Charlotte had given up her future, and Ellen had chosen to defend the empire, even at the cost of her life.

So technically, they've exchanged rather than owed each other.

She may not be loyal to Ellen, but she is responsible.

As per her oath, Ellen had no loyalty to Charlotte, but if Charlotte was in danger, she would protect her with her life. She had no intention of abandoning her duties as a Guardian Knight.

Ellen and Charlotte stare at each other.

The two somehow became intertwined in a bizarre way.

This is where things came to a head, and we decided it was time to play some real games.

So, Charlotte kind of hates Ellen.

That goes for Ellen, too.

"You know you're a bit of an asshole, don't you?"

"You're a bit of a coward for coming all this way for a pitiful thing."

"Wow....... You're being mean, man. That's really bad, you!"

"You called me an asshole, so I thought I'd let you know what an asshole really is. I don't mean it."

"No, this shit is called a guardian knight......."

"Then get another article, minus Reinhardt."

"It's so annoying that Reinhardt and I were so close, and now we sound alike!"

"I guess we weren't close enough to even speak alike. Too bad."

"What, is this really....... Is this really......."

Charlotte and Ellen are bound together by their oaths as Guardian Knights, and they have grown to hate each other.

"Still, they're very grateful."

After grumbling, Ellen added, "I don't know.

"So, even if the rest of the world abandons you, I'll have your back."

He tells his lord that he has his own loyalties.

"...... leaves me speechless."

Charlotte, blushing slightly, turned away from Ellen and snapped.



* * *



Ellen becomes Charlotte's Knight.

The engagement had been broken off. I spoke with the Emperor separately about that as well.

The Emperor still wanted to engage and marry Charlotte, which meant he was free to do so. In fact, he seemed to be hoping for it.

Naturally, I took a step back and realized that I probably didn't need to, given the circumstances.

It's a ridiculous situation. That I have the power to choose in this situation.

The engagement never happened, but that choice made a very significant difference in the way Ellen, I, and Olivia were presented to the world.

And Ellen and I hadn't really talked about it yet. In a different sense than last time, I didn't know what to tell her, and she didn't seem to know how to make the first move.

So.

After the swordsmanship lesson with Savior Tana, she left, but Ellen and I sat side by side on a bench in the waiting room, saying nothing.

Neither of us left the room, but we felt like we needed to talk about something.

But neither of us knew how to begin.

The whole thank you and sorry thing is weird.

I made a choice, and it was Charlotte.

Ellen sacrificed herself to make that choice.

So it's a little weird to say thank you.

So it's kind of weird to say sorry.

"......."

"......."

So Ellen and I haven't spoken in the days since her knighthood. Ellen chose me because of me, but she hadn't talked to me at all.

How long has it been.

Until it's nighttime and darkness falls on the windows looking out of the waiting room.

We didn't get to talk about anything.

I had to say something, so I finally spoke up.

"I am......."

"Promise me one thing."

But before I could open my mouth to speak, Ellen cut me off and walked in. Ellen looks at me.

"Just like last time....... Like last time....... Like last time......."

Tears welled up in Ellen's eyes as she said something.

"Well, lying is....... don't......."

The lie, presumably, refers to what happened on the island of Kamsencha.

Was it a lie, Ellen asked, and I said yes.

Ellen sobs.

"I know it's a lie....... I know it's a lie....... Of course. I know...... but......."

"Too....... too......."

"It hurt so bad......."

Ellen cries and pleads with me.





I was going to sacrifice something, and Ellen was going to sacrifice herself.

But I ended up taking a certain amount of risk by revealing my identity to the world.

Before I could sacrifice anything more to protect Charlotte, Ellen intercepted it.

Both of us, to a certain extent, carried the burden of protecting Charlotte.

There's only one thing Ellen wants from me.

I'm not asking you to choose me, and I'm not asking you to like me.

Just like last time.

Don't destroy yourself with lies, that's all I'm asking.

I can't say I like it.

I can't even say thank you.

It's probably not something you can fix by saying sorry.

"I'm sorry."

That's all I could say.



* * *



Walking back to your dorm at night.

Ellen and I walked together with some distance between us. Guilt and obsession intertwined, and Ellen and I became a strange pair.

The engagement never happened, but even after Ellen told me about it, I was at a loss for words.

I can't go back to the way things were.

I wonder if I can just go back to normal and carry on as if nothing happened.

Do I deserve it?

Whatever I did, it didn't seem to work, so I was stuck doing nothing.

We walked back to our sophomore dorm in a daze.

I was about to go inside and rest, since it was night, when Ellen grabbed me by the collar. She looked at me, her usual nonchalant expression.

"Me, I'm hungry."

I said something like.

It was thrown out there like it was no big deal.

It was nothing.

Ellen would always say that casually, and after she said it, she would make something to eat.

A casual remark.

Soon.

Everyday words.

Now that the weirdness is over, let's get back to our normal lives.

Diligently clashing swords, overexerting themselves, and eating a lot of food before going to sleep.

Let's get back to those normal days.

Those simple words, Ellen's words of forgiveness, were a signal.

Let's go back to the way things were.

Let's live every moment together like it's nothing.

It's not that the guilt is gone, and it's not that something that's changed is back to normal.

However.

As if nothing has changed, as if you're not guilty of anything.

You can disguise it.

"Do you want anything to eat?"

"Stew. With beef."

"Okay. Let's eat."

"Do a lot."

"...... How much are you going to fuck up?"

How much do you want to eat.

Ellen was rather pleased to hear me say that.

"A lot, a lot."

Smiling, he said.
