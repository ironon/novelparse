It was actually a very traumatic and complicated moment.

However, Adriana's head turned white the moment she saw Reinhardt, regardless of all her other worries and circumstances.

All other thoughts flew out the window.

So, all I could do was run over and hug Reinhardt.

I heard somewhere that he was safe, and I know he showed up on the ecliptic.

I knew I was safe.

But the moment she saw him face to face, her uncontrollable relief overcame everything else and she couldn't help but hug him.

And.

Once the mind is a blank slate, it is gradually filled with thoughts.

I hugged him too hard.

And Reinhardt jumped up and hugged Adriana.

Well, that's good to hear.

"......."

"......."

After a while, it gets awkward.

It was as if they were siblings separated by war, and the hug was so intense that it became awkward.

If we use.......

Did it really have to come to this......?

It's tempting.

I was happy to see her and hugged her, but I didn't know when to pull away, so I hesitated, and then I gently unhooked my arm from Adriana's side first.

"Oh....... that......."

"Yeah....... Well."

They move away from each other, face to face, and subtly shy away.

Adriana couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation.

For some reason, I couldn't help but feel a stirring in the pit of my stomach.

I was a junior who was an asshole and said a lot of annoying things.

Again, this was the expression Adriana saw most often.

When I couldn't run, when I didn't know what a fight was.

This was the look I always got when that happened.

"Still the same, junior."

At that, Reinhardt snapped.

Like you're trying to force down an overwhelming emotion.

I know he's a demon, but in Adriana's eyes, Reinhardt was still the nerdy, overconfident junior who didn't know what he was doing.

On the topic of.

Later, he risked his life to save Adriana. I didn't realize it was Reinhardt until much later.

Later on, I became the protagonist of some terrifying things.

He's still synonymous with terrifying things, and the fact that he summoned himself through the Crusader Knights makes it clear that something is going on that Adriana can't see.

I still don't know what happened or how it happened.

But Adriana can't help but notice.

Junior.

Just that one word.

What the hell did I feel when I heard those words.

The corners of my eyes would turn bright red, and I'd watch as I forced myself to hold back something that was about to burst out.

Not the devil.

Temple's Reinhardt was who he was, and who he wanted to be.

You can't help but know that.

Otherwise, you wouldn't have that look of longing in your eyes at just that one word.

Adriana was so surprised, so happy, that she threw herself at Reinhardt and hugged him wildly.

This time, he gently cradled his junior's head.

"Hey, junior, that was tough."

"......."

The second hug held a different emotion than the first.

Worried and coddled, not welcoming.

More than she realizes, Adriana is special to the demon.

When you had something to hide, but no power.

Those days when you were really weak and couldn't do anything but have a bad temper.

Adriana before Ellen Artorius in the world.

He was the first to see her weakness, and the first to guide her.

Someone who didn't hesitate to take a person with a bad temper and a bad first impression by the hand and lead them.

That's why Adriana is so special to him, even more so than she realizes.

To the Devil, Adriana is the only one.

"Yes."

The Demon speaks while in Adriana's arms.

Adriana, the only one in the world.

"It was hard."

He was someone who could show his vulnerable side.

At that honest answer, Adriana choked back tears and realized that, while she was stronger than anyone else, she was actually weaker than anyone else.

That's why I hugged my broken and bruised junior harder and harder.



* * *



It wasn't a tearful reunion, but it was a near-tearful reunion.

Reinhard and Adriana sat side by side in the moonlit grass.

They're both a little more comfortable with the awkwardness now, but Reinhardt is stuck in a rut.

"Ummm....... I don't know, there's just so much to say that I can't say anything."

"Actually, so am I."

Adriana had exactly the same thoughts as Reinhardt and didn't know where to start.

Just as the devil has been through a lot, so has Adriana.

Of those, I'm just sad that I don't have a story to tell that I can laugh about.

"After all, there's a lot I don't know. I didn't even try to find out."

The leader of the Crusaders has become a man who moves at the behest of the Devil.

The possibilities are endless. Adriana couldn't help but wonder what Elion Bolton's sudden disappearance meant.

"Then Lord Bolton would be......."

"It's alive."

"Oh, I see....... Thank goodness."

Adriana breathed a sigh of relief.

Just as Adriana doesn't know Rowen, she doesn't know Elion Bolton.

Still, Adriana couldn't help but think that it was a good thing that someone was alive and not dead.

Watching Adriana breathe a sigh of relief, Reinhardt smiled bitterly.

"Although all five popes are dead."

"......?"

"I didn't kill him, but I told him to kill me."

"I see...... you mean......."

Adriana shook her head with a complicated expression.

The death of a pope is a very big deal. If it was publicized, there's no way Adriana wouldn't know about it.

The replacement of the Crusader Knights is still confusing, as is the unannounced death of the Popes.

Of course, the implication is that the entire top echelons of the Church are puppets doing Reinhardt's bidding, and that his control is so great that he can even cover up the deaths of popes.

I thought I was going through the motions, but Reinhardt ended up deciding someone's death.

Adriana knows that all of this was a tragedy that neither of them wanted to happen. But it's inevitable that they'll end up making decisions that will save or kill someone.

That made Adriana sad.

To Adriana, who thinks Elion Bolton is lucky to be alive, I'd kill for him.

It's telling you not to have any illusions.

Adriana didn't ask why.

It's painful to say, and it's painful to hear.

And naturally, there's one person who can't help but come to mind.

Irine's Hound.

Whoever was called that.

We hadn't known each other for long.

However, he became entangled with the Crusaders and the Cult of the Lord, was taken hostage, and then rescued.

With nowhere else to go, Reinhardt turned Adriana over to the Rotary Club.

And Adriana couldn't help but become very close to Loyar.

But the loyard was actually Lykanslov.

Lykanslof as he told Adriana to run away.

In the end, I couldn't help but think of Loya and the people in the Rotary Club who died saving Reinhardt.

They're all dead.

Loyar thought he was doing a good job of keeping his secret, but most of the club already knew he was a lycanthrope. Of course, they also secretly knew that Reinhardt was no ordinary man.

If any of them had opened their mouths, neither Loyard nor Reinhardt would have been safe.

Neither Reinhard nor Loya had any idea that they were keeping a secret, until they were all dead.

Loyar's name, too.

People in the Rotary Club.

Neither Adriana nor Reinhardt were talking to each other.

But the prolonged silence itself is enough to let them know what each other is thinking.

Neither of us ever came out and shared a sad story.

Now is the time to think about later.

"Will it all work out?"

It won't.

Adriana couldn't help but realize that there would be something else when the gate was over.

Demons and Empires.

What happens in between is already happening.

"I don't think so, as it's always been the case."

Reinhardt is not optimistic about the outlook.

"Still, I'm going to do what I can."

"......Yes."

Adriana looks at Reinhardt.

The junior, who was so far below him in everything, now found himself in a position of unfathomable strength and unfathomable power.

"Junior, am I stronger than I used to be?"

At Jimjit Adriana's scowl, Reinhardt smirked.

"I suppose so."

"Weapons are no longer swords, but hammers?"

To kill the monster, I picked up a giant hammer, not a sword.

Large hammers that the average person can't even lift properly.

I've smashed a lot of monsters with it, not slashed them.

At that, Reinhardt nods.

"I know."

"......Huh? How do you know?"

"Gee, I've been watching......."

Reinhardt didn't know whether to say something or not, and finally sighed heavily, as if giving up.

"Cat. Remember?"

"......cat?"

Adriana shook her head at the offhand remark.

If you say cat in this place.

There's only one.

Adriana's eyes widen as she realizes something.

"Oh, no."

"That was me."

"......."

Adriana's jaw dropped at the shocking story.

A black kitten that appeared out of nowhere.

When it seems to disappear, it reappears, and when it seems to stay for a while, it disappears again.

And in the end, the black cat that Ellen took to the temple.

"Honestly, it's like a dog....... Not like a dog, but whatever. Yeah, admit it, it's pervy. I know, I know, but......."

"Somehow."

Reinhardt starts to excuse himself, but Adriana interrupts him.

Reinhard stares at Adriana for a moment.

Adriana laughs, even though it's a pretty bizarre story.

Laughing, he pinches Reinhardt's cheek.

"For some reason, that cat only really likes me and Ellen."

Oddly enough, the kitten was unusually compliant with Ellen and Adriana.

She'll sit on Adriana's lap and eat jerky, and she doesn't resist when Ellen takes her to her room.

It certainly did.

If it was Reinhardt, it makes sense that the cat would behave the way it did.

That fact speaks volumes.

The cat's behavior shows that Reinhardt hasn't changed.

He still liked Ellen and cared about her, so he'd come to see her like that.

And.

She was not only well behaved in front of Ellen, but also in front of Adriana.

"Well, junior, Ellen is Ellen, but....... I've missed you a lot too, haven't I?"

"......."

Reinhardt blanches at Adriana's words. No, the Demon, a being so high up that it's hard to look at him anymore, blushes.

He's embarrassed to have been found out and doesn't know what to do.

After all, at this point, I'm still here because I want to talk to Adriana.

"You're so cute."

"Uh, what can I say......."

Unable to bear the sight of her blushing junior, Adriana giggled for the first time in a long time.

I laughed and then surprised myself.

I couldn't remember how long it had been since I'd laughed so hard.

As soon as I realize that there was a time when I could have laughed like this, I'm forced to calm down again.

"So, no particular reason?"

"Why?"

"Okay, if you have a point, I think you should probably get out of here, because I don't see one."

We hugged a little too hard, thought about what we shouldn't say, and talked a little.

So if he had something to say, he'd better get out of there, but Reinhardt didn't have much to say about it.

"Technically, it was for no reason at all."

"Hmm?"

Reinhard looks at Adriana.

"After Gate, everything I do has a reason."

"......."

"In other words, they didn't do it because they wanted to."

Because we need something.

Because we need to be strong.

Because we need allies.

I need information.

I want some kind of power over someone.

To prevent any disaster.

To prevent someone from dying.

Or, to kill someone.

It was all for a good reason.

It was more of a necessity than a reason.

What to do as a demon.

It was a time when you moved toward a goal that you knew you had to accomplish in order to get where you wanted to go.

Even what happened with Ellen was necessary in the end, because you can only predict what's going to happen next if you know what's going on with the warrior.

But.

I didn't have to meet Adriana or anything.

"Before it's all said and done, just. Something you do because you want to. There's no need, there's no reason, but there's at least one thing that you just want to do....... I wanted to do."

"......."

Adriana gave a faint smile at that.

It's been a while since I've seen you.

Wanting to do something that was just that for once, the demon sought out Adriana.

"Is that what you were coming to see me about?"

"......Is something wrong?"

"Weird, thanks I."

Suddenly, Adriana stretches, reaching for the sky.

"But I feel a little bit, well, miserable, because I'm being told this because I'm not really worth using."

"......No, that's not it."

"Why, you do realize that I don't have much influence, that it doesn't really matter if I'm on your side or not, that meeting with me is a waste of time on your part, that I'm just a nice way of saying that I'm weaker than you now. Do you think I'm stupid?"

"......."

At the end of the day, Adriana isn't very relevant to the mainstream.

They're much stronger than the average person, but they're infinitely weaker than the people who ultimately decide the big story.

No power, no strength.

So the demon didn't have to take the time to find Adriana.

Other people to watch are worth watching in their own right, but not Adriana.

Adriana is someone you don't need to use.

"Thanks for packing it so well, though, junior. That you wanted to come for personal reasons. I'm glad."

"......."

In the end, it's the same thing, but it depends on how you look at it.

You could call it a waste of time.

However, it's also possible to say that you've left something big behind and found someone you really want to see.

Adriana couldn't help but be pleased that she was the only one who found it for personal reasons.

Reinhard stares at Adriana.

"Actually, I was scared."

"......Scary? What?"

Just as Adriana looked at Reinhardt and thought it was the same old, same old.

Adriana's demeanor makes the demon think he's back to his old ways.

"I was scared that you had changed."

"......a."

"You've changed, everyone."

That's why I hadn't seen Adriana until now, because her attitude and outlook might have changed.

Some people have gone to extremes, because it's weird not to change.

She's the only one who can remember and reminisce about the past, and when she sees him again, she can curse him for making the world the way it is.

The devil says that he was afraid of it.

Not death, or anything else.

He says he was afraid that Adriana would see him and make a face and curse him.

"That's all you were afraid of."

"......."

"You're scared to death of something as simple as......."

Adriana bowed her head and wiped the tears from her eyes.

The devil doesn't cry.

You can only tell them about your fears with a straight face and that you were afraid of them.

Like you're going to throw away all your weaknesses today.

Tell them your fears that you haven't told anyone.

"I didn't have a use for it."

"Yes."

"Well, now that I've seen you in person."

"For......?"

Reinhardt looks at Adriana, who says she's here for a reason, and wonders what's been on her mind as they've been talking.

"You're out of this."

"......?"

"Stop fighting."

Adriana's eyes widened at the absurdity of it all.

"Go back to the ecliptic, or follow me, because I'll do the other stuff, and they'll do the other stuff."

Now, there's only one fight left in the Gate debacle.

So don't fight the final battle, and the devil will come to life when he sees Adriana.

"Junior."

Adriana's expression hardened.

"Are you asking me to be a coward?"

"Yes."

They don't say it out of cowardice, or for other reasons.

You might survive the final fight, but you might die.

Run away cowardly and live.

The demon has no intention of using Adriana, but he does so because he wants her to survive.

"My power may be weak, junior, weaker than yours, weaker than all the other strong people out there, and it won't mean much."

"......."

"Still, it's not like I don't want to do something."

The desire to save someone.

Wanting to be of some help.

The size of your power is not proportional to the size of your heart.

The demon bites his lip at Adriana's words.

Everyone has their own resolutions.

It is arrogance to try to defeat it for your own greed.

Adriana wants to fight, but I have to pull her off the battlefield because it's dangerous.

"But I can do more than one person's share."

"......."

Reinhard could not force Adriana anymore.

It was already selfish enough to say that you were afraid of someone's death and wanted them to be left out.

You don't want him to leave, but you can't force him to leave.

But like something is unbearable.

Adriana could read enough in his expression to know that he wanted to do it, even if it was by force.

"I promise."

"......what?"

"Promise me you'll survive."

In front of a junior who said it with a sad face.

"So, who am I?"

Adriana laughed, and echoed the words that the mean junior sometimes said.
