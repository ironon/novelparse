"I think those bodies got out as the undead, that's our conclusion, but what the Empire does is they take them and they regenerate them in those....... and reanimate them in these giant vats."

"Right."

"Then....... that what happened there had nothing to do with the Empire in the first place....... I think, but....... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to confuse you, I just thought maybe that's what happened......."

"No, you're right."

Ellen shook her head firmly when Ludwig tried to cloud her words.

"I don't need to ask Bertus to know that. It's clearly a different case, and there's no reason for the Empire to steal the graves of the Crusaders."

Crusader Grave Robbing.

And swapping bodies in a national cemetery.

That's a different case.

They work too differently, and the Empire has no reason to touch the Crusader Graveyard in the first place.

"So Rowen was investigating the wrong guy in the first place."

But it's just another labyrinth.

It's all the Empire's doing, but they didn't kill Rowen, and they had nothing to do with the theft from the Crusader catacombs.

Rowen then approaches Ludwig to go after the wrong guy.

Of course, there were enough similarities in the scene to make me think it was the work of the Empire.

However, they are technically two different events.

So who are the people behind the underground?

Did they kill Rowen?

"Now I really don't know what....... I have no idea."

Heinrich began to rack his brains.

"We don't have to think about this anymore. We're not obligated to reveal the truth."

Ellen said.

"I also wanted to find out why this archbishop named Rowen had approached Ludwig, and if he had any intention of killing me, but some things became clear: Rowen had approached Ludwig, and the reason was to investigate the Temple."

Not all questions are unanswered, so it's okay to let the case go with only unanswered questions.

It's not even an unjust death, as we learn that Rowen was involved in a lot of bad things; she literally did enough to deserve to die.

Karma, or should I say retribution.

If someone had retaliated against Rowen, it would have been what she deserved.

Ludwig mumbles to himself.

"Yeah, I guess I don't need to know everything......."

The truth you already know. The truth you know is overwhelming. Just enduring what's already happening is overwhelming.

It's painful enough to have to remain silent about something that's clearly wrong because it's real.

I don't think it's possible to dig any deeper into Rowen's work here, which is now completely lost.

"But when you give up, do it anyway. There's one last possible place."

Ellen says it's okay to let go, but she looks at everyone as if this is the last time she'll ever do it.

"The Crusader said that if the popes are trying to hide something from you, you can't know it."

"......Yes."

"And it's also true that the Crusader Master was hiding something from me."

Ellen says still.

"We need to find out what they're hiding, and even if they're not, the Crusaders are investigating this on their own. If they find anything, they might be willing to share it with us. If we don't get anything there, let's end this here."

The last ones to go.

Once again, to the Crusader Knightmaster.

And the Popes of the Five Great Houses.

We don't know if the truth they have has anything to do with Rowen's murder.

However, if I couldn't get anything out of it, it was time to dust myself off.



* * *



The case is a quagmire.

Unless the Empire, the most likely suspect, did this, the only other possibility is the pagans. But figuring out which one of them is the culprit is near impossible.

That's why Ellen decided to visit the Crusaders one last time.

But it was a sensitive issue.

'Commander, you can now visit....... It's okay if you stop helping him, you might get in trouble.'

That's why Ellen told Louise that she didn't need to get involved anymore.

'What's the point of that now? I'm coming.'

Having already learned too much about what not to know, Louise realized that she, too, must come to an end.

Whatever the secrets of the Crusaders are, they are greater than those of the Empire.

Once again, four people left the temple.

The four of you walked the length of the halted magic train to the Great Hall of the Crusaders.

"The director is out of the office."

With those simple words, the paladins guarding the main gate blocked Ellen's path.

"Then I'll wait inside until you get back."

"You're going to be gone for quite a while, so you won't be back anytime soon."

"......."

Ellen glares at the paladins guarding the entrance.

The attitude is odd for some reason.

I was also blocked when I tried to enter the burned temple. I could tell he was really troubled.

But for now, something.

It's a little weird.

"Are you saying you went back to the Allied garrison?"

"......Yes."

That's a lie.

There is no way that Elayon Bolton would have returned to the Alliance garrison without properly finalizing the events of the current ecliptic.

The gatekeeper is lying now, because he wouldn't have returned without knowing what was going on in the zodiac.

But why tell such a blatant lie?

And.

Ellen looks at her surroundings, not at the paladin in front of her.

The paladins guarding the gate all have their eyes on Ellen.

Ellen and the gang.

Ellen takes a step toward the paladin.

"......!"

As Ellen approaches, he takes a step back.

A slightly different look than last time.

"Why is it falling like this?"

Despite his armor, the corners of his eyes, his face, and his fingertips were trembling.

It looked terrified.

Why?

"You don't have to come back right away. I'm going to go inside, and if you're not there, I'll find someone who is."

The moment Ellen tried to pass.

"You're not allowed in."

"......."

The terrified paladin blocked Ellen with his body.

I don't know what happened, but this cleared it up for me.

The absence of a Templar isn't the point.

It's important that we don't let Ellen in.

"Get out of the way."

"...... is not allowed."

It wasn't just the paladin in front of her, but the other paladins as well, and Ellen could feel the tension in the air.

As the mood begins to turn sour, so do the expressions on the other three faces in the back as they wait for Ellen to finish her story.

"Maybe I'm in the right place."

Ellen shakes her head, looking at the terrified paladin.

"You want to see if I can force my way through. If you want to know, try blocking it one more time."

Ellen takes another step toward the entrance of the Great Hall.

This time, the gatekeepers were unable to stop Ellen in her tracks.



* * *



Ellen entered the battlefield instead.

The paladins who hadn't stopped Ellen stared at her back, their faces grim.

"...... That's weird."

Instead, it was a very strange sight.

Obviously, I came in with the idea that there was something there.

"Is anyone....... Why isn't he there?"

When I stopped by a few days ago, there were a lot of paladins and priests roaming around.

But now there was silence, with no one coming or going.

It can be incredibly disconcerting to be in an overly large space and not hear any sound.

Everyone was feeling that awkwardness.

"Something's going on."

"Let's go up."

The Crusaders' Great Hall, which seems to be nearly empty.

Ellen led the group up the stairs, if only to confirm the absence of the crusader leader.

My heart was beating in a strange rhythm.

What happens.

No, it happened.

Instead, the battlefield was empty.

It's as if you're trying to bite someone on purpose.

Soon, Ellen's quest to reach the upper levels, where the Crusader Knights' offices were located, was cut short.

-Pooh! Pow!

That's because I started hearing an eerie beeping sound.

"What......?"

The sound of something sharp tearing and cutting flesh.

-Thump! Thump!

The sound of something hitting a wall.

It was loud enough for Ellen, whose senses were far more acute than the average person's, to hear, as well as for the others.

It was so quiet in the room that the sound echoed even more clearly.

Ellen ran straight to where she heard it.

Close to the crusader leader's office.

Conference Room.

The sound was coming from there.

-Bang!

Without hesitation, Ellen kicked in the closed conference room door.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw what was happening in front of me.

Someone was killing people.

Ellen looks at the blood and dead people in the room.

Their flesh was strewn about, unrecognizable from how they had been torn and slashed.

The huge conference room was a pool of blood.

The person behind you slowly turns his head.

"No one told me to come this way......."

He turns around, sees Ellen, and twists his mouth into a grotesque grin.

"This would have been unstoppable."

"What....... What is this......?"

As Ellen froze and muttered, others arrived.

"Uh......?"

Ludwig could not help but be mesmerized by the scene of carnage and the man who seemed to be the master of it.

"Priest......?"

"Ah, Ludwig......."

She wipes the bridge of her nose with the back of her hand, holding the small sword in a reverse grip.

He tries to wipe the blood away, but it's a bizarre sight, with more blood smeared on his face.

"I see, Ludwig doesn't know anything......."

The look of regret on his face was palpable.

But the look of pure apology on his face, as opposed to the blood all over his body, only made him look more eerie.

"How did the priest......?"

Ludwig's reaction made it clear who the woman in front of him was.

Archbishop Rowen is alive.

A supposedly dead priest is on a killing spree in the great hall on the top floor of the Crusader Order.

And the paladins blocking the way at the entrance.

Empty substitution.

You can probably guess that this is not an isolated incident.

There was some collusion.

A conspiracy so big it's hard to fathom.

And dead people.

The clothes of the murdered, unrecognizable.

"You, who did you kill?"

At Ellen's question, Rowen shrugs.

"The popes."

The dead totaled five.

That was enough for Ellen to guess what was going on.

"By the way, have you guys seen Elion Bolton?"

"......what?"

"Where and how I smelled it. Because he ran away."

The crusader leader was not lying when he said he was out of town.

It's everyone's first time seeing Rowen in person except Ludwig.

"If you don't know, can you please stop interfering and get lost?"

"......what?"

"It's rude to stick your nose in other people's business."

I don't even know where things started anymore.

The priest who was said to be dead is alive.

For some reason, the priest is slaughtering five popes.

It's almost as if everyone in the room has moved out of the way.

Where.

What.

How did we get to this point?

Should I draw my sword?

Ellen's eyes were wide and her fingertips were shaking.

"I don't like that crazy bitch either, but I think we should leave her alone for now."

Suddenly, I heard a voice behind me, and I couldn't help but turn my attention to the hallway this time.

"It's all well and good for you to be all over the place, but why don't you back off?"

All four were even more aghast at the sudden appearance of the man.

"Olivia...... lanche?"

One of the three Temple students who disappeared with the Devil.

Olivia Ranze was looking at them.

Not Heinrich, not Ludwig, not Ruiz.

I was horrified, knowing that she should never have been in this position.

"I'll make it short."

Olivia looks at them, arms crossed, whether they realize she's there or not.

"From now on, the Crusader Knights and the Order of the Five Great Masters are ours. Well...... technically, we're just getting back on track."

"What did you say......?"

"So, go home thinking that's it."

Olivia was looking exactly at Ellen.

"You're smart, you know that if you start pulling knives around here, things are going to get weird, right?"

In the face of such an arrogant and imposing threat, Ellen felt like giving up on understanding the situation.





第613季节





Elayon Bolton waited at the warp spot for his spacewalk.

The popes knew that the Devil's following was growing, and Elayon Bolton was surely sensing the tide, if not the details.

But that wasn't the point.

The Cult of the Eclipse had already been mobilized by the Demon King's followers, and it was clear that Rowen was a key figure.

But it's only the Cult of the Eclipse that has fallen for it.

Allies.

The paladins and priests under the constant command of Elayon Bolton could support the Demon King, but they could not be controlled by Rowen.

A bond that has crossed battlefields and lines of fire together countless times is not something that can be betrayed easily.

As such, the Cult of the Zodiac forces are literally a handful compared to the paladins and priests of the Alliance.

While the Crusader Templar may have a lower actual rank than the Pope, he has a great deal of authority and power.

And that's just what Rowen has gotten his hands on.

The Crusaders were, and still are, capable of staging coups whenever they feel like it.

If he returns to the Allied lines with a large army of paladins, Elayon Bolton has enough troops to push back the unholy forces of the Eclipse.

Elayon Bolton was a madman who sought to execute the head of his enemies in the middle of the enemy's territory.

The most elite paladins who carried out the order were men of Elayon Bolton, but even they were slain by Rowen.

You have been grossly underestimating Rowen's combat power. It's clear that he's been hiding his true strength.

Elayon Bolton would pick and choose from those who remained, and those who were not captured by Rowen, under his breath, and Elayon Bolton would return to the Allied garrison.

The power of the Cult of the Zodiac is already beyond the control of the Popes and the Crusaders.

We don't know what we're going to do, but we need to get back to the Allied lines and think about it.

I've been back to a few places I thought I was home, so for now, I need to get my thoughts together while I'm safe.

"Forward to....... What the hell is going on?"

"I don't know."

I'm also outraged that the popes handed over the entire Church to the devil, and they weren't even the ones making the decisions about the Church in the first place.

And he was tasking Rowen's people to track her down.

The ecliptic is dangerous.

You need to leave.

That's why Elayon Bolton was at the warp spot, waiting for the mass teleportation spell to activate to take him back to the Alliance.

"When we get back, we'll go straight to the center. There's no guarantee Rowen hasn't tried his tricks there, too. We'll do the verification, and then we'll figure out how to handle this......."

You've ruined everything.

Elion Boulton felt like biting his tongue at the thought of breaking everything.

Go back.

Just go back, and then.

What's next?

Get it wrong and you could start a civil war.

It's not a small place.

The paladins and priests of the Alliance follow their crusader leader more than the Pope. There are some who support the Demon King, but it is only out of sympathy; they truly follow the man they have fought alongside, Elayon Bolton. As such, they have no choice but to side with him.

Now, Elion Bolton is a commander who has abandoned his army and gone into enemy territory.

If he can get back on track, if he can bring his army with him, control of the situation is in Elion Bolton's hands.

I had no intention of overstepping the authority of the popes.

But if the authority of the popes has become worthless, it's a problem that shouldn't go unaddressed.

It means that the Church of the Lord has completely ceased to function as an organization.

The fact that the Church of God has been privatized by a single entity is itself a problem.

If it was the choice of the chiefs to negotiate and coexist with the demons, I would respect that. There was no reason to disagree.

However, if someone other than the head of the Order is already in control of the Order, the Order should not exist that way.

The popes were incompetent.

Also, Elion Bolton was incompetent.

You think you're reading the signs, but you're looking up at the signs.

Empires, demons, and emperors.

I was thinking about those things and not really looking at the changes that were happening underneath.

I thought the movement from below might touch on a big problem, but I didn't realize that the movement from below was already a big problem.

I don't know where to start, but I'm going back.

The popes were incompetent beyond incompetent.

But Elion Bolton knows he's not incompetent, even though he's painfully aware of it.

A vast army of paladins and priests are still under his control.

After returning home, you must do something about the ruined Church of the Lord.

You should be able to decide what to do next.

"When we get back, we're going straight to headquarters."

"Yes, sir."

Elayon Bolton is nervous and anxious that his return could be the beginning of a massive civil war.

Will he go along with it, what will happen to his bond with the demon, and what will happen to Rowen.

There was so much at stake in his hands.

How long have I been waiting.

-Flash!

With a flash, Mass Teleport was cast.

With the fading of his vision, Elayon Bolton opened his closed eyes.

"......."

And as soon as Elion Bolton saw what was in front of him, it all clicked.

Since you traveled from a warp spot, you should have traveled directly to the warp spot of the Allied garrison.

But.

Elion Bolton has arrived in an unnamed forest.

And none of the people he was with were with him.

But he wasn't alone.

There were two people in front of me.

On a tree stump, a demon sat.

"I thought you were going to call it Intercept....... Well, it's a feature, I just experienced it, okay?"

And by his side was a girl with forked hair.

"This is ......."

Daughter of the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan.

Herriot de Saint-Ouen, the greatest genius in the history of magic, was at the Devil's side.

"I went to....... in the first place in the first place."

When Elion Bolton dies, civil war breaks out.

There was no way that what the Crusader leader knew, the others didn't know.

"This is so....... We were supposed to hold hands, but now we have to face each other like this."

Yesterday's enemy is today's friend.

Yesterday, we were supposed to be friends, but today we're enemies again.

Around and around we went, and that was that.



* * *



What happens when Elayon Bolton returns to the Allied garrison.

It was inevitable that something like this would happen, as I knew I had to be on the lookout for it. The moment Elion Bolton disappeared in the first place, it was only natural that he would try to return to the garrison.

"I wasn't going to kill any of you originally."

The Devil says, still.

"You know, there's no point in changing popes or crusaders, it's just a pain in the ass."

"I like the status quo. I like it more than you do."

"Of course, I don't want the gate situation to stay the way it is."

"So without much change, the Crusaders are the way they are, the Popes are the way they are. Let's just keep it rolling and stay out of each other's way. No more bloodshed. That's what I was thinking. So I wasn't going to kill them, I wasn't going to change them."

"But if we don't change it, something even worse might happen."

"And you were up to no good and didn't tell me about it?"

"I know it's hard for us to be full allies or superiors, but I heard that the popes wanted to kill all the infidels."

"I was willing to be taken advantage of, but you didn't say you were going to let me crush your liver because it's stuck to your gallbladder, or remove your gallbladder because it's stuck to your liver."

Elayon Bolton's eyes widened at the demon's words.

"Yeah, you wouldn't have known, it was the idea of the popes, and you were too busy killing monsters to think about it."

"Thank you for saving me from making lame excuses."

"I'm not going to say it's your fault for not knowing, because it's not really your fault."

For Elion Bolton, the war was hard enough.

Elion Bolton was too far away from the ecliptic to know what was going on, what the popes were thinking, and what was going on inside the Church from there.

This was true even before the Allied forces arrived. He roamed the battlefield rather than being at the Crusader headquarters.

I was so committed to the war that I was too far removed from the practice.

That's what Elion Bolton did.

I tried too hard.

To work too hard, to fulfill your responsibilities and beliefs as a powerful paladin who fights for herself.

I didn't care about politics.

"So, the popes have decided to change all that, and of course, if they hold a knife to my throat and tell me not to do that, I'm going to have to nod my head no, but I've already been screwed over enough by the time the motherfuckers tell me about their pagan holocaust plans, so I'd rather have someone there who listens to me and knows what I'm thinking."

"No way......."

Elayon Bolton stares at the demon, mouth agape.

"I met Rowen too late, I don't know if it was before he did something crazy, but if we let this continue, either all the heathens will die or the Empire will be crushed."

The devil had to decide.

"The Five Great Houses of God will be united, and a new religious system will be established that incorporates demonism and warrior religions to protect all pagans. No, you're not a pagan anymore, you're a part of the Order."

Unified Cult.

"And my sister, who I know well, will be the head of it."

The arrows and bombs fired by the others explode here and there, eventually converging into one big blast.

In the end, it was both a great unifier and a great divider.

Instead of preventing disruption now, it will be a key part of the divide later.

"In the middle of the Empire....... and plant the flag of Darkland in the middle of the Empire......."

The forces of the Devil have entered the ecliptic, and all who are observant know it.

"Yeah."

If we don't do this, we might break everything, so the devil is in the details.

We tried to utilize the Five Great Houses, but the situation has gotten out of hand. As such, we are in a situation where we cannot survive unless we make greater improvements to our constitution.

What would have been deferred to the future had he not tried to kill Rowen, was rapidly accelerated by a single decision by Elayon Bolton.

"The purge and all that, I honestly didn't agree with it, which is why I left you guys alone, but I think Rowen, that crazy bitch, was right."

"......."

"It seems to me that new booze should be in new bottles."

If you take control of a group and then leave it alone, you're leaving vested interests in place, and you're not really in control. You can hide as much as you want to hide from the top, and you can collude as much as you want to collude.

"It was impossible to just lend them a name."

If you're going to do it, do it right.

And brutally.

You want to make sure there is no warping.

I realized that purges are not uncommon even in times of chaos, and that in a time when the world is shaking, it would be foolhardy to try to take control of a group and not take out the incumbents.

I thought I controlled the Church and the Templars because I had the Popes and the Crusaders.

But the reality was that I hadn't gotten the slightest bit of control.

The existing popes have always harbored the idea of purging the pagans at some point, so they are not the right people for a reformed religious system, nor can we hope to inject new ideas into their inevitably aging heads. If they did cooperate, it would be under the guise of cooperation.

Eliminated popes who thought they had power when they didn't.

And this time, Elion Bolton.

It has power, it has symbolism, and it has a lot of followers.

The de facto core of the Order's power.

Had Elayon Bolton returned safely to the Allied garrison, civil war could have erupted in the ecliptic, depending on his choices.

"The popes are a pain in the ass, but you've done your best, and all you've gotten is a handshake?"

In reality, Elion Bolton didn't even sell the Church to the devil; that was the choice of the popes.

The purging of Rowen was ultimately done because it was best not to have that kind of chaos at this point.

"But since I've decided to push Rowen, I can't come with you."

But that doesn't change the fact that Elayon Bolton is an established faction now that the Purge has begun.

Not backing down because you're doing it wrong, but backing down because you have to.

Purge is what it is.

And now that he has chosen to take Rowen's hand, Elayon Bolton, the man who tried to kill Rowen, is no longer a threat to the Crusaders.

"That's why, unlike the popes, I want to give you a choice."

Elayon Bolton stared at the Demon King with a stony expression.

"Options......?"

"Yeah, just two."

The devil holds up two fingers.

"First, you die on this spot by my hand."

The devil folds his fingers together.

"Second, retire gracefully."

Retirement.

It was more unthinkable than death.



* * *



There was an uncomfortable silence on the top floor of the Great Hall of the Crusaders.

The survival of a priest who was thought to be dead.

And the scene where that priest murdered five popes in cold blood.

Olivia Ranze, who disappeared with the devil.

We don't know how it all started, but Olivia Ranze was straightforward.

The Crusader Knights and the Order of the Five Masters now belong to the Devil.

Ellen's fists were clenched, unable to do anything, and so were Louise and Heinrich.

"Nonsense....... nonsense......."

Only Ludwig is there, glaring at Olivia Ranze.

"How can you be here? How can the Devil have the Crusaders? That can't happen....... It can't happen! How could you! Like this....... Like this. Like this. Talking shit like that in the middle of the ecliptic!"

Ludwig's dormant anger and self-pity explodes.

"Don't you have the slightest sense of guilt? Do you know how many people died because of you? And this was all the Devil's plan? How dare you have the nerve to do this......!"

"Hey."

"Am I talking to you?"

"......what?"

Olivia clicks her tongue briefly.

"And who are you in the first place?"

"!!"

As far as Olivia could remember, Ludwig was just a passing acquaintance.
