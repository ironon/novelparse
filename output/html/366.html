Herriot was reluctant to tell me about the conversation for two reasons.

One, because no matter what, you're going to end up badmouthing your friend's parents.

Secondly, I was afraid it would hurt me to hear it.

Back at the Temple, Herriot and I sat down to talk in an empty lab at the Magic Research Society mansion.

Herriot is invited to breakfast.

The Duke and Duchess of Granz were there.

Duke Granz looked puzzled, as if he hadn't expected Harriet to be at the breakfast table.

Of course, being the only one invited to breakfast would have made Harriet even more flustered.

"It's just what....... It started out with my parents asking me how I was doing, if I wanted to come to the ecliptic, and stuff like that."

The Duchess apparently had a lot of questions about Herriot, the daughter of the Archduke, not Herriot, the Temple student.

Herriot hesitated, as if he wasn't sure if he should be talking about this or not.

"And then....... Suddenly, you weren't sure if living in the temple was really a good thing....... He said something like that, and I thought......."

"What do you mean?"

"The temple educates commoners, so....... People from noble or royal families, when it's time for them to marry, what they did at the Temple becomes a scandal." ....... You don't talk about it, but behind the scenes, it's all gossiped about....... Who did what with whom, you know, this, that, and the other thing......."

a.

I get what you mean.

"So, you're saying that because Temple is a money-only school, if you're from a noble background, and you're hooking up with this guy or that guy, it's going to hurt you later in life in terms of marriage or whatever?"

"Moo, what are you talking about, that's hurtful!"

When I put it too bluntly, Harriet turned bright red and exclaimed.

But my harshness of expression caused him to slump down on the table in a rather defeated manner.

"Anyway....... I mean, you're right, just being from Temple can be a disadvantage for a guy or girl when they're looking for a mate later in life....... There are some situations where it's hard to get the proper treatment....... This."

As she says this, Herriot's forked hair falls haphazardly across the table.

That's cute.

"So the ransom is dropping?"

"Mo, ransom?! Your expression is real....... I have to agree though. That's why it's better for a young lady to have a tutor than to be educated in a place like the Temple, where she's expected to behave herself and mingle with people of lowly origins....... That way she can find a good husband later in life. By saying these things......."

"Marital quarrel?"

"That's right......."

Duke Granz exploded, and the Duchess and Duke fought over Herriot.

That's why Duke Granz apologized, because he didn't want you to see them arguing in front of his daughter's friends.

Herriot must have felt quite uncomfortable, since being called a hobo would have been a collective insult to all of his friends who had come to play.

This is not something I would say to my friend's parents, but I think the Duchess is a great lady who doesn't have the class to match her ego.

"Anyway, do you see why I didn't want to talk about it?"

"......Yes."

I didn't want to say anything because it would end up being gossip about my friend's parents, and I didn't want to hurt her feelings by crying about her humble beginnings.

"Honestly, I don't know."

Herriot sighs heavily.

"Seeking your worth from others, who you're married to, what you're like in the eyes of others, and living your life for those things." ....... Yeah, you're right, ransom. To care only about one's own ransom. If that's the behavior of a proper noble."

Herriot sees me.

"How the hell is that different from slavery?"

If you care too much about your own ransom, you end up commoditizing yourself.

A lifestyle that says you have to act and live clean and not associate with the lowly in order to find someone who will buy you more.

At the end of the day, she says, she doesn't see how that's any different from being a slave.

"I don't think my value comes solely from myself, but it doesn't come solely from anything else either, so....... a little. It's uncomfortable."

Oops.

"Awww, this is so sweet. When did she get so big?"

I'm so excited I want to bite it, but this?

Her brow twisted as I patted her head.

"Ack, what are you talking about, again, I'm a kid, don't do that!"

Harriet yelped, smoothing her disheveled hair.

"If this time last year he was telling Ludwig that he was offended when a B-class came into his A-class dorm, this is a big deal."

"!!!!"

Her face turned so bright red at my words that she looked like she was going to melt.

If facial expressions could tell you that you want to die of embarrassment, it would be this one.

"Well, don't talk about the old days....... That, and it's not about nobility or commoners....... Profit....... I don't know. Idiot. I hate you. Gee, how the hell do you even remember that......."

Eventually, Herriot's mouth stuck out like a sore thumb.

He's being deadly cute today. Is this what happens when you decide you have nothing to say?

The Duchess's attitude, while unfortunate, isn't all that strange.

In fact, there are many royalty and aristocrats who would rather not enter the Temple because they don't want to be educated alongside commoners and have no status. In reality, there are many royalty and nobility in the Temple, but there are also many people who would rather not enter the Temple because they don't want to be educated alongside the commoners and have no status.

So there are quite a few aristocrats in the same position as Duchess Granz.

In reality, Herriot is only doing this because he's ashamed of what he's said in the past, and he's always been one to categorize people by talent and status.

He would still be that way if I hadn't forced him to train his immunity.

"Honestly, when I think about it, the nobles and royals around me were strangely nice."

"Huh? Suddenly?"

"No, you're right, no matter how much Temple says you're not supposed to do it, you can actually do anything you want to lean on authority or status, and I don't recall anybody doing that to me."

At my words, Harriet stares at me with her mouth hanging open.

"Man, you're a real....... after everything you've been doing at the Temple?"

I didn't touch it because it was dirty, because if I did, I'd get hit, and you're not supposed to talk about how nice people are around you, Harriet nagged me for a while.

This is not what the guy who curses and punches you in the face when you try to take a picture is going to say.

No, not that one.

"No, I don't mean that, I mean, there are grown-ups."

"Adult?"

"Yeah. Your parents or something....... etc."

The Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan said that there was no point in having a title, since he would end up in one anyway.

Bertus called them equals under him.

Charlotte, for her own reasons, warmed up to me over time.

Duke Granz is honestly like the guy next door in terms of what he does.

Even the Emperor, although this may be due to the position that me and Ellen hold, is someone who says that you don't have to say yes when you're alone.

So there were no arrogant, self-important aristocrats like the Duchess of Granz around.

No.

It was.

Like Erhina Heinrich.

Heinrich got a few punches from me and became a good boy, and Erich saw the kids getting beaten up and he crumbled. No, Erich took a few hits from me, didn't he? I'd completely forgotten.

Um.......

Herriot wasn't wrong.

All those guys got something done to them.

When I heard that the Duchess of Granz was the epitome of arrogant aristocracy, I questioned what I had taken for granted.

"But didn't Riana care much about identities in the first place?"

"Hmm?"

Liana De Granz.

They give off an unapproachable vibe in the first place, and that's because they're cold.

In reality, he's not all furry and cuddly, and he sees and treats people as they are.

They even used to drag the Ganodab executioner around during festivals.

"I think it was....... I think."

If Riana dislikes or rejects someone, it's because she dislikes them, not because of their background.

I took it for granted that the aristocrats around me were students, parents, and people who didn't talk to me about status.

Duke Granz's cavalier treatment of commoners is rather unusual.

No matter how much Riana pretends to dislike her dad, it's clear that she's more influenced by him than her mom.

A father who treats everyone with respect, a mother who carries herself like an aristocrat, and a mother who takes authority very seriously.

Between the two of them, she takes after her dad, which is why she's so furry and blunt.

Now for the final.

There's one last step left.

"What do you say to each other when you have an argument?"

"Why do you keep asking me that?"

"They say the most fun in the world is watching a fight, and if the fancy dukes are having a fight, why shouldn't I be curious?"

"No one's wondering about that, you're so evil!"

Herriot mumbles in frustration, as if he can't win against my vicious questioning and prying.

Herriot was sitting in a seat he didn't want to be in, but he has a good memory after all.

"It's just....... The Duke said that status doesn't make you a person....... He said that if you think that way and treat people that way, you'll end up with no one left around you. The lady said....... that you are the epitome of the kind of person nobles go to the temple to be ruined....... So......."

There was a mix of indistinct sounds, but this cleared it up.

The Duke's head must have spun at the sight of his wife imposing her own ideas on him, bringing her daughter's friend to breakfast without his daughter present.

Anger makes you lose your mind.

An identity is not a person.

That says it all.

Duke Granz would have joined the revolutionary forces.



* * *



Three days later.

"He is thorough."

I was in my dorm room at Temple listening to Sarkegar's report.

"How much?"

"I wonder if your guess is a stretch....... I didn't find anything that would make me think so."

At my instruction to investigate the Duke of Granz, Sarkegar sprang into action.

You may not be able to get into the most heavily guarded places, but the Duke of Granz is not one of them.

However, we did not find anything to prove that he was connected to revolutionary forces.

"If he's really involved, I suppose we'll find out in time....... Someone that thorough wouldn't leave any evidence behind. The use of coded correspondence is also something we can't figure out until we recognize the pattern and method. Nobles are so used to writing that we don't know which of the letters and papers they produce in a day are connected to the revolutionary forces. And even if we did, we wouldn't know what's in the encrypted content, since a very mundane note of regards could be a coded letter."

The last visit by Owen de Getmora was very likely a business trip, not a revolutionary one.

It was Owen de Getmora, who was clearly affiliated with the revolutionary forces, who eventually convinced the Duke of Grants that he might be a revolutionary.

If the Duke of Granz is indeed a revolutionary, it means that he is a very thorough man, contrary to the impression that he is the nice guy next door.

Sarkegaard didn't find the proof.

"However, I think your judgment is sound."

"Why?"

However, Sarkeghar agrees that Duke Granz is a member of the revolutionary forces.

"I, too, have a foot in Imperial social circles under the name of Count Argon Ponteius."

"I suppose."

"It's no secret that Arthur de Granz, the current Duke of Granz, had a love affair with a commoner woman he met at the Temple."

"Ah."

Is that what you meant by being the epitome of someone who went to the temple and ruined their life?

"So, how did it go?"

"If he did manage to escape, it couldn't have been Duke Granz."

Commoners and Love's Escape.

And fail.

"Isn't that enough of a background to make you curse who you are and where you come from?"

Sarkegar, dressed in a maid's outfit, grins wickedly, his white teeth bared.

Please.

Yeah you do realize that look is making us look about three times more evil than we actually are, right?

Anyway, that said, the Duke and Duchess of Granz are now married in an arranged marriage.

"Of course, Duchess Granz was never that status-conscious in the first place."

"I don't know, but the Duchess seems to be a bit of an asshole."

Sorry, Liana.

But your mom is an asshole.

Oh, sorry....... I'm sorry.

At my words, Sarkeghar tilts his head in a hmmm kind of way.

"If you think about it, the Duchess of Granz has a story, too. She's bound to be that kind of person......."

Having spent some time in the aristocracy, Sarkeghar had a fair amount of background knowledge about social circles and aristocratic physiology without having to do any research.

"The Duke of Granz tends to keep to himself in social circles, but the Duchess is a bit different."

"Hmm......."

"But every social gathering or party you attend, you're unknowingly being labeled as such."

Sarkegar smiles grimly.

"The Duke of Granz, who was forced to marry by his family after failing to escape his love."

"Someone who is bound to be in a failed marriage."

"A woman who was too gluttonous to be loved by her husband."

"A wretched woman who married the Duke of Granz because she coveted his power and risked a scandalous marriage."

It was eerie to hear.

"She is a noblewoman whose status was elevated because the Duke of Granz was literally a scandalous man. She's a poor, foolish woman whose very existence has become a scandal because she was originally just the second daughter of the Countess of Hanahan, who had no estates and only a title."

What she got for marrying a scandalous man was the title of Duke of Granz.

But she's despised by her social circle, and rumors follow that she's a nasty woman who abandoned her dignity to advance her status.

It was inevitable, then, that she would become someone who clung to the status of being Duchess of Granz, something she had earned after risking it all.

You despise scandal with a passion, but you end up ignoring the fact that it's what got you everything.

"I can't imagine that marriage would have been smooth sailing."

A duke who fails to escape his love and ends up being captured.

A duchess who, knowing that he was in such a situation, arranged a marriage to a great nobleman to elevate her status.

The Duchess knew it was a failure and clung to the power and prestige she thought she had gained from her marriage. If she denied that, she would have chosen a life of failure.

The duke forced the marriage.

The fact that they don't have any children other than Riana is further evidence of the failure of their marriage. At least they have Riana.

A duchess who has become obsessed with her identity.

A duke who would have looked at such a duchess and cursed her, wondering what the hell identity is.

Even from the Orbis class, long the cradle of revolutionary forces.

As Sarkozy says, there's no proof, but there's too much circumstantial evidence.

Just as Charlotte was convinced that Valier was the king's heir because of so many circumstances, even though she had no conclusive evidence.

So much so, that the Duke of Granz had now joined the revolutionary forces.

I thought about Duke Granz being a revolutionary, but in the end, I didn't have an answer.

"Okay. Anyway, whether or not Duke Granz is really involved is something I'll find out naturally when I make contact with the heads of state. What's your take on my not being there?"

"He looked disappointed, but there's a meeting of the heads of state coming up, and he's going to be there. If the Duke is a key player, he's going to be there."

"Okay. Then everything will be clear."

But in the end, a possibility is just a possibility.

I hadn't gotten to the point where I could say anything definitive yet, and even though I knew that Duke Granz was a revolutionary, I couldn't yet see how that would be a card for me.
