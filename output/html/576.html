Bringing a dead friend back to life.

If it was completely impossible, I wouldn't have even tried.

But what is half-heartedly possible will eventually lead people to despair because they will never be able to achieve complete success.

It's a ridiculous world, but the truth that death is irreversible seems to be the only thing that can't be overturned.

We couldn't save Ashur, and we wouldn't have even tried in the case of Delphine, whose body we couldn't even find.

It's just a restore that looks like a resurrection.

You may have the abilities, strength, and appearance of a living person, but you have no self.

It's just an animated taxidermy.

This can be used in combat, but not in relationships.

Battle may be more useful than life, but it is of no use to those who hope for a true resurrection, and it should not be used for such a thing.

The topic of Ashur has silenced us.

I didn't bring up the topic any further.

If only the dead could come back.

We all think about it.

It wouldn't just be Christina and Anna and Louis Ankton, it would be Bertus, and it would have to be Savior Tana.

"Reinhardt."

"Uh."

"You can't justify all of this."

"I didn't know you were the kind of guy who cared about that."

"I never thought I'd care about this either."

Bertus smiles bitterly.

We were the prince and the beggar, now we're the emperor and the devil.

"I owe you an apology."

"I don't need an apology for the past, I told you."

"No, that's not what I'm talking about."

Bertus leads the way.

"Follow me."

As I followed Bertus, more massive ports began to appear. They were three times larger than the others, and while I couldn't recognize the bodies in each compartment, it was clear that restoration work was being done on very important bodies.

Bertus stands in front of a petri dish and looks at me.

As if to say look inward.

In front of me was the body of someone.

He's a gray-haired old man.

"This is the body we've had for a while now, and we kind of expected it, but it's not opening its eyes, even though we succeeded in restoring it, so to speak....... failed. He must have been important to you....... I'm sorry. I had to write what I could, and what I didn't have to say....... I wanted to tell you that I wasn't working with the Black Order, that I wasn't deliberately deceiving you. If you resent me, I have nothing to say to you......."

"...... Who is this?"

What is this in the first place?

How is this apologizing?

As I stood there dumbfounded, so did Bertus and Savior Tana.

Like I'm surprised by something I don't know.

"No, what do I have to say to you to make you forgive me or get mad at me? Who is this person......."

Elderly.

Gray hair.

Saying you're sorry.

"Oh wait."

I think I know what it is.

"Is this him....... Is that him?"

Who.

I don't remember the name.

"Larken Simonsteinstein."

Saviolin Tana answered on her behalf.

"The Four Heavenly Kings of the Darklands and my mentor."

Yeah, him.

Saviolin Tana nods slowly, as if remembering something.

"Come to think of it, you said you lost all memory of being Prince of the Darklands......."

"ah......."

Bertus nodded, as if it had dawned on him.

The person I'm supposed to recognize has no face, no memory, and Bertus is apologizing for stepping on my toes.

But.......

That, to say the least.

I'm such a weirdo that I don't even recognize the face of the Warrior King.



* * *



Larken Simonsteidt.

Former Squadron Xanafel leader and one-time Grandmaster of the Continental First Sword.

A being who retired from active service, but somehow became the Four Heavenly Kings of the Demon Army after the outbreak of the Demon War.

That's why he was hated by all mankind.

After the Demon War, the body of Larken Simonsteid was taken from the Empire. They didn't need a reason to take it.

But after the events of the Gate, Bertus saw no reason why Larken's body shouldn't be used to resurrect countless war heroes.

Bringing a Grandmaster back from the dead with all of their abilities intact would be an incredible power.

However, just as we did not succeed in golemizing all the corpses, Larken Simonstein's body was not resurrected. We don't know if this is because something was done to it, or if it simply failed.

Anyway, Bertus apologized because he thought he might have been important to me, and things got weird when I didn't remember Larken at all.

No, but now that you believe me, you still don't believe that I have any memory of Darkland?

It's not that I don't believe it, it's just that I haven't considered it.

Honestly, I don't feel the slightest bit guilty about trying to capitalize on Larken's body.

You don't need to know anything to be upset.

If I can't relate to the Ancestral Demon King, how can I relate to the Four Heavenly Kings?

"Do you have the bodies of the other Four Heavenly Kings?"

Bertus shook his head at my question.

"No, we retrieved the body in the first place to study whether magical means were used in Larken's betrayal."

"Oh....... I see."

The body was recovered to determine if it had used magic to brainwash the Grandmaster.

"Of course, Larken wasn't brainwashed."

I knew everything there was to know.

What the Empire was doing. What was really going on.

Ethically, it's totally fucked up, it's dangerous, and it could be a huge threat later on.

If you're looking for an excuse to spill the beans, there's nothing you can't do.

But that's all the more reason to leave it alone.

We were already well into the research and development phase.

The golems are already in use as guards near the College of Magic, as well as in the extermination squads that patrol the outer reaches of the ecliptic and slay monsters.

Wearing a helmet so no one can recognize you.

The guards are armed, of course, so no one will suspect anything.

"Reinhardt, if this army is committed, the Allies may end the war sooner than planned, maybe even in an instant."

"I suppose."

If the heroes of history are brought back to life, humanity's power will rise to a level never before seen in history.

Not even the heyday of the Demon Kingdoms would compare.

No matter how many monsters there are in the gate, it doesn't matter. Maybe even the dragons of the otherworld are hunted in vain.

It was almost surreal to realize that the end of the gate crisis was so close.

What I saw was both horrifying and overwhelming at the same time.

Their army may pose a threat to Edina and I, but the last warp gate is our priority.

This army of the dead may, in the end, be the key to preventing me from using Alsbringer at the last minute.

The rest is history.

"I'm going to have to pay for all this someday."

"......."

"Reinhard, I need to talk to you."

Bertus said as if he had made up his mind.



* * *



I spoke with Bertus, and it wasn't a long conversation.

The price for all this work.

Someone has to pay the price.

There were a few other stories, but that's what it came down to.

So, I decided not to touch the empire and this project.

It's not even touchable.

As for the Black Order connection, I decided to take it with a grain of salt.

Eventually, you have to choose something.

Whether this is a regrettable choice or a better one is unknown at this point.

After finishing the conversation, I stepped out into the lobby.

Saviolin Tana looks at me. She is very suspicious, questioning, and angry at Larken Simonstein's decision.

He hated them, called them traitors who had betrayed humanity.

But now Saviolin Tana will never know what that betrayal was all about.

"Lord Tana, I don't know much about Larken Simonsteid."

"......."

"But the Great Demon Valier wanted to create a new world with Akasha, which he took from Cantus Magna, and move all the demons to it."

Sure enough, I saw a letter written by the Ancestral Demon King.

"Perhaps Larken Simonstein would have agreed with the devil."

The only people who knew the true purpose of the Ancient Valier were the Demon King himself, me in my Valier days, and the Four Heavenly Kings.

Larken Simonstein would have helped complete Akasha.

"You know, they didn't want to fight."

If the demons were gone, so would the knowledge of demons and humans, and there would be no fighting.

But because Akasha was such a powerful weapon, there was no room for dialog or persuasion.

They didn't understand each other, so they fought, and one was wiped out.

"It was...... would be......."

Saviolin Tana shook her head, speechless.

In the end, I wanted peace.

The wishes and desires of all beings are trivially simple.

I want to be happy.

I don't want to get hurt.

I wish the world were at peace.

Those simple, intuitive desires lead to different behaviors.

Someone for peace, someone for a new world.

For the sake of peace, someone has to draw a sword.

"Akhya said....... What happened?"

"I don't know. I probably won't be able to use it again."

We don't know where Akasha came from or what it is.

All that remains in the world is what misused Akasha has caused. We are the ones who must fix it, scrape what's left of the world, and reap what little tranquility there is.

Your work is done.

I was doing something more dangerous than I realized, but I decided to leave the empire alone.

There are no reversals.

"Are you going?"

"Uh, I should go. What's the point of staying here?"

Bertus looked a little disappointed.

"Wait, how do I find you?"

As I turned to leave, Bertus asked.

No, that was a weird way to say it.

You're really getting there, aren't you?

"Dormitory."

"......?"

"She's in the dorm, probably in Ellen's room."

"......?"

"I'll be here for the winter, if you have anything to say."

The look on Tana and Bertus' faces when I turned into a cat was priceless.

-Angel

"......."

"......."

I don't feel embarrassed anymore.

I'm not the least bit shocked that you're looking at me like that!

-NanNan

"You crazy....... asshole......."

I pretended to be cute and they both looked even better.

Honestly, it's kind of cute.

I look cute in the mirror when I look like this, too.

Ludwig was given a special assignment.

None other than a priest who cleanses the plague from the refugee zone.

To guard that priest.

Ludwig and Rowen talked as they headed into the epidemic zone.

"You're not being escorted by the Crusaders, are you......?"

It is too dangerous a place for a single priest to roam alone. When Ludwig asked if it wouldn't be safer to be escorted by paladins with armor, Rowen shook his head.

"If we had the manpower to do that, we'd be better off sending priests to more places."

"......I see."

Ludwig nodded when I told him that we were absolutely understaffed and had no choice but to be scattered like this.

And with the majority of priests and paladins deployed on the battlefield, manpower was even more scarce.

"If you don't mind my asking, ....... What happened to your arm......."

"I was bitten by a snake."

"Snake......?"

"It was a snake with petrifying venom. It wasn't a very big snake, but....... Just because it's a monster doesn't make it any less dangerous."

"I see......."

Rowen looked at Ludwig's empty arms and couldn't hide her sadness.

"It's okay. It's better than losing your life."

Is it better to lose an arm and survive than to die and never come back?

Ludwig doesn't know if that's true, but he thought he should say it anyway.

It's not about the arm you lost.

It's painful to think of all the other things I've lost.

"By the way, is the pandemic problem....... how serious is it?"

So Ludwig forced himself to change the subject.

"I don't think the individual epidemics themselves are that big of a problem, because not all epidemics necessarily lead to death - most of them are small, cold-like illnesses, for example."

"Is that so?"

"Yes, but the point is that a cold in a healthy person is not the same as a cold in a debilitated person."

"Oh....... I see."

For a healthy person, a cold may last a few days, but for a debilitated person, a cold is a serious illness that can take their life.

"The basic conditions are too poor, and even if they are cured, they can't stop their weakened bodies from dying."

Death by debilitation is not a disease and cannot be cured.

Those who are already weakened, even if they are recovered from the disease, will die because their energy is already exhausted. That cannot be prevented.

"And if those bodies are left unattended and decay, they'll start another plague. It's a cascade."

Ludwig's complexion darkened further at Rowen's words.

"At least it's winter now, so decay is slow, so the plague is less than it was last summer, although I wouldn't call that a good thing."

A corpse left out in the cold will not decompose.

But that's not a good thing, because the cold itself can kill you.

The pandemic is a problem in and of itself, but more importantly, the inhospitable environment itself.

People are dying from diseases that don't have to be.

So even if we eventually clean up this epidemic, it's always a work in progress because there will inevitably be another one, Rowen added.

Rowen is the kind of person who knows it's poison, but has to pour water on it.

"First and foremost, we are short of priests. With most of our paladins and priests on the front lines, Tuan's priests have been reduced in absolute numbers. Some have died, but many more have converted or....... abandoned their faith."

"Oh....... I see."

"Yes, because of the devil's work......."

There are countless examples of believers who felt betrayed by their god who chose the devil, and left the faith.

The Tuan and Als faiths have a problem not only with their adherents, but also with their priests, whose numbers are dramatically lower than before.

The remaining priests and paladins were sent to the front lines.

So it's no wonder that there are always a shortage of Tuan Cult priests to deal with the plague.

Even for the priests of Tuan, the entire ecliptic, let alone the refugee zone, is somehow more dangerous than the battlefield.

Ludwig began to wonder if Lowen's staying in the ecliptic to help clean up the plague might be a more dangerous and noble endeavor than going to war.

Rowen was wandering around looking for work that no one praised, work that he had to do in a place where everyone hated him.

And he didn't give up his faith in Tuan.

"I often wonder if I'm human."

Rowen says, walking still.

Rowen says, looking down at the floor.

"What the devil is really like."

Demon.

It's like a stone in your throat.

For most people, the devil is a symbol of hate and a sign of despair.

Rumors abound about what the Devil is like.

But Ludwig wasn't the only one who heard the rumors.

That's why I hate it all the more.

We lived in close proximity to each other and didn't realize he was a demon.

"He was a classmate."

"Is that ......?"

"I lived with the devil in the temple."

"!"

Rowen stared at Ludwig with his mouth hanging open.

Ludwig is now a household name, for better or worse.

I realized that just by being in the presence of someone special, I was bound to be treated as special.
