Increased holy power and magic.

Even if Radia Schmidt wins against Olivia, there's no reason for Olivia to regain her faith by saying, "I'm nothing without divine power.

-curl!

Olivia energizes, and the finals of the Unlimited Tournament begin.

"I feel....... kind of."

"I see."

As me and Saviolin Tana listened in on their conversation, we couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding.

Radia Schmidt is trying to do something.

-Quack!

Contrary to my ominous premonition, I couldn't quite tell who had the upper hand.

Let's be clear, Radia Schmidt is also an incredible talent.

However, Olivia Ranze, who faces it with only a magic boost, is no match for it. That said, if you add Divine Power to the mix, Olivia's advantage becomes overwhelming.

No matter how offense-oriented Als' power is, Tuan's power has the power to reinforce it. If Olivia can use that, it should be easy for her to take the win over Radia Schmidt.

What the hell is Radia Schmidt going to do, force Olivia to use her divine powers when she realizes she's lost?

Olivia said that if that happened, she would be taken to the Inquisition.

So even in the face of losing a set to Herriot, I didn't use divine power.

"Just for ......'s sake, what happens when Olivia Senior uses her divine powers when she has officially renounced her faith?"

I asked because I had heard of it, but didn't really know it.

"You're not going to get a good look at ......."

Charlotte said in a negative tone.

"...... Those who use unauthorized divine power are treated as witches."

Saviolin Tana replied.

Priest or Paladin.

Whether you're ordained or not, you have a license to practice divine power. With the exception of this class of students, who are more like apprentices.

To monopolize divine power.

Olivia wasn't secretly healing people in a village in the middle of nowhere; she was called the Saint of Eredian.

If you give up faith, divine powers must disappear. The power comes from the belief in God.

But Olivia's divine powers didn't fade, they only grew stronger.

However, it must not be used. Divine power unused in the arms of a god is considered heresy.

"If that were to happen, Olivia wouldn't be considered a witch. But she would be put on trial."

If Olivia were to use holy power, she would be using unauthorized holy power in public. As such, there is a good chance that she could be framed under the guise of an Inquisition or Inquisition.

Radia Schmidt will try to force Olivia to use her divine powers.

But how?

Olivia didn't even use her holy power in the moment of her defeat by Herriot.

At the tournament, Olivia fights like it's a strength she doesn't have.

If you lose, you lose, and you're not going to be forced to use divine power.

-Bang! Quack!

A blow from Radia Schmidt sends a dull thud across the arena, and Olivia takes it with a single sword.

Not only was Olivia deflecting the destructive holy power with the power of her magical enhancements, but she was also counterattacking.

I don't know about anything else, but is that really a human fight?

I was like, "Oh, yeah.

"Great, both of you."

The world's greatest monster was standing next to me praising it.

It was an uphill battle.

Radia Schmidt fights with everything she's got.

Olivia Ranze only uses magic enhancements.

If it weren't for Olivia, Radia Schmidt would be in her place.

Radia was good enough to think that. But she wasn't jealous of Olivia, she was trying to put Olivia back where she belonged.

Obsession, not jealousy.

In the end, both are exhausting.

-Kurung!

A white glow emanated from the sword as Radia's divine power converged, and it slammed into the ground.

-Kookaburra!

I wondered if that was holy power. Divine power focused on destruction was more powerful than magic.

After Herriot, I could almost see the stadium, which had been reinforced even further, being ripped apart in real time.

That's a paladin.

In fact, I'm beginning to wonder if berserker might be a better word.

But Olivia's dealing with it was just as crazy.

He'd parry or dodge dangerously powerful attacks, and he'd poke out attacks just in time to keep Radia on her toes.

In terms of overall output, Radia is ahead.

Olivia, however, was a bit more sophisticated and pressured Radia with her predictable attacks and counters.

As such, the outcome of the match was somewhat predictable.

Radia is doing well, but Olivia will win.

I'm not belittling my opponent like I did with Herriot.

Olivia may not be using her divine powers, but she's still keeping her guard up.

Radia Schmidt has a trick up her sleeve.

If you're trying to force Olivia to use her holy power, how does that work?

Olivia attacked Radia with sharp, precise strikes.

-Bang! Quack! bang!

Olivia's onslaught didn't give Radia a chance to catch her breath.

Concatenation on concatenation.

Steadily attacking the divine and enchanted defenses, Olivia finally succeeded in creating a gap.

That's it.

Sensing her victory, Olivia plunged her sword into Radia Schmidt's chest.

Olivia takes the first set.

-Kurung!

I could see an explosion of red energy emanating from Radia Schmidt's body.

"That's......!"

Savior Tana was watching the scene wide-eyed, and Olivia took a big step back in embarrassment.

-Ladia! What are you doing!

-Olivia....... You have to win, right......? You need the money, so....... You're in a tournament, aren't you, kids, and you need to help?

Enveloped in a reddish aura, Radia smiles an eerie smile.

-Beat me with all your might. With all your might.

Radia Schmidt, bathed in an ominous red glow, was anything but normal. Saviolin Tana mumbled something incoherent, as if she knew what that red energy was.

"You're Berserk ....... Why, you're just a student, and you've got that kind of power......."

"What is that?"

"A power rarely used by the higher priests of Alth."

Berserk.

I don't know the details, but the word itself already gives it away. Olivia exclaimed, her face turning white.

-Ladia! Stop it, now!

"That's....... is the power of burning lives."

This is an extreme method used by the Paladins of Alth, who burn their lives to increase their power.

The Paladins of Alth were not berserkers, they were berserkers.

Radia Schmidt was using that power right now in the tournament final.

Radia knows why Olivia needs to win. She knows she's not in it for herself, she's in it for the prize money.

So she was doing this crazy thing where she was burning her own life to boost her power so that Olivia couldn't take her down unless she was at full strength.

You're doing all this to get Olivia to use her divine powers?

-Bang! Ka-kang! kang!

Radia Schmidt was in the middle of pushing Olivia backwards when she was overcome by a red aura.

Charlotte looks at Savior Tana with an uneasy expression.

"Shouldn't we stop it?"

"Yes, but Berserk is a very rare power among the priests of Alth. Even within the Order of Alth itself, there are very few who know how to use it. Olivia seems to know, but....... I wonder if the organizers know what's going on over there now......."

To the untrained eye, it would appear that Radia Schmidt, on the verge of defeat, has suddenly found her strength, unaware that the red energy is a life-burning force.

I glance over to the Crusader Knightmaster, Elayon Bolton, and see that he, too, is in turmoil.

Elayon Bolton was staring at the field with a grave expression on his face, and even the paladins with him were talking amongst themselves in bewilderment.

Even the most senior paladins with the Crusader Master have no idea what Radia Schmidt is doing right now.

Olivia gritted her teeth and fought off the onslaught of Radia Schmidt, who was unleashing a barrage of attacks.

The match should be stopped immediately.

However, if the organizers are unaware of the situation, the game will continue as is.

Olivia is being outclassed by Radia Schmidt, who is drawing on extreme strength. It would be best to defeat her once and for all, but that would require the use of divine power.

That's not an option to consider.

It is possible to hold out without using holy power, but Radia Schmidt, who has run out of life to draw from, will die on the spot.

That's why there's only one way to stop Radia Schmidt from burning lives.

Stop the match.

Or.

Olivia gives up the game.

It was just the two of them.

"Lord Tana, stop the game immediately, or I'll take the blame."

"Yes, Your Highness."

Charlotte said that with a serious look on her face, and Saviolin Tana nodded.

-Abstain.......

A puzzled Olivia abstained.



* * *



Olivia was shivering in the athlete's waiting room, her hands clasped over her face.

Abstained.

"When I grow up, I want to be just like you!

"Hehe, your dreams are too small, you should try to be something much bigger than your sister.

"You're the prettiest, nicest, most amazing person I know.

"Dude, don't make it too high.

Abstained.

"Ms. Olivia, thank you as always.

"Whatever, it's what I have to do.

'But now that I'm in a position to do it, I'm not going to....... I hope you don't overdo it.'

'Abbot, I'm still good, because I think I'm going to win a lot of money at this year's Temple Festival.

"Prizes?

'Yes, the tournament and its....... and the other tournament....... Hmm. There is such a thing. Anyway!'

I abstained.

It was inevitable.

There is no such thing as a second place prize in a Temple tournament.

Most of the audience was stunned.

It was such a disappointing end to a highly anticipated final.

Very few people knew the details. Whether Radia Schmidt's behavior was disqualifying or not is up for debate.

So, for now, I had to wrap up the contest, albeit with a lukewarm reception.

Olivia didn't even think to watch the awards ceremony.

Although the prize is a prize.

She was disappointed that she didn't win, but more than that, Olivia's head felt like it was going to explode.

It was driving me crazy.

I can't figure out why I'm doing this to myself.

I don't know how long I've been sitting there in a daze.

"Olivia."

Radia Schmidt was walking toward Olivia.

-Turp!

She tossed away the gaudy trophy that was proof of her unlimited tournament wins, as if she didn't care about any of that.

Radia approached Olivia.

"Why did you abstain?"

"......."

"Money, you needed it."

Radia Schmidt's face didn't show the slightest hint of joy at her victory.

The only thing he wanted in exchange for the option of burning his life was to use his holy power in public.

When he was taken to the Inquisition, Radia Schmidt risked her life to force him to become a priest again. She risked her life because she knew she had to.

Divine Power could have taken out Radia Schmidt with Berserk.

But that's not what Olivia did.

If it stays that way, Radia Schmidt will be dead.

Olivia was forced to make a choice.

I was faced with a choice between feeding and clothing children who would otherwise go hungry because we had no budget, or forcing myself to live a religious life.

She was forced to choose, and she chose.

"This is not the Olivia I know."

Radia wasn't happy about the win at all. Rather, she glared angrily at Olivia.

"The Olivia I know, in that situation, would have taken me out in a heartbeat, won the prize, and helped people. Obviously, that's what she should have done."

In Radia Schmidt's mind, Olivia is not the kind of person who would abstain in such a situation. She was competing to help someone with her prize money, and in that situation, she should have used her divine power and not thought about herself.

The person everyone expects you to be.

Radia Schmidt was upset that they didn't.

Olivia was blue in the face and shaking.

"Yeah, I'm selfish. I'm going to be selfish now. I'm going to be selfish. I'm going to be that way. This is who I am. This is who I am now....... So. leave me, leave me alone."

"No, Olivia, no, you can't do this. You should have just used your holy power."

Radia Schmidt shakes her head emphatically.

He kneels down in front of Olivia and stares up at her, terrified.

Eyes as black as the abyss stared at Olivia.

"Olivia, you can be the right person again. Look at me, I risked my life, I didn't think about myself, I did this to help you. I wasn't always like this. Olivia, I've always admired the way you help people, and I'm trying to be that person. That's why I did this. So, Olivia, let me help you this time. Olivia, you're only making it harder on yourself. You're gonna have a harder time. No, it's already horribly harsh on you, this situation where you're falling further and further away from God. I didn't do this for nothing. This was the only way. This was the only way that no one would get hurt."

Olivia could barely hear Radia Schmidt, who was talking so fast.

I didn't even want to hear it in the first place.

Radia Schmidt thinks the object of her admiration is being destroyed.

That's why he thinks it's time for him to help Olivia.

"I, I never asked you to do that....... Please......."

"No. No, Olivia, I'm giving you my winnings. I don't want you to be a bad person. You can help the children, but promise me one thing. You'll come back to God. It's not too late. It's not too late."

No matter what you say to someone whose ears are closed, they won't hear you. Olivia squeezed her eyes shut, afraid to look into Radia Schmidt's eyes any longer.

Eventually, Olivia burst into tears.

"Please, don't do this to me....... Please....... Please leave me alone....... Please. Why me. Why does it have to be me....... Please....... Just leave me alone....... I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong......."

"No!"

Radia blurted out, as if she couldn't get over that.

"Olivia, you can't say that! You were chosen by the gods! A perfect person like you, born with the favor of all the five great gods, can't deny them! Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's right. It's called wandering. Oh, the gods are giving you these trials to make you more perfect. Oh, it's all part of their will to bring you to greater glory. So, take your time. Maybe start by going back to the temple. No, let's start slow by talking to people about grace........"

"That's a lot of fucking words."

Suddenly, a voice from the hallway made Radia and the crying Olivia turn their heads toward it.

"Why do you keep preaching to the choir when you don't like it, even street preachers don't stick around this long?"

It wasn't anyone else, but Reinhardt, who approached with rough steps. Reinhard lunged forward, grabbed Olivia's sobbing hand, and pulled her to her feet.

"I'd just smack you in the face if you were talking shit, but you're listening to all that bullshit?"

"......."

"It's none of your business, Reinhardt."

Radia Schmidt said to Reinhardt with a stern look.

"What the hell?"

Reinhardt pulled a shivering Olivia into his arms and tucked her behind me.

"It's not your place to be between us."

"......what?"

"Go fuck yourself."

Reinhardt grabbed Olivia's hand and started dragging her along.

"Uh, where are you going, I can't let go of Olivia, you can't do this!"

At Radia's cry, Reinhardt turned his icy gaze on Radia Schmidt.

"Leave me alone. Don't be an ass."

"......."

Olivia's head was bowed, and Reinhardt's hand pulled her away. Radia watched in disbelief as Olivia was dragged away.

Reinhardt.

That name is a thorn in the neck.

Olivia is glazed and gentle, but she's been stubborn since day one.

But I'm being very generous with him.

The Saint of Tuan, who is supposed to be chaste, acts as if she is in love with him.

No, it all started when Olivia became friends with a guy named Reinhardt.

He's the cause of all this.

We just need him to go away.

Everyone's focusing on the weird side.

You said he's not to be touched.

You're trying to sacrifice another poor child.

'Maggots, scum. The devil.'

In Radia Schmidt's eyes, Reinhardt was the one who corrupted Olivia, who was on the right path.

He shouldn't be there.

Only when he's gone will Olivia be able to get back on track.

You can get back on the right track.

Radia gritted her teeth and stared down the hallway where Olivia had disappeared.

'Yeah....... It's you.......'

I would do anything for Olivia.

'I'd rather have you dead than Adriana or that child, and Olivia will be fine without you....... She'll be fine without you....... Why, a child in the arms of God should be sacrificed for something like you....... No. It only takes one unbeliever like you.'

Radia Schmidt's eyes widened.
