            Episode 424.





To my astonishment, Luna Artorius, who had always seemed like a wall of steel and somehow inhuman, lost her grip on my throat in surprise.

-Hair

"Ewww....... chew......."

I gulped at the pain I felt as my wrist was smashed.

Eleris was still looking at me helplessly, unable to recover from the shock.

It's not a good situation to be in, and she's not the only one who's flustered by it.

Luna Artorius looks down at me from her perch.

"Are you lying to me to save your life at this moment?"

"If you want to believe it's a lie, believe it."

-sigh

I summon Tiamata and unleash my holy power.

Anger, the ingredient for using Tiamata.

Of course, there's no reason not to be angry when you're about to get your head blown off by Ellen's mom in the middle of nowhere.

Holy power heals my wrist.

I stagger to my feet and distance myself from her.

"If you want to kill me and be hated by my daughter for the rest of your life, go for it."

"......."

Luna Artorius stares at me in disbelief, as if it were a threat.

"Ellen won't know you're a demon."

"Yeah, I don't know. I don't want to know, and I can't accept it."

"Yeah, even if you really....... Even if you like my daughter, you two shouldn't be together......."

"Overly meddling in your child's life, that's not good."

What to say.

I don't think we're having this conversation.

I'm afraid for my life, and I'm afraid that I can't actually stand up to him.

I don't know, fuck it, I'll just say whatever comes to mind and fuck it, it's less frustrating.

"We do our own thing."

I aim my Tiamata at Luna Artorius.

"So you're out."

"Uh, ma'am?"

As a parent of a warrior, I wonder what it's like to be yelled at by a demon.

I'm not sure, but it was clear that I felt so stupid that I couldn't laugh or cry.

But for a moment, Luna Artorius's expression turned cold.

"Who's your mother. I never acknowledged you......."

"I have a case, and it's rude to call your crush's mother auntie. You don't know what's going to happen to her, and you can't call her mother-in-law, because you're not there yet. You're not there yet, so what's the point of calling her mom?"

"......."

Once again, Luna Artorius's expression becomes complicated.

I can feel her taking mental damage in real time, even though I can't do it with force or a knife.

What the fuck is this guy saying?

Why do I need to hear this from the devil?

I could almost see him thinking to himself.

How to do this.

Is it working?

Can you crush them and get them to back off?

"And I just heard for the first time today that Elyse over there is an ancient Archdemon or something, so I guess that makes her a distant ancestor of mine."

I have no idea what that means, but assuming it's true, Eleris would be my ancestor.

"Mother, what if I beat my in-laws like a dog?"

"Why the hell do I have to listen to this!"

"No, you're asking me why I did it, so I'm telling it like it is!"

"This, this....... This is ridiculous......!"

You're just like Ellen in that you can hold it in and then burst into flames.

"Mother, you said you weren't interested in the question of good and evil; you weren't interested in what I was trying to do or what I wanted."

"You're breaking the law and trying to kill me for thinking about my daughter."

"I like her. You're not going to believe this, but it's true."

"Choose, Mother. Kill me here and be hated by your daughter for the rest of your life."

"Maybe I'll just back off."

Luna Artorius was stunned as she realized that I was threatening her beyond the hierarchy of power.

If he wants to kill me, I can't stop him.

The bombardment of a distant battle was close, but if everyone in the room wanted to kill him, would it be possible?

I don't know.

Luna Artorius, however, regains her normal expression and stares at me.

You're probably thinking seriously about the fact that I like Ellen.

Beyond whether it's true or false, you'll be thinking about what you should do if it's true.

Eventually, she elongated the hand that held the sword.

There's a clear emotion in her eyes once again.

"Your heart is....... should rather be false."

"......."

"If what you say is true, I would rather....... I'd rather have my daughter die because of it....... I can see nothing but a more unhappy future for her....... Why would you....... my daughter....... Do you love....... There's no reason why you shouldn't......."

There was a deep sadness in her eyes.

"Would you rather die on this spot, leaving everything unfinished....... Wouldn't it be my duty as a mother to stop all this, before a small misfortune becomes a larger one, before my daughter is ruined....... before my daughter is ruined."

"I can't accept you either."

"There is no way my daughter, who has been deceived by you all these years, can accept you."

Heroes and demons.

The fact that I like Ellen is, in and of itself, bound to cause her and me later misery.

If me and Ellen have to fight each other later, it's bound to happen.

So Luna Artorius said, "If it's true that I like Ellen, then maybe that's why we should stop everything right there.

We didn't make that decision.

Ask me for input.

I could already feel it's mind trying to kill me.

Yes.

This is the yard that Ellen's mother knew.

Let's not postpone the tragedy any longer.

"I'll tell you what."

"......what?"

"I don't see the point in hiding it anymore when even your mother knows about it. Ellen will understand, I don't think so....... I know it's hard to accept, but......."

It's scary.

Since I've been deceiving her, I've been postponing the consequences forever, which get bigger the longer I put it off. Ellen will rightly feel betrayed, and she may not be able to accept me.

"You don't want to be killed by me, so you're willing to risk being killed by my daughter."

"Yeah."

Her expression hardened again at my words.

"I'm sure you're feeling cooler inside."

"......You, you weirdo."

Hearing her say that made me chuckle for some reason.

"I've heard that from Ellen a lot."

Weirdo.

That's what we've always heard.

She stares at me.

As if he could read the mind in my eyes.

"I love my daughter, but I don't know why I'm keeping you alive when it's clear that you're going to cause her untold misery....... I don't see why I should let you live."

But the moonlight sword in her hand was gone.

She seemed to read not my emotions but my ominous fate.

"But....... If killing you would make my daughter unhappy....... rather than suffer indelible scars at the hands of her parents....... It's better for her to make her own choice....... At least......."

She stilled and put her hand on my cheek.

"As it has always been, the affairs of the world are the affairs of the world, and the affairs of my daughter, who has gone out into the world, are the affairs of my daughter....... Should I be left alone......."

It was the hand of the man who tried to kill me a moment ago.

It was frighteningly warm.

After what seemed like forever, she removed her hand from my cheek and took a few steps back.

She reached up to the sky. The enlarged moon regained its original size.

What kind of power is that?

I didn't know, and it seemed like I would never know.

"Archdemon....... No, Reinhardt."

"It's ......."

She calls me by name.

"I know it's pointless, but......."

She stares at me.

"Don't make my daughter sad."

Luna Artorius, who sought to kill me not because I was a demon, but because I was a threat to her daughter, was ultimately unable to kill me because I was associated with her misery.

"I'll try."

"......I see you realize that's impossible."

I don't know if Ellen will accept my confession.

But I decided to go with it.

As she had done throughout the fight, she took a step forward without a word.

-sigh

And then, as she had done so many times before, she was gone, melted into the moonlight.

As if you were never here in the first place.

I felt like I was being led by a mirage.

Luna Artorius is gone.

Finally, I could turn my attention to what I really cared about.

"Elise!"

"......下载."

When she'd recovered enough, she pushed herself to her feet and leaned against me.

"I'm glad you're okay, but....... What the hell is going on here......."

"Sure......."

I didn't win a fight, I kicked out my mother-in-law who was going to kill me for saying I liked your daughter.

That level of ridiculousness was enough to make both Elise and I feel a little freaked out.

-Koo-koo-koo-koo!

In the distance, a battle raged.

There was so much fighting going on that you'd be forgiven for not noticing what was going on over there.

And again.

"Reinhardt!"

When I didn't follow, Herriot, who had returned, called out to me and was running with the Archduke in the distance.

"All of a sudden, the moon just got bigger and this....... Uh....... Who is that?"

Both Herriot and the Archduke looked at me and the Eleris I was supporting with a puzzled expression on their faces.

He says he'll follow me, but he doesn't come back for a while, so I realize I'm supporting the wrong person.

They don't know who Elise is.

I wondered if I should explain that I had found an injured person nearby.

-currrrrr

As the already dark night sky was engulfed in even more inky blackness, we couldn't help but look up.

"Is this....... What is it?"

Herriot mumbles with a dumbfounded look on his face.

A moment ago, the moon was dozens of times larger, casting its chilly lunar glow everywhere.

But this time, something else happened.

As if someone had deliberately distorted the middle of the night sky. No, not distorted, but as if someone had grabbed the night sky by the middle and ripped it apart.

Where the night sky had been torn apart, a gaping crack had opened up.

It was a bizarre sight, as if the glass pane of the night sky had shattered, revealing the abyss within.

The Archduke, myself, Elise, and Harriet could only stare in disbelief at the second sudden weather event.

The giant crack in the night sky was just the beginning.

Hundreds of beams of light shot down from the abyss.

We all knew it wasn't a blazing beam of light or a flash.

That's light from the depths of the abyss, burning as the falling body collides with the air.

The light of a shooting star.

"Meteor shower(流星雨)......?"

Not just one, but hundreds of meteors began raining down on the ground.

"The mythical magic of....... How......."

The Archduke mumbles to himself.

I didn't have time to think about whether this magic was real or not.

As if they're all going to die, there's only one who can use this kind of magic.

as Dwin.

It must be a spell he cast.
