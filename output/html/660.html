"That....... What is that......?"

Lucinil was in the midst of a gathering of the Lord Vampires' wizards when he saw a magical star suddenly appear in the sky.

It was a form of magic I'd never seen before, and I had no idea what it was.

"Looks like our cute little scribe has had one hell of an accident."

Antirrhinus could only chuckle at the enormity of the sphere.

Lucinil glares at Antrianus as she casts Massive Destruction.

"Heriot? What is that in the first place?"

"I don't know."

"What, like you know anything about that topic......."

-Flash!

But before Lucinil could finish her sentence, I saw a flash of light from the giant magical orb, slamming into the center of the wave of monsters.

It was simple.

It was a streak of white light.

-Crack!

But the results weren't simple.

An even more widespread explosion than the meteorite's fall obliterated the monsters.

Lucinil was stunned by its overwhelming destructive power.

"It's unknown magic, so it's not going to happen, is it?"

"What the....... the hell?"

Even though they were the inspiration, they couldn't have predicted it would turn out this way.

That flash wasn't the only one.

-Flash!

The blue magic star was shooting its destructive flashes into the sky as well as the ground.

"What the hell is that, some kind of unknown destructive magic, and at that speed?"

"Is there anything magic can't do?"

Antirrhinus' words are the fantasies of dumb wizards and those who know nothing about magic.

Wizards know all too well what magic can't do. So it stands to reason that the Lord Vampires, the world's oldest living wizards, know the most about what magic can't do.

So it was only a malicious joke for Antirrhinus to say that.

But the joke is on them.

-Digitize!

Lightning bolts from magical stars intercept swarms of flying monsters and shoot flashes of light.

The scale of large-scale destructive spells that are instantly unleashed on the battlefield, rather than starting with a magic sphere, has just more than doubled.

An unfathomable amount of magic was being cast, at an unfathomable rate.

"I've lived long enough to know that......."

Antirrhinus smiles.

"Wow, you get to see a lot of things."

Even the heat-loving lunatic could only stare in pure admiration at the miracle of the one and only Wu Sheng for now.

Immortals may be gone, but unknown things are happening on the battlefield.

Meteors are raining down and wiping out the monsters, a demon has appeared and is making his way through the waves of monsters, and an unidentified giant star has appeared in the rear and is providing support fire.

A blue barrier was already forming around all the charging soldiers as well as the destructive magic.

Destroy as well as protect.

Even if you don't understand the situation, everyone knows it's there to help the Allies.

Just when you think the morale of the nearly collapsed Union army is hanging on by a thread, and the retreating soldiers are beginning to find their footing.

-Currrrr!

On the other side of the battlefield, something is beginning to emerge that will fully restore crumbling morale.

The whole space opens up to reveal a colossus.

-Titan......!

-The Titans are here!

Where was the despair at the sight of a giant weapon that could be seen everywhere on the battlefield, and everyone in the Allied army began to cheer.

"Ho ho....... Titans are already coming in."

At Antrianus' words, Lucinil bit her lip.

"This is not a good thing."

"I suppose so."

The Titans were originally intended to be summoned after the Allies had advanced some distance.

But for now, I'm putting the Titan out early because I'm afraid the coalition will collapse before I can get to Diane.

Putting the Titan in for morale means that it can't play a role when it comes to getting into Diane's heart.



* * *



"Is this okay......?"

At Adelia's question, the Archduke shook his head with a stony expression.

"That's not good."

Titans should be used later.

But I had no choice but to use it now, or the Alliance would self-destruct.

However, it will be summoned back to destroy the warp gates in the depths of Diane, where the Titans are really needed.

If so, the moment the Titans disappear, the morale of the Allies may once again hit rock bottom.

Whatever it is, today is the last day.

Whether it's the destruction of continents or the end of monsters.

Everything was on the line in just one day.

The Archduke looks up at a blue star in the sky on the far side of the battlefield.

It was a huge miracle that I don't even know what it means.

A miracle of destruction that shouldn't exist in times of peace.

Titan, then Immortal, and now this.

It's a time when all talent is directed toward destruction.

It was everyone's hope that that era would come to an end today.

-kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!

With the sound of the Ghost Horse, the armies of Deathknight sweep across the battlefield.

Mounted on erratic ghost horses, the Death Knights galloped and trampled the monsters as if they were defying the laws of the world.

The Death Knights and Death Paladins ran wild, leaping over the giant monsters like they were lightweight obstacles, and were too fast for them to reach.

It's a horrifying sight for any human being, but the horror belongs to them now.

And Olivia Ranze, running at the head of the pack, was stabbing, slashing, and crushing the monsters with her giant spear.

For Reinhardt, who would have the toughest fight, Olivia was not using her Tiamata.

But Tiamata's power is not important to Olivia, who has already mastered the power of divinity.

As she sweeps across the battlefield, she raises her hand to the sky, and a massive beam of light descends from the heavens, enveloping the vast battlefield.

-Ohhhhh!

The wounds of the wounded, the fallen and the dying.

That warm holy light is itself a healing light and a source of life.

The power of purity.

Even more powerful than when she was known as the Saint of Eredian, Olivia scatters healing light across the battlefield in a matter of moments, healing everyone in her path.

Dramatic healing was spreading over an incredibly large area.

For those who have experienced that miracle of life, in the end, it's good to be the devil and the emperor.

So sacred.

That's beautiful.

What a warm light to bring into the world.

The one it chooses to follow can never be evil.

In fact, isn't he the manifestation of Tuan, the god of purity?

But Olivia Ranze doesn't care what they think.

Soon, as if to deny those people's changing thoughts, her right hand, as she galloped across the battlefield on her ghostly steed, was suddenly filled not with pure power, but with a shadowy darkness.

Rising acrobatically from her ghostly mount, Olivia soon leaps toward the giant, bell-tower-like monstrosity.

-POOF!

Compared to that behemoth, the spear in Olivia's right hand is a toothpick.

-knowwhat!

However, the black energy from the spear explodes like a thunderbolt, disorienting the giant monster.

-then......!

You think the monster is going to fall, but instead it falls and stands tall.

But the eyes of the giant monster that had just been spitting fire at the world had changed.

As if it were contaminated with something.

The monster's giant eyes glowed with darkness.

Those watching Olivia Ranze's battle are about to find out.

The monsters impaled by Olivia Ranze's spear as she sowed the light of life are rising, not dead.

No, it happens even if you're already dead.

Instead, they charge toward the monsters.

The giant monster turns to face the monsters, not the human army, and begins to spit out searing flames, as if it were in control of something.

Sowing life-healing light.

Use Corruption to control death.

Saint of Life and Death.

Olivia Ranze was killing monsters by raising them from the dead.

Mounting the ghost horse again, Olivia rides up the back of the giant monster to its crown.

It doesn't stop there.

-Currrrrr!

A giant dragon-like creature swoops down, claws raised, toward the head of the monster, which spews flames that burn the monsters.

Olivia prepares her javelin for the dragon, from the ground to the sky.

-Kwalung!

With a thunderous crack, the spear pierces the dragon's behemoth.

-Quadruple!

The falling dragon crashes to the ground, leaving a trail of monsters in its wake.

Olivia rides her ghost horse toward the dragon impaled by the javelin.

Already the dragon was dying, being forced to rise in the power of corruption.

A smile tugs at Olivia Ranze's lips as she rides her ghost horse.

"Yeah......."

Until now, we've had to hide, so we can't show our power.

But now, you have to do everything you can.

"I've always wanted to ride that!"

Leaping from her ghostly mount, Olivia found herself on the back of a rising dragon, shrouded in the power of corruption.

The ghost horse is gone, and Olivia has a new mount.

-Whoosh!

With a gust of wind, a flap of wings, and a single leap, the dragon rises from the dead.

-QuietAllowAllowAllow!

-Currrrrr!

A dragon that spits lightning and flames from its maw.

-Quack! Quack!

Then, in Olivia Ranze's hands, the spirit of youthful death takes the form of a spear and begins to deliver death to the flying monsters.

Flying monsters that die and crash will revive before hitting the ground and start flying once again.

Healing light in the right hand.

A being holding a spear of death in its left hand.

The monsters she kills come back from the dead to slaughter her, and the humans she touches with her healing light come back from the brink of death.

Saint of Life and Death.

Everyone on the battlefield could look up and see the light of death and life shed by Olivia Ranze on her dragon.
