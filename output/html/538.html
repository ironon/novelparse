            Episode 538.





December.

It's winter.

The Alliance forces circled the outskirts of Riseln, starting with Senkerian, destroying the warp gates of the smaller cities one by one.

Small warp gates in small towns had been destroyed by demonic forces as if they were vanguards, and the Imperial General Command had passed them off as the work of the Imperial Vanguard.

Few knew that the Allies were being aided by the Devil.

It had to be top-secret because the confusion the Allies would feel if it became known could have been devastatingly divisive.

It was inevitable that large armies would overwinter. This war would continue beyond the year.

Seven small cities and three medium-sized cities.

So far, so good for the Alliance.

Bertus stood in front of the many military commanders gathered in the Allied General Headquarters, his map in front of him, his face stoic as he watched the operations board.

There's no way to characterize all the battles we've fought so far as small.

But now the Allies were facing the biggest battle of the many they had faced so far.

Large warp gateset.

One very large warp gate.

Small Warp Gate Seven.

Largest city in southern Rieseln.

Serandia.

This is the first time we've destroyed a very large warp gate.

The point is this.

The General Staff begins debriefing.

"Your Majesty, it has been determined that the successful capture of Serandia will significantly reduce the monster hordes in southern Ryzeln."

"I think we can solve the water supply problem locally by using the Lazier River near Serandia as a water source. If we can replace the transportation of water supplies with other supplies, the Allied forces will have an easier time surviving the winter."

"However, due to the nature of winter operations, significant losses of combat power are anticipated during the movement of the main force to Serandia. Furthermore, once the operation begins, retreat will be nearly impossible, so failure is expected to be irreversible and very heavy."

"You could spend the winter focusing on defending your garrison and then begin the campaign against Serandia. However, in this case, it's unclear if your forces will be able to get the supplies they need until spring. The monsters in Serandia will periodically raid the Alliance garrison areas where they spend the winter, and they will continue to be replenished, so there will be no loss of combat power for the enemy."

Bertus narrowed his eyes as he listened to his chief of staff's report.

Winter is the season when everything freezes, and that includes soldiers.

Winter marches are even more hellish than peacetime marches.

There will be soldiers whose frozen toes are actually falling off, not just falling off from exhaustion.

While the priests of the Crusaders can heal with holy magic, not everyone can benefit from it.

Due to the nature of large cities and the waves of monsters that surround them, the Alliance garrison is now set up in a location very far away from Serandia.

Just getting to the battlefield, Serandia, is the hard part.

You're marching in the cold, and the monsters are boiling over as you go.

This is not an environment where you can take a day off and fight with the battlefield just around the corner.

Your troops should be facing the most enemies when they are most exhausted.

In the winter, too.

'Unless there's another weather event on our way and the weather improves, which is not necessarily something you can count on.......'

You will march through the freezing cold to capture Serandia.

After all, you can expect to take a lot of damage in a raid.

And taking Serandia is not the end of the gate crisis.

There are still cities to destroy.

If you suffer an irreversible loss here, the next battle will be even harder.

If it gets harder and harder and we keep losing irreplaceable people.

Eventually, the last gate will not be destroyed, and humanity will lose all hope.

But what if we winter here, hold out until spring, and then attack Serandia?

The military is a huge resource hog.

We need to eat, and we need to eat something to keep us warm.

Then there's Serandia, where monsters pour out of a massive warp gate while you're stationed, albeit far away.

You'll be fighting a defensive battle all winter long, which means you'll lose resources as well as people.

At least if we succeed in capturing Serandia, we'll have enough water to last us through the winter. You'll also be able to cut down the nearby forests to help you survive the winter.

Will you bleed to death in a massive campaign to take down Serandia and then winter there?

You'll be holed up here until the day breaks, fighting a constant war of attrition, and then fighting when you're in better shape.

"We can't survive the winter here. We're going to Serandia."

You can't expect help to always be available.

But there was always help.

So Bertus had no choice but to turn to the forces of evil once again.

The frozen ground in the path of the Allies will thaw, and an anomaly called Warm Sunshine will appear.

The ruler of humanity is dependent on the Devil.

'If this gets to the point where I can no longer get help.......'

I don't have the confidence to not panic at that point.

Bertus self-helped.

-cookie

-Cat!

-cookie

-Cat!

"......."

-Hello!

Ellen regained consciousness to a cry that seemed to call to her.

There was a black cat that had been there forever, pressing its front paws against his thighs.

He looked up at me with a pitying look in his eyes, almost as if he was worried.

Why do this.

Inside the tent, Ellen was sitting in a chair, and she realized that she had lost consciousness, albeit briefly.

I heard there was a meeting about the Serandia campaign.

But Ellen doesn't go to the meetings. She has a voice, and she doesn't take it lightly, but she's never been comfortable discussing issues where so many lives are at stake.

So I was debating whether to go or not.

But when you wake up, your cat, who hasn't been seen in days, is crying in front of you.

Ellen doesn't bother to lock her fortress barracks.

The Royal Class Garrison is heavily guarded, and no one in the garrison is rude enough to enter Ellen's barracks.

So I unlocked the barracks so the cat can come in whenever it wants.

So it comes and goes as it pleases.

-Angel

Ellen clutches the necklace with her left hand and strokes the pitifully crying cat's head with her right.

"I'm fine......."

Ellen now knows that putting her mind to something helps.

I feel like this little being is protecting me.

However, I still have frequent moments of unconsciousness.

"You'll be fine......."

The cat stared up at Ellen, unmoving.

To lose consciousness, to cease to exist.

It's scary, but Ellen has more important things ahead of her.

Serandia Campaign.

Extra-large warp gate.

The fight will get tougher and tougher.

'Reinhard.......'

And of course Ellen knows what the high command knows.

I'm sure Reinhardt will be helping out somewhere in the Serandia assault.

You've been helping, and you're going to help this fight in your own way.

Somewhere.

-Angel

Surely, you're watching yourself.



* * *



Ellen's condition becomes more and more serious.

I knew she was periodically unconscious, and I'd seen her before, albeit in the form of a cat.

Losing consciousness is a bit different.

It's more like someone replacing consciousness.

Eyes as dark as the abyss stare at me. Eyes that I can't tell if they're looking at me or not.

They just stare at you with unfocused, blurry eyes.

I can't read anything but emptiness in those eyes.

It was more than creepy, it was horrifying.

Not only Ellen, but also the people in the Royal Class were feeling very intensely uncomfortable when Ellen was in such a state from time to time.

I don't know why cats help, but Ellen definitely seemed to be affected by it.

I can't quite make out the necklace Ellen is wearing, but I now realize that it serves a similar purpose.

If the condition goes beyond getting worse and becomes irreversible.

Will I now see nothing but Ellen with that vacant stare?

He visits the Royal Class Garrison from time to time to check on Ellen and the status of the Royal Class, but he can't be there all the time.

I'm the one who gets the marching orders, I'm the one who sometimes needs to sleep train Airi, and Charlotte handles Edina's stuff, but I'm the one who gets briefed on the important stuff.

A pet demon.

And just as Ellen is gearing up for a big battle, I'm no different.

For now, we'll focus on the big city, Serandia.

"They're probably marching, thinking we're going to help them."

Senate meeting with all of Edina's key people.

"It's going to be a war of attrition to get through the winter, so I think we're going to have to make that choice."

I nodded at Eleris' answer.

All-out war after a long march in the cold.

After a defensive battle in the freezing cold, it's all-out war in the spring.

Both shoulder a tremendous burden.

In the original game, it's not winter in the first place. It's winter in the other big city campaigns.

In that situation, the Allies take the path of least resistance.

But now she's awakened to a weather-changing ability that she didn't have in the original, and we're here to help.

They will therefore anticipate our help and choose to march.

The path of the Allies is protected by weather, not monsters this time.

That way, they can protect the allied forces from the bitter cold.

But the next problem.

"I guess we'll have to decide what to do when the Serandia attack starts."

Lerouen said.

Yeah, you have to decide that.

The warp gates we've been able to handle in the gate battles so far have been taken down by hitting them before the Alliance.

However, the locations with medium-sized warp gates were left in the hands of the Allies after a first strike wiped out the monsters.

We were tasked with being a vanguard unknown to the Allies, but we had no intention of being on their radar when the main operation began.

But this time, the scale of the operation is different.

One extra-large warp gate and three large warp gates.

There's a limit to how many monsters Riana's weather changes can handle, and even if she does wipe them out, they'll replenish at an alarming rate.

A preemptive strike can have a significant effect.

But if we left this operation in the hands of the Allies, we might succeed in taking Serandia, but we would suffer as many casualties as we would if we didn't fight ourselves.

If we participate, the number of casualties will be fewer, and the Allies will be able to maintain their strength.

It makes sense from a practical standpoint for us to get involved.

"But while we might be able to help in the immediate fight against Serandia, it would likely be a very big mistake in the long run."

"......Yes."

I had to agree with Galarsh.

Antirrhinus opens his mouth.

"Our army may be small, but we're sure to stand out on the battlefield, especially with the large-scale magic wielded by the Lords and Mages of the Clans here. The Thunderbolt that the Thunder King will use, the Divine Power and Tiamata that the Divine Cultist will use, and the Alsbringer that the Great One will use."

The power we use is overly powerful and will inevitably be noticed.

Sarkegaard, who is back in Razak for a meeting, also speaks up.

"Right now, the Allied General Command is aware of our help. The few personnel assigned to frontline reconnaissance missions are kept quiet, and those in the various military commands know that what's going on up front is an Imperial force. Of course, many are aware of suspicious ships, but they don't necessarily mention the Empire or the Alliance."

"But if we show up to this battle, the majority of the Allied forces, especially the common soldiers, will be aware of our involvement, and that could lead to unforeseen problems."

"Your Majesty, I think it's best that we don't show up for the Serandia assault."

Large-scale magic, meteor summoning.

No magic is known to man with such destructive power. The moment you use it, you will recognize the demonic forces at work.

The moment when a meteor rained down from a sky that had turned into a broken mirror and struck the temple was an unforgettable nightmare for those who saw it from the ecliptic. Rumors of its magical powers were not unknown.

Since the gate incident coincided with a meteor shower, the meteors streaking across the sky became a magical symbol of the return of the devil.

If Olivia summons Death Knights to sweep across the battlefield, the Alliance might be spooked by them and try to attack them.

Not to mention Alsbringer.

We would certainly help the Allies if we participated.

There's no point in helping Tina if she's only going to help in a small way, not as a force.

To help properly, many Allied troops will recognize the presence of the demonic forces. Our help could cause the operation to fail.

Seriously, if someone spots me killing a monster in the field and yells, "A demon! and someone screams, what Allied commander isn't going to take that as "a demon attacked the Allies in the middle of a massive air battle"?

Bertus is at a crossroads, faced with the decision to march through the winter in a war of attrition, or to march now at great cost.

I'm no different.

If we help attack Serandia, the Alliance will suffer less damage, but our presence may cause other problems.

If we don't help, we're condoning the deaths of countless people who wouldn't have to die if we did.

That includes the lives of countless people I know.

You'll survive just fine.

I shouldn't let that kind of thinking get in the way of my Serandia exploits.

There is no such thing as an absolutely right choice.

Every choice you make requires you to lose something in exchange for gaining something.

The whole time I've been here, no, the whole time I've been in this world, those have been the only choices I've made.

A choice to gain something and lose something.

We need to do that again.

Bertus and I are already allies, even though we haven't spoken.

But very few people understand that.

To most, I'm still a name of terror, and no one believes in the idea of the devil fighting alongside you.

It's just more confusing.

A demon who caused the Gate Crisis to wipe out humanity helps humanity?

They'll believe it because they're drunk with despair and have lost all sense of reason.

What if the other commanders of the Alliance realize that the Empire has been aided by the Devil all this time?

The end of the Serandia campaign may be the end of the Alliance.

"At some point, we're going to have to fight alongside the Allies, that's for sure."

At my words, everyone in the room goes silent and stares at me.

There will come a time when you'll have to get involved. That doesn't change.

And the gate situation becomes increasingly dangerous.

In the early days of the Gate Crisis, cities with these massive warp gates could be destroyed leisurely with just Saviolin Tana leading the charge. Now that the gates are more dangerous, that's not an option, which is why she's traveling with such a large force.

Serandia is dangerous, but the cities you'll encounter later will be even more dangerous than Serandia.

"Serandia only strikes first, we don't participate, we watch."

No matter who is dying, now is the time to watch them die.

Is it right to turn away from those who are dying right now in order to prevent more deaths?

I don't know.

However, just as Louise von Schwarz did, I make choices.

"And if I could, I'd like to be able to destroy a few warp gates, if not the big ones."

Preemptive strike.

If that's all you can do, you should do everything you can there.
