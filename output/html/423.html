-Kwachang!

Luna's Moonlight Godsword clashed with the blue magic sword summoned by Eleris.

"......!"

But the moonlit sword shattered Eleris's magic sword at the mere touch.

It was hard to accept that she was an Archdemon, but what I did see was that she excelled in melee combat as well as magic.

-Kaang! kang! Keying!

Eleris summons an enchanted sword to duel Ellen's mother.

It's no surprise that Elise is also quite skilled in close combat, but Ellen's mother surpasses even that.

That's not all.

The unusually large moon was not an illusion.

Was it even magic in the first place?

And Xinwaldo, who seemed to have been plucked from the enlarged moon, was shedding a faint glow of cool moonlight.

Most of all, the behavior of Ellen's mother, Luna Artorius, was bizarre.

It was hard to find a way to express it.

Luna Artorius was in human form, but she didn't move like a human.

"......."

She didn't make any of the usual swordplay moves like jumping, lunging, or slashing. Nor did all of her movements seem to have much force behind them.

But with each slow movement, Elise found herself unable to react.

If you attack, you will be hurting Ellen's mother.

But I didn't have to think about it. I knew best that it would be suicidal for me to get involved.

-Bang!

Eleris's summoned magic sword would shatter into pieces every time it met the Moonlight Frosted Sword, forcing Eleris to keep summoning her magic sword.

Elysse struggled to take the seemingly slow blow.

-Bang! Kaang! Kwachang!

For the umpteenth time, Eleris was only too eager to back down.

Eleris' melee prowess, and Luna Artorius' ability to easily surpass it, was a sight to behold.

Slowly but surely, Luna Artorius was attacking with a sense of urgency that seemed to transcend perception.

It's a lot to take in," says Elyse, looking like she's having a hard time keeping her distance.

"I don't know who you are, but....... We don't need to fight."

It was inevitable that Elise would know that Luna Artorius was Ellen's mother.

But Luna shook her head slowly.

"Archdemon. There is no one in the world who wants a fight."

"The last Demon War was not fueled by the desires of demons and humans, but by their mutual fear."

"All fights happen that way."

Luna Artorius, holding the Moonlight Godsword, walks slowly toward Eleris.

"Whatever you want to do is none of my business. It doesn't matter what the Ancestor Devil wanted or tried to do."

"I did not know, and do not know, whether the Ancestral Demon Valier was good or evil, nor do I care to know."

"However, the existence of the demon has caused a great war in the world, and that war culminated in the death of my son."

"Now also I do not know whether you are good or evil. You may be good, and the humans may be evil. Or maybe they're all good, or maybe they're all evil, or maybe my son's action in killing the demon was a consequential evil, but none of this matters."

"The point is, it's not lust and greed that call for a fight, it's fear."

"Just as the Darklands and humans' fear of each other conceived the Demon War and took my son."

"My current fear of the devil will conceive another fight, and this time it may take my daughter from me."

"I don't know what you want, and I don't know what you're trying to achieve by stacking these things. But even if I did, it wouldn't make any difference."

"You are already the very image and symbol of fear, and as long as it exists, you will provoke a fight by your very existence, and that fight will involve my daughter."

"Just as everyone's fight comes from fear, so does mine."

"I am afraid you will take my daughter away from me."

"So, I'm not killing you because of good or evil or righteousness or any of that nonsense. I'm killing you because my daughter is precious."

"It's an act from beyond good and evil, from simple fear."

"As a mother."

"I have one daughter left, and I want to protect her."

It doesn't matter if I'm Ellen's friend or whatever, it doesn't matter what I really want.

Ellen's mother wants to kill me because my mere existence is already the seed of a fight.

No amount of persuasion or sincerity will work.

Luna Artorius speaks, her back to the moonlight.

"So, die."

-shhhh!

Before she could take a step, she was already in front of Eleris, crossing space.

The movement was slow, but the speed through space itself gave Eleris no time to react.

-Bam!

"Hmph!"

After being struck in the chest by the Moonlight Godsword, Elyse bounced away and rolled several times across the floor.

"Hmph....... ugh......."

The barrier seemed to have somehow escaped her, but Eleris gasped several times as she clutched at her chest.

"Kwak! Kwak!"

Covering her mouth, Elise coughed up blood.

The sword didn't pierce him, but the impact alone seemed to break his body.

Once again, Luna Artorius takes a step forward.

If she crosses the space again.

Eleris dies.

Can I?

I?

Can I stop her?

A million thoughts jumbled and tangled in my head, but I acted faster than I thought.

-Bam!

In the next moment, I had already summoned Alsbringer and attacked before Luna Artorius could take a step.

She narrowed her brow at the sight of the sword in my hand, even as I lunged in with a tremendous amount of momentum, only to be deflected.

"......alsbringer?"

For the first time, a look appeared on her face.

Luna Artorius does not know me. But he may have heard of me from Ellen.

Ellen would have told her mother what kind of a guy I was.

You may have also heard that I am the owner of Tiamata.

And he knew that I was known to the world as the master of Alsbringer.

Luna Artorius's expression hardened as she pieced together the puzzle of her thoughts.

"Are you sure....... you're Reinhard......?"

It was clear that it would be impossible for a holy object to withstand the new moonlight, so I had no choice but to take it out.

It was never good for me for her to know I was Reinhardt.

"My daughter, is that what you've been playing with?"

Naturally, this is the reaction you're bound to get.

She's been moving slowly until now, and then her eyes light up and she bounces her knee off the ground toward me.

-shhhh!

"!"

-Bam!

"Eek......!"

A single blow.

I broke my wrist just enduring it, and the Alsbringer slipped out of my hand.

"Did you enjoy that, Archdemon?"

Luna Artorius's eyes lit up with life.

I've been playing with Ellen's mind, you can't help but think.

If Ellen realized that the Reinhardt of whom she spoke was actually the Devil, her thoughts could only boil down to this.

So Luna Artorius, who tried to kill me without emotion, was feeling anger.

The Alsbringer slips from my grasp and my chest heaves. Whether she plunges her sword in or twists my throat, the next moment I'm dead.

I die, and so does Elise.

He comes to capture Cantus Magna, only to be killed by Ellen's mother.

But I wonder if it was a good thing I provoked her anger.

-Bam!

"Cr......gh!"

She grabs me by the nape of the neck with her left hand and lifts me into the air. Her eyes bore into mine with fury.

The moonlight sword in her right hand flashed a dangerous light.

"Archdemon, why are you playing with my daughter's mind?"

She glared at me. If she tightened her grip, I would snap my neck. No enchantments, no words, no self-suggestions.

At least as good as, if not better than, Saviolin Tana.

This absolute could treat my life like a fly right now.

"Is this your revenge? What did you hope to gain by tormenting the mind of the brother of the man who killed your father? Is this your revenge, this lowly act?"

She can't help but think so.

The son of the devil meeting and getting close to the sister of a warrior is something that even she, as a novice, can't understand.

Luna Artorius, who seems to have lost her humanity, is trying to kill me because she can't let go of her parental humanity.

So now that I know the truth about my relationship with Ellen, which is bound to be very hurtful to her, I can't help but think, "I'm sorry.

That everything I do is for revenge.

"Did you take pleasure in imagining the hurt my daughter will feel when she learns of this later? Will you think you have won, even if you die here and now at my hands, because you can grieve my daughter with your death? Why on earth. Why not the Empire, why not the Imperium, why not humanity, why not my daughter....... Why to my daughter......!"

-cook

"Speak, Archdemon."

As the anger in her eyes grew, as if she was losing control of her emotions, so did the strength in her left hand, which was clasped around the nape of my neck.

Plural.

I'm not a vengeful person.

Actually, it can't be plural.

That's why there's as much wild suspicion as anger in Luna Artorius's eyes.

In the throes of breathlessness, the pain of being cut off.

I pulled my broken hand up close and grasped her hand, which was clasped around the nape of my neck.

"Then why not......?"

Why not?

This can't be revenge.

You don't understand my behavior either.

"Can I....... your daughter some....... If you like....... Can't......?"

"......what?"

Then what.

In the end, it was just for the love of it.

I mean, that's the only reason it's so slick.

Luna Artorius's grip on me weakened as I realized how surprised she was by my words.

I cry out, desperately tugging at her grasp.

"Yeah....... I'm the devil and I like your daughter, so what!"

"Uh....... Huh?"

Following the anger, I could see the bewilderment on Luna Artorius' face.
