"Holy shit....... Fucking asshole......."

Bertus gritted his teeth when he heard Olivia Ranze's story.

Reinhardt didn't tell the world that he was a demon, because it would have turned into a religious issue.

It was dangerous to leave Olivia alone when she might be the devil's pawn.

So it was best to keep Olivia under observation for now.

However, when Olivia Ranze found out the truth, she began her shenanigans.

"You're not even hiding your intentions to side with the devil."

First and foremost, Olivia's willingness to bide her time was too obvious when she started talking about the Inquisition and discussions.

It was clear that I was not going to stay ambiguous, but I was going to defend the devil.

Olivia Ranze has chosen to become an enemy of the Empire, if not of humanity.

"Kill?"

Bertus gritted his teeth at Scotra Kelton's report.

"I can kill it, but it's in the middle of the temple, and it's going to be impossible to do it without a fuss, and it's going to be a mess."

The General Headquarters is one of the centers of the Temple.

From there, a fight breaks out between Olivia Ranze and the knights of Chanapelle who are trying to kill her, and an unspecified number of people can't help but notice.

Olivia Ranze is even harder to kill than the Devil at this point.

The Crusader Knights and the Grand Master would be held accountable for the Empire's murder of Tuan's champion, and would be bitterly resented by the majority of Grand Master adherents.

It's too long to say that she actually sided with the devil and had to be killed.

People will only accept the simple truth: 'The Empire killed the Champion of Tuan.

Olivia Ranze knows the political and religious significance of her life.

Killing me will bring about a conflict between the Empire and the Cult of the Lord long before the death of the Demon King.

And the devil has not one, but two holy relics.

So it's a matter of religion before it's a matter of empire. So you can't keep the disposition of the devil to yourselves.

The Five Great Houses have far too much incentive to get involved in this case.

If left alone, Olivia will escape the Temple on her own and make her way to the Crusaders.

Then, Olivia Ranze will lead a large group of paladins to knock on the Temple's door. Let's discuss the treatment of the demon.

It's up to us to decide whether to kill the demon or save it.

Killing demons is no fun, and Olivia Ranze will threaten the Empire.

The real big accidents happen to honest assholes, Bertus had once told Reinhardt in his own words.

That's what I said when evaluating Olivia Ranze.

Crazy asshole trying to scream at whales to stop killing demons in front of humans.

Olivia Ranze.

It's just an excuse to say you're a great teacher.

This asshole is not on the Church's side, only the Devil's. He doesn't even try to hide it.

The logic should be clear.

Not one, but two holy relics.

If two of the five gods chose the Demon, then the Demon must be right. Instead of hating each other, let us all find a way to live together, and we will create bullshit with no hypocrisy, only the intention of saving the demon.

"Really....... I'm going to die......."

You can't kill it, you can't not kill it.

When the Empire begins to meddle in matters that they've tried to keep to themselves, the situation spirals out of control.

First and foremost, Olivia Ranze wants to make sure the Demon King doesn't die.

This would cause great confusion among the populace, so they would try to spread rumors among the civilian population that Reinhardt, a known warrior, was a demon.

Bertus felt like he was watching a dragon struggle to wreak havoc on an empire.

"Call Elion Bolton at....... for me."

"......May I?"

"What the hell. I'd rather see the Empire split in two by killing Olivia Lance, than have the Demon King's list grow a little longer. No, I'd rather have her alive to wage war against the demons, a thousand times better, because then the empire will be stronger, not weaker."

I'm getting tired.

For days, Bertus felt like he was being pushed to the limits of his mental capacity.



* * *



Elayon Bolton has entered the Temple with an entourage due to Olivia Ranze's troubles.

Olivia Ranze is about to reveal information that should be strictly confidential, information that would wreak havoc on the world if it became public.

There is a demon who has been chosen by a holy object.

Humans.

What do you think about that?

Olivia was about to summon the leader of the Crusader Knights to speak with her when Elayon Bolton arrived.

"What's going on, Olivia?"

"Let's get out of here."

Now that she had someone to take her out, Olivia had no intention of staying locked up any longer.

"Miss Olivia! No!"

Shanapelle's knight, who had been watching Olivia, stood in her way.

"You need to stay here to talk. You can't leave."

With the Shanapelle knights refusing to give way, the Crusader leader and his entourage realized something was amiss.

The Crusaders knew something was going on in the Temple, but they had no idea what it was.

"Who are you to tell me what to do?"

Olivia smiled wickedly as she stepped in front of the knight.

"The Empire is not responsible for my welfare, the Crusaders and the Great Houses are. Templars? Fuck that. The Empire has no authority to dictate where I go or where I come."

"......."

"Blocking my path will be seen as a challenge to the Crusader Order and an act of anti-religion against the will of the Five Great Houses and their members across the continent."

Olivia says calmly.

"Get out of my way. Where the fuck are you standing in the way of a champion?"

I wasn't alone, the leader of the Crusaders was with me.

It's not Olivia's personal power, it's her symbolism and political standing.

As such, Chanapelle had no choice but to pave the way.

Every knight in Shanapelle watched in horror as Olivia Ranze walked out with a bomb that would shake the entire continent.



* * *



Olivia Ranze explained the situation to Crusader Knight Commander Elayon Bolton.

Originally, he only had Alsbringer, but Reinhardt communicated that he was sharing Tiamata with Olivia.

Reinhardt with two picks for the Holy Grail.

And that Reinhardt is the devil.

So, we need to convene the papal hierarchy of the Five Great Patriarchs for an emergency meeting. A doctrinal conference, an inquisition, whatever.

Elion Bolton was understandably alarmed.

That should have been enough of a message.

I've left it to Elion Bolton to take care of things for the Order.

The idea of a demon being the owner of a holy object would be a huge shock to the entire Shinto community.

Priests and paladins will also be divided on this issue.

That's why Olivia started acting before the decision was made.

That was easy for Olivia.

In the main building of the Crusaders, he held a makeshift sermon that drew priests and worshippers.

It was a sermon from a champion of Tuan, so it was bound to be well attended.

Olivia didn't say much.

"The gods are always right. Right?"

At Olivia's blunt words, many in the room nodded.

"The gods arrange and plan everything, don't they?"

"So the gods' choice cannot be wrong, cannot be denied, and the grace they bestow upon us is in itself proof that they are right and a sign that they love us."

"It is clear, then, that beings favored by the gods are worthy of love, and that their existence should be affirmed. Just as we are the chosen ones, loved by the gods."

"The most powerful of such graces and proofs."

"Holy Grail."

Olivia summoned Tiamata in her right hand and held it high.

-Ooooo.......

The subtle holy light flowing from Tiamata overwhelmed some who gazed upon it, moved others, and touched others with the grace of knowing it.

"As the chosen one of these holy objects, I dare say I represent the will of the gods to some degree."

"Ladies and gentlemen, the demon that has caused such a stir is now being held in the Temple."

-Oh!

The words caused a very loud rumble in the hall. At a time when the name of the Demon King was feared by all, the news that he had been captured was enough to fill everyone with awe, admiration, and relief.

"Reinhardt, the new warrior, whom you may have heard of."

Olivia smiles.

"They say that the warrior, chosen by the war god Als, is actually a demon who has infiltrated the human world."

No wonder the admiration in the room turned to disbelief. Seeing everyone's stunned silence, Olivia continues.

"We don't know all the details yet. But the point is, even if he is a demon disguised as a warrior, it doesn't change the fact that he was chosen by Alsbringer."

The sudden onslaught of information was so overwhelming that the listeners of the sermon were dazed.

But it definitely sticks in your head.

A demon has infiltrated Inseo.

With the name Reinhardt.

And he was chosen by Als.

"Of course, it's also possible that the Devil has done some nefarious trick to earn Alsbringer's favor."

Evil tricks.

People who were confused by the all-encompassing word have regained some semblance of sanity.

It's also something Olivia shouldn't say when she's trying to save Rheinheit.

But that's the point.

"As to whether the Demon King was truly chosen by Als, the Crusader Knights and the Order of the Five Great Houses have a duty to prove it."

"Right now, the Demon King's recruits are in the hands of the Empire."

"But that's our problem."

"The duty and right to discuss and conclude that the Demon has been chosen by the gods and to determine his treatment rests with us, not the Empire."

"It is we, not the Empire, who must decide whether the Devil has been chosen by the holy relic, or whether, through dirty tricks, he has intercepted a sacred relic that should belong to someone else."

"From now on, I will be traveling to the temple to receive the Devil's recruits."

"I believe that it is my divinely ordained duty to determine whether the devil has been denied or pacified."

"In the name of the Great Lord."

"In the name of Tuan, god of purity."

"I, in the name of God, will judge whether he is virtuous or not."

A political maneuver to get the Devil's recruits delivered.

Olivia Ranze is starting to make a big splash.

An unspecified number of people take the seeds of chaos.

These will now germinate everywhere and wreak havoc.



* * *



Olivia didn't just assert that the demon must be right because it was chosen by a holy object.

Such extreme claims are bound to provoke a moderate backlash.

It is true that the devil has been chosen by the relic. Therefore, there must be a discussion to determine whether it is right or wrong, and we must be the ones to lead that discussion.

Olivia's comment about making it our problem because it's our problem seemed like the right thing to do.

The congregation was confused, but Olivia prioritized action.

Olivia Ranze, who left the temple, returned about five hours later.

She wasn't alone.

She was accompanied by two hundred paladins, some of the finest of the Crusader Order.

The paladins were also in a bad mood.

The paladins were initially shocked that the demon had chosen the holy object, but they were also angry that the Empire had tried to do this in secret.

The paladins all agreed with Olivia Ranze that we should be the ones to judge the demon's recruits.

In front of the guards and shanafels blocking the Temple's entrance, Olivia stepped to the front of the group.

"You are fulfilling a sacred duty. Make way."

"The Temple is Imperial property, not a place where the Crusaders can drop in and out as they please."

"The gods created this continent, and all the land is in their favor. Since all lands belong to the Great Lords, there is no land that we, the enforcers of their commands, cannot go to."

Olivia spoke like liquid gold, as if she'd never decided to betray the gods.

"You are interfering in a religious matter of great importance to the Crusader Knights and the Five Great Houses. Step aside, and we will discuss the disposition of the Demon King."

"I keep telling you, you can't come in."

"I'll take that to mean it's okay to use force."

-Thwack!

Olivia menacingly drew the tiamaata she had purposely kept in her scabbard.

The paladins looked nervous as Olivia drew her sword, and they drew theirs cautiously.

The paladins were also nervous about Olivia's behavior.

Tuan's champion, Olivia Ranze, is crossing the line.

Combine that with the Temple's forces, and things could spiral out of control. Whether Olivia's actions are right or wrong, she's officially brought the Great Patriarchate and the Empire into conflict.

The stabbing at the entrance to this temple may even be remembered as the start of a religious war.

That's why the Temple's guards, and even the paladins who followed her, were weary of Olivia Lance's honest madness.

Because no one thought she would go this far.

"Champion. For more information, visit......."

As such, one of the paladins who followed Olivia gulped and almost tried to discourage her.

"Now, are you doubting my meaning?"

To go against my will is to go against Tuan's will.

Even if I were a fellow Crusader, do you think I wouldn't have my head blown off against my will, Olivia asked, her eyes telling me so.

Olivia Ranze was now showing the Champion of the Gods just how crazy she could get, and the logic she could use to turn things around.

The Great Unwashed.

Holy Grail.

Congregational turmoil and religious wars.

Give it to me.

They're just pretending to be.

This could lead to a religious war that would tear the Empire apart, or it could be the beginning of a great war and carnage that would shake the entire continent.

Olivia doesn't know any of that.

The world.

Humanity or whatever.

Whether you're screwed or not is none of Olivia's business.

Olivia Ranze tries to save Reinhardt.

So, he'll get rid of what's in his way.

Even if it's God himself.

"Get out of the way, if you don't want to go to war."

Olivia's murderous words caused the guards and the paladins who followed her to hold their breath.

Honest insanity.

The worst thing it could show was about to happen, and it was happening now.
