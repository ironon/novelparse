After Herriot returned, Bertus sat in his office, contemplating.

The demon looked like he'd rather die.

He said this could lead to bigger problems.

Why?

Wouldn't it be better to use Akasha to survive?

Why the devil.

Pretending to care about humanity.

It destroyed their world, killed their father, and if Valier truly died for that purpose, then Valier must hate humanity.

The Devil has no reason to care about the well-being of humanity.

There is nothing like that level of forgiveness and reconciliation in the world.

Balie's statement that he wants peace is therefore necessarily false.

In fact, it's entirely possible that everything you hear about Akasha is a lie.

To kill the devil or not to kill the devil.

Once Akasha is in the hands of the Devil's minions, and they attempt to use it to recapture the Devil, some unforeseen disaster is bound to occur.

Akasha is used by the Devil's minions to reclaim the Devil.

So, if you kill the Demon, will his minions, who have lost hope, not use Akasha?

It can't be.

If things go that way, Akasha will be used to avenge the dead demon.

In any case, Akasha is used.

There is only one way for Akasha not to be used, and that is to release the demon.

But what if an unleashed demon uses Akasha to destroy the world?

That's the worst possible ending for humanity.

If the stories about Akasha are true.

It's also true that I lost my memory and didn't know anything until now.

It's also true that we know the future.

And it's also true that there's this huge catastrophe with the gate thing or whatever.

Is it also true that the Devil was trying to stop it for the good of humanity?

It's too much to ask to believe such a lie.

The Devil has built up so many lies over the years that we can't trust anything he says in this situation.

Should the demon be killed, spared, or set free?

Bertus felt lost, at a crossroads where nothing could be the right answer.



* * *



Olivia Ranze has returned to the ecliptic.

It's been a long time coming, and we're just about to wrap up our investigation of the Demon Gods.

In the southern part of the continent, in the Gelkorgis Desert, a number of cities that had become so desertified that their inhabitants had abandoned them, were strongholds of the cult.

With a vast area of desert uncharted territory, it was only natural that the headquarters of the Demon Gods would be located in a place where ordinary people couldn't go.

Olivia's immense divine power was an identification card and a ticket in itself.

Olivia's original intention was to kill the Demon King that the cultists were following, should he ever show himself.

But the demigods knew nothing about the demon king. They had no real contact with the Demon, except to say that he represented the will of the gods.

Knowing that they were merely followers of the Demon Lord, they could only hope that the last attack on Raziern by the Demon Cultists was not the work of the Demon Lord.

Killing the demon directly was out of the question, so Olivia decided to do the next best thing.

A complete wipeout of the cultists, who may turn to the devil's side at any moment.

It was something she couldn't do alone, so Olivia returned to the ecliptic.

I was going to lead the main body of the Crusader Knights and wipe the desert of Gelkorgis clean.

This was a good time to do it, as the situation would be even more troublesome once the demon had made full contact with the cultists.

On her return to Huangdao, Olivia encountered something strange.

"Olivia Ranze, follow me for a moment."

Before Olivia could reach the Crusader headquarters, Imperial knights blocked her path.



* * *



Olivia was led into the Temple by the Knights, not by the Crusaders' headquarters.

I had come to the temple to catch a glimpse of Reinhardt's face, so it didn't change the fact that I had come to the right place, but it felt a little strange to be dragged there.

And Olivia felt a little weird.

Of course, it's the times they are a-changin', but the atmosphere inside the temple seemed overly rigid.

Most of the people coming and going were not students, and there were more armed troops than usual.

The knights and wizards escorting Olivia didn't look like anything out of the ordinary, either.

Inside the temple, in a counseling room in the General Headquarters.

I couldn't help but feel like I'd been dragged into an interrogation room, and soon someone entered.

A knight of Shanapelle, whom I had seen during the raid on Rizaira. Scotra Kelton sat down in front of Olivia.

"I told him not to use coercive means, but I'm not sure how that went."

Olivia stared at the stern-faced, middle-aged driver.

"It wasn't coercive, but....... What? Did I do something wrong?"

The strange atmosphere made Olivia blunt.

Now that you've pinpointed the location of the cultists, you've done no wrong and have done the Empire a great favor. Of course, we haven't seen it yet.

At Olivia's words, Scotra Kelton shook her head.

"No, that's not true at all, we trust her, but due to some important facts that have recently come to light, she needs a lot of attention and care."

"Important facts?"

"......."

Scotra Kelton stares at Olivia for a moment.

Like you're pondering something deeply.

"Ms. Olivia, would you like to summon Tiamata?"

"......?"

As if she could do anything, Olivia summoned Tiamata and set her down on the table.

"You are sharing Tiamata with Mr. Reinhardt, is that true?"

Scotra Kelton saw Olivia holding and wielding a tiara that should have belonged to Reinhardt during the Lizaira incident.

"Yeah, you saw that."

Olivia narrowed her eyes, as if to ask why she should know. Scotra Kelton nodded stiffly at Olivia's reaction, which was slowly becoming more than a little irritated.

"Mr. Reinhardt turns out to be a demon."

"Is that ......?"

Olivia couldn't help but panic as she suddenly heard something that didn't make sense.

What did I just hear?

Even when I thought about it word by word, I couldn't figure out what I had just heard.

But Scotra Kelton didn't elaborate.

"Therefore, Miss Olivia, who is soul-bound to the devil, must be judged as a person of interest."

"No, I'm asking you what you're talking about!"

"Ms. Olivia, I believe you are innocent, but....... I am recommending that you stay here at the General Headquarters until the situation has calmed down."

"What......?"

"Please, Ms. Olivia....... We don't want to do this either."

Scotra Kelton left the consultation room.

Olivia froze, unsure of what the hell was going on.



* * *



Olivia soon left the counseling room and was led by the knights to one of the staff quarters in the General Headquarters.

It was like a horse's imprisonment. It wasn't just Olivia who lived in the quarters, but Shanapelle's knights as well.

It was clear they were watching in real time.

"What, I'm not supposed to know what's what, I'm supposed to know the context, and what am I supposed to do if you just throw out Reinhardt as the devil?"

It's not Scotra Kelton who's being kept under guard, but a member of the Knights of Shanapelle, the Empire's most powerful knightly order.

So it was clear that there had to be someone who could take out Olivia in a pinch, and it wouldn't be just one person.

The Knight of Shanapelle stares at Olivia with a stern expression.

"Quite literally, Olivia. Reinhardt, the holder of Alsbringer and Tiamata, was a demon who infiltrated the Temple, which was recently discovered and is currently imprisoned within the Temple, and discussions are currently underway to determine his treatment."

It was a longer explanation than Scotra Kelton's, but Olivia still couldn't make sense of it.

"And in light of the fact that Miss Olivia was rescued by demonic forces during the last death of Leviathan Lance, but has kept that fact a secret until now, and that you are sharing Tiamata with a demon, albeit of your own volition, the Empire has deemed it necessary to keep an eye on her."

"......."

"Miss Olivia, if you can just behave yourself for a few days, everything will be fine."

After all, it's possible that Olivia isn't the Devil's Kinnapool, but the Empire wants to keep her under surveillance because of the possibility.

Until the demon's disposition is determined.

Olivia swallowed hard.

Something.

It was clear that something very strange was going on, and most of it didn't even make sense to Olivia.

But one sentence stuck in my head.

Reinhardt was the devil.

So you're bound to be suspicious of yourself sharing a tiara with a demon.

Also, that he was present at the time of the murder of Levi Lance, but has kept it a secret until now.

That's why they're suspected of being in cahoots with the devil.

Olivia could only guess at how she got there.

"Reinhardt is....... Demon......?"

The single truth.

Once she accepts that, all the scattered puzzles that have been complicating Olivia's life come together.

That day, Olivia couldn't understand the demon's behavior, and it bothered her.

Why it saved me.

He was going to kill Leviathan, but he saved himself, an outsider. Why?

Why would raiding a nameless order do anything but good for the empire?

Olivia has been confused all this time because she doesn't know the demon's true intentions.

But Reinhardt was the devil.

If so, everything makes sense.

To protect yourself.

There was no other reason than that.

Somehow, Reinhardt knew Olivia was in danger, which is why he led his forces to attack Leverier Ranze.

The nameless order meant nothing to him, nor did Levereer Ranché itself.

It was a story where Olivia and Adriana were in danger and I only saved them because they were in danger.

The final piece of the puzzle was put together.

Demon and Reinhardt.

If they were the same, I could understand and accept the whole situation.

If the attack on Raziern by the Demonists was the work of the Devil, then the Devil must be evil, or so I thought.

But Olivia now realizes that the Satanists don't actually have much to do with the Devil.

Not selected.

Reinhardt won't look at me.

Always looking elsewhere.

I tell you how much I care about you, but you always turn me away.

That sucks.

That's what I was thinking.

It wasn't.

Reinhardt has already saved himself by taking a very big risk.

It was the same the first time, and it was the same this time.

Reinhardt redeemed himself twice.

"......."

What was it about you that said I'd do anything for you, even when you weren't looking at me.

I'm on your side, even if you don't choose me.

Unbeknownst to her, Reinhardt had already saved her. Risking his life, he mobilized a small force to take on the elite Paladins.

I even risked being found out.

While she verbally vowed to save Reinhardt, he actually saved Olivia, and hasn't been the least bit shy about it since.

On that subject, I was getting a little nervous.

I've been cringing at the subject.

On that subject, I whined about not being seen.

Olivia stood frozen, her mouth agape.

What a shame.

How ridiculous.

How I felt bad for myself every time I grumbled.

I would have been devastated because I wouldn't have been able to reveal the truth.

When Olivia realizes what Reinhardt has sacrificed for her, she realizes that Reinhardt is the devil and that it's probably a good thing.

If anything, it hardened Olivia's heart as the incomprehensible began to make sense.

What he said then.

From there, one part is now untenable.

Because Reinhardt was the devil.

The devil can't hurt Reinhardt.

No matter what.

Even if the world is upside down.

Even if the world is trying to hurt you.

No matter what.

I decided to keep Reinhardt.

The world wants to kill Reinhardt, the devil.

"......."

Therefore, Olivia must protect him. Olivia stares at the silent knight of Shanapelle.

She was staring at Olivia.

The Empire is suspicious of Olivia. She might be on the Devil's side.

Not until now.

Olivia is neither human nor demonic, but only Reinhardt's side.

Reinhardt is trapped somewhere in the temple.

We don't know why, but the Empire isn't going to kill him right away.

A few days of grace.

But for now, Olivia can't get away from Knight Chanapelle and the watchful eyes that have been placed on her.

So they can't break through Reinhardt's cage, which is sure to be more heavily guarded.

It will be a dog's death.

I could risk my life for Reinhardt, but I didn't want to take the chance that neither he nor I would die.

You have to put your life on the line for something that has even the slightest chance of working.

You can't save Reinhardt alone.

If so, you're not alone.

Reinhardt.

Just make sure you're not alone.

"Summon the Crusader Captain."

"......Yes?"

At Olivia's words, Knight Shanapelle of the Watchtower shook his head.

"As the Champion of Tuan and the one responsible for the future of the Five Great Houses, I must report this matter to the Houses and talk to them about their response and position on this situation... now."

"Miss Olivia, what are you talking about......."

"You are not detaining a Temple student. You're exerting political pressure on the Champion of Tuan, who represents the will of the High Priestess."

"What are you talking about, Miss Olivia. This is....... problem, isn't it?"

"He's the chosen champion of Als and Tuan, and we're going to have to do some doctrinal interpretation and inquisition about that, and we're going to have to get all the great houses of worship together to talk about whether there's any sense in the gods choosing him, or whether there's some nefarious machinations involved."

Olivia wants to politicize this work.

It's not about humanity vs. demons.

It's a matter of gods and men.

"You can silence me, but you'll have to bear in mind that keeping me here will cause a great deal of discord between the Empire and the Church of the Lord later on."

If you do not allow me to report this to the Church, you may have to go to war with us in the future.

"So get me a crusader, before I try to get out of here on my own two feet."

that I will make it so.

Olivia was saying it with her eyes.

"And I can't take on all of you. If you think you can't get away with anything......."

Olivia stares out the window, a sour look on her face.

"That's a big miscalculation."

Olivia smiles grimly and looks at the fading knight of Charnapelle.

In her confinement, Olivia was threatening her opponent in reverse.

"Holy shit....... Fucking asshole......."

Bertus gritted his teeth when he heard Olivia Ranze's story.

Reinhardt didn't tell the world that he was a demon, because it would have turned into a religious issue.

It was dangerous to leave Olivia alone when she might be the devil's pawn.

So it was best to keep Olivia under observation for now.

However, when Olivia Ranze found out the truth, she began her shenanigans.

"You're not even hiding your intentions to side with the devil."

First and foremost, Olivia's willingness to bide her time was too obvious when she started talking about the Inquisition and discussions.

It was clear that I was not going to stay ambiguous, but I was going to defend the devil.

Olivia Ranze has chosen to become an enemy of the Empire, if not of humanity.

"Kill?"

Bertus gritted his teeth at Scotra Kelton's report.

"I can kill it, but it's in the middle of the temple, and it's going to be impossible to do it without a fuss, and it's going to be a mess."

The General Headquarters is one of the centers of the Temple.

From there, a fight breaks out between Olivia Ranze and the knights of Chanapelle who are trying to kill her, and an unspecified number of people can't help but notice.

Olivia Ranze is even harder to kill than the Devil at this point.

The Crusader Knights and the Grand Master would be held accountable for the Empire's murder of Tuan's champion, and would be bitterly resented by the majority of Grand Master adherents.

It's too long to say that she actually sided with the devil and had to be killed.

People will only accept the simple truth: 'The Empire killed the Champion of Tuan.

Olivia Ranze knows the political and religious significance of her life.

Killing me will bring about a conflict between the Empire and the Cult of the Lord long before the death of the Demon King.

And the devil has not one, but two holy relics.

So it's a matter of religion before it's a matter of empire. So you can't keep the disposition of the devil to yourselves.

The Five Great Houses have far too much incentive to get involved in this case.

If left alone, Olivia will escape the Temple on her own and make her way to the Crusaders.

Then, Olivia Ranze will lead a large group of paladins to knock on the Temple's door. Let's discuss the treatment of the demon.

It's up to us to decide whether to kill the demon or save it.

Killing demons is no fun, and Olivia Ranze will threaten the Empire.

The real big accidents happen to honest assholes, Bertus had once told Reinhardt in his own words.

That's what I said when evaluating Olivia Ranze.

Crazy asshole trying to scream at whales to stop killing demons in front of humans.

Olivia Ranze.

It's just an excuse to say you're a great teacher.

This asshole is not on the Church's side, only the Devil's. He doesn't even try to hide it.

The logic should be clear.

Not one, but two holy relics.

If two of the five gods chose the Demon, then the Demon must be right. Instead of hating each other, let us all find a way to live together, and we will create bullshit with no hypocrisy, only the intention of saving the demon.

"Really....... I'm going to die......."

You can't kill it, you can't not kill it.

When the Empire begins to meddle in matters that they've tried to keep to themselves, the situation spirals out of control.

First and foremost, Olivia Ranze wants to make sure the Demon King doesn't die.

This would cause great confusion among the populace, so they would try to spread rumors among the civilian population that Reinhardt, a known warrior, was a demon.

Bertus felt like he was watching a dragon struggle to wreak havoc on an empire.

"Call Elion Bolton at....... for me."

"......May I?"

"What the hell. I'd rather see the Empire split in two by killing Olivia Lance, than have the Demon King's list grow a little longer. No, I'd rather have her alive to wage war against the demons, a thousand times better, because then the empire will be stronger, not weaker."

I'm getting tired.

For days, Bertus felt like he was being pushed to the limits of his mental capacity.



* * *



Elayon Bolton has entered the Temple with an entourage due to Olivia Ranze's troubles.

Olivia Ranze is about to reveal information that should be strictly confidential, information that would wreak havoc on the world if it became public.

There is a demon who has been chosen by a holy object.

Humans.

What do you think about that?

Olivia was about to summon the leader of the Crusader Knights to speak with her when Elayon Bolton arrived.

"What's going on, Olivia?"

"Let's get out of here."

Now that she had someone to take her out, Olivia had no intention of staying locked up any longer.

"Miss Olivia! No!"

Shanapelle's knight, who had been watching Olivia, stood in her way.

"You need to stay here to talk. You can't leave."

With the Shanapelle knights refusing to give way, the Crusader leader and his entourage realized something was amiss.

The Crusaders knew something was going on in the Temple, but they had no idea what it was.

"Who are you to tell me what to do?"

Olivia smiled wickedly as she stepped in front of the knight.

"The Empire is not responsible for my welfare, the Crusaders and the Great Houses are. Templars? Fuck that. The Empire has no authority to dictate where I go or where I come."

"......."

"Blocking my path will be seen as a challenge to the Crusader Order and an act of anti-religion against the will of the Five Great Houses and their members across the continent."

Olivia says calmly.

"Get out of my way. Where the fuck are you standing in the way of a champion?"

I wasn't alone, the leader of the Crusaders was with me.

It's not Olivia's personal power, it's her symbolism and political standing.

As such, Chanapelle had no choice but to pave the way.

Every knight in Shanapelle watched in horror as Olivia Ranze walked out with a bomb that would shake the entire continent.



* * *



Olivia Ranze explained the situation to Crusader Knight Commander Elayon Bolton.

Originally, he only had Alsbringer, but Reinhardt communicated that he was sharing Tiamata with Olivia.

Reinhardt with two picks for the Holy Grail.

And that Reinhardt is the devil.

So, we need to convene the papal hierarchy of the Five Great Patriarchs for an emergency meeting. A doctrinal conference, an inquisition, whatever.

Elion Bolton was understandably alarmed.

That should have been enough of a message.

I've left it to Elion Bolton to take care of things for the Order.

The idea of a demon being the owner of a holy object would be a huge shock to the entire Shinto community.

Priests and paladins will also be divided on this issue.

That's why Olivia started acting before the decision was made.

That was easy for Olivia.

In the main building of the Crusaders, he held a makeshift sermon that drew priests and worshippers.

It was a sermon from a champion of Tuan, so it was bound to be well attended.

Olivia didn't say much.

"The gods are always right. Right?"

At Olivia's blunt words, many in the room nodded.

"The gods arrange and plan everything, don't they?"

"So the gods' choice cannot be wrong, cannot be denied, and the grace they bestow upon us is in itself proof that they are right and a sign that they love us."

"It is clear, then, that beings favored by the gods are worthy of love, and that their existence should be affirmed. Just as we are the chosen ones, loved by the gods."

"The most powerful of such graces and proofs."

"Holy Grail."

Olivia summoned Tiamata in her right hand and held it high.

-Ooooo.......

The subtle holy light flowing from Tiamata overwhelmed some who gazed upon it, moved others, and touched others with the grace of knowing it.

"As the chosen one of these holy objects, I dare say I represent the will of the gods to some degree."

"Ladies and gentlemen, the demon that has caused such a stir is now being held in the Temple."

-Oh!

The words caused a very loud rumble in the hall. At a time when the name of the Demon King was feared by all, the news that he had been captured was enough to fill everyone with awe, admiration, and relief.

"Reinhardt, the new warrior, whom you may have heard of."

Olivia smiles.

"They say that the warrior, chosen by the war god Als, is actually a demon who has infiltrated the human world."

No wonder the admiration in the room turned to disbelief. Seeing everyone's stunned silence, Olivia continues.

"We don't know all the details yet. But the point is, even if he is a demon disguised as a warrior, it doesn't change the fact that he was chosen by Alsbringer."

The sudden onslaught of information was so overwhelming that the listeners of the sermon were dazed.

But it definitely sticks in your head.

A demon has infiltrated Inseo.

With the name Reinhardt.

And he was chosen by Als.

"Of course, it's also possible that the Devil has done some nefarious trick to earn Alsbringer's favor."

Evil tricks.

People who were confused by the all-encompassing word have regained some semblance of sanity.

It's also something Olivia shouldn't say when she's trying to save Rheinheit.

But that's the point.

"As to whether the Demon King was truly chosen by Als, the Crusader Knights and the Order of the Five Great Houses have a duty to prove it."

"Right now, the Demon King's recruits are in the hands of the Empire."

"But that's our problem."

"The duty and right to discuss and conclude that the Demon has been chosen by the gods and to determine his treatment rests with us, not the Empire."

"It is we, not the Empire, who must decide whether the Devil has been chosen by the holy relic, or whether, through dirty tricks, he has intercepted a sacred relic that should belong to someone else."

"From now on, I will be traveling to the temple to receive the Devil's recruits."

"I believe that it is my divinely ordained duty to determine whether the devil has been denied or pacified."

"In the name of the Great Lord."

"In the name of Tuan, god of purity."

"I, in the name of God, will judge whether he is virtuous or not."

A political maneuver to get the Devil's recruits delivered.

Olivia Ranze is starting to make a big splash.

An unspecified number of people take the seeds of chaos.

These will now germinate everywhere and wreak havoc.



* * *



Olivia didn't just assert that the demon must be right because it was chosen by a holy object.

Such extreme claims are bound to provoke a moderate backlash.

It is true that the devil has been chosen by the relic. Therefore, there must be a discussion to determine whether it is right or wrong, and we must be the ones to lead that discussion.

Olivia's comment about making it our problem because it's our problem seemed like the right thing to do.

The congregation was confused, but Olivia prioritized action.

Olivia Ranze, who left the temple, returned about five hours later.

She wasn't alone.

She was accompanied by two hundred paladins, some of the finest of the Crusader Order.

The paladins were also in a bad mood.

The paladins were initially shocked that the demon had chosen the holy object, but they were also angry that the Empire had tried to do this in secret.

The paladins all agreed with Olivia Ranze that we should be the ones to judge the demon's recruits.

In front of the guards and shanafels blocking the Temple's entrance, Olivia stepped to the front of the group.

"You are fulfilling a sacred duty. Make way."

"The Temple is Imperial property, not a place where the Crusaders can drop in and out as they please."

"The gods created this continent, and all the land is in their favor. Since all lands belong to the Great Lords, there is no land that we, the enforcers of their commands, cannot go to."

Olivia spoke like liquid gold, as if she'd never decided to betray the gods.

"You are interfering in a religious matter of great importance to the Crusader Knights and the Five Great Houses. Step aside, and we will discuss the disposition of the Demon King."

"I keep telling you, you can't come in."

"I'll take that to mean it's okay to use force."

-Thwack!

Olivia menacingly drew the tiamaata she had purposely kept in her scabbard.

The paladins looked nervous as Olivia drew her sword, and they drew theirs cautiously.

The paladins were also nervous about Olivia's behavior.

Tuan's champion, Olivia Ranze, is crossing the line.

Combine that with the Temple's forces, and things could spiral out of control. Whether Olivia's actions are right or wrong, she's officially brought the Great Patriarchate and the Empire into conflict.

The stabbing at the entrance to this temple may even be remembered as the start of a religious war.

That's why the Temple's guards, and even the paladins who followed her, were weary of Olivia Lance's honest madness.

Because no one thought she would go this far.

"Champion. For more information, visit......."

As such, one of the paladins who followed Olivia gulped and almost tried to discourage her.

"Now, are you doubting my meaning?"

To go against my will is to go against Tuan's will.

Even if I were a fellow Crusader, do you think I wouldn't have my head blown off against my will, Olivia asked, her eyes telling me so.

Olivia Ranze was now showing the Champion of the Gods just how crazy she could get, and the logic she could use to turn things around.

The Great Unwashed.

Holy Grail.

Congregational turmoil and religious wars.

Give it to me.

They're just pretending to be.

This could lead to a religious war that would tear the Empire apart, or it could be the beginning of a great war and carnage that would shake the entire continent.

Olivia doesn't know any of that.

The world.

Humanity or whatever.

Whether you're screwed or not is none of Olivia's business.

Olivia Ranze tries to save Reinhardt.

So, he'll get rid of what's in his way.

Even if it's God himself.

"Get out of the way, if you don't want to go to war."

Olivia's murderous words caused the guards and the paladins who followed her to hold their breath.

Honest insanity.

The worst thing it could show was about to happen, and it was happening now.
