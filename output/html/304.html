"No, your superpowers are stronger and now you have to move your clothes with you? Seriously, why does life have to be so twisted all the time?"

"......I don't know. How do I know that?"

The more Riana held his stomach and laughed, the more his face rotted. Luckily, Contestant 40 was able to return the clothes to the Royal Class students, and Kono Lint was able to get dressed and out on the streets again.

He didn't want to win, he just wanted the time to pass quickly, so he could go back to his dorm and get some rest with a fresh mind.

It was a horrible experience, but it's over.

Or was it just bad memories?

Someone who doesn't even believe in themselves, but then beams as they tell you they do.

That trust, even with the eventual penalty, is what made the new ability work once and for all.

Who's where.

I don't really want to do anything, but it would be nice to know that much at least.

At the very least, we can be friends.

The girl's-no, the boy's-hand, briefly grasped to move him, was strangely soft.

In the waiting room, I got nervous and bit my nails, which turned out to be unsightly, but they were as soft as the hand I was holding.

Kono Lint shook his head vigorously as the strange thoughts continued to overwhelm him, as if trying to get rid of them that way.

"...... What's wrong with him?"

Riana even took a few steps back, as if the cono lint had gone a bit too far.

"Uh, isn't that him?"

Kaier pointed as if he had spotted something, and there was what appeared to be a girl, though not a silver-haired girl in a hoop dress.

I could only see the back of his head, but surely the only other person dressed like that today was Contestant 40. Erich looked at him and nodded.

"Right."

"......What do you think is going on?"

Heinrich shook his head at the sight.

Standing in front of the two-meter behemoth was Participant 40, who was much shorter than him, while a group of giggling, pretentious-looking people surrounded him.

-.......

-.......

It's not close enough to hear what you're talking about.

However, no matter how you look at it, all you can see is a picture of him and a group of people harassing and threatening participant #40.

Everyone realizes that this is a guy who used to compete in cross-dressing competitions. The sight of a man of his size in a dress was quite shocking and memorable.

Riana smiles, the corners of her mouth turning up at an angle.

"Huh, are the boys bullying the poor little girl?"

It was a weird thing to say, and we all looked at each other in disbelief, but from a distance, it was true.

You don't know what's going on, but you're in trouble.

"This sister needs to be saved."

When Riana is about to go to the rescue of a poor little boy who is obviously in trouble.

"......I'm just going to?"

"......?"

One side of the encircling group opened up, and the silver-haired boy jerked his head at Geohan, then abruptly went on his way.

I don't know what's going on, but they just seem to let me go. They even say hello, so it's like they're grateful for something, right?

"What the hell."

"You're lucky if nothing happens......."

Riana bit her lip, glad that nothing had happened. Riana watched as the big boy stared at Number 40 as he stalked away.

"Anyway, sinful man, that."

Riana giggled at the sight, as if it were too funny.

"By the way, I was wondering what she's majoring in after all, and where her classes are......."

Riana said, and then fell silent.

The group that seemed to be harassing me 40 times let me go as if they weren't. It must have been a misunderstanding. But Riana gestured toward 40, who was getting further and further away.

A little further back than that, to be exact.

"Hey, that."

"That?"

"Hey, isn't that the guy who was at the convention earlier?"

Where Riana pointed, someone in a black robe was walking still behind Number 40.

"Something like....... looks like."

Erhi had seen those creepy black robes before, and he knew what Riana was talking about.

Someone in a black robe, who looked suspicious enough, was indeed following 40. Everyone's expression turned serious at Riana's words.

"I don't know what it is, but isn't he a little dangerous?"

A mysterious assailant is chasing Number 40. Riana and the other Royal Class students think something is going to happen to him.

"Let's follow along."

"Wee, isn't that dangerous......?"

Kaeir said, a little peeved. I wonder if I'm getting myself into trouble.

"Is this the time for that?"

Surprisingly, it wasn't Riana who said it, but Kono Lint.



* * *



Tailed.

And this time, I was sure it wouldn't be a simple pervert like the middle-aged dude from earlier.

At the convention, everyone was looking at me, but I clearly saw the guy in the black robe at the very back of the room, staring at me.

It was a little off-putting, but there are a lot of guys like that, so I let it go, and now he's following me.

What are you trying to do to me?

I have to take off my dress and remove my makeup, and a strange man is chasing me.

It's not following me fast, but it's definitely closing the distance. He can't do me any harm on the sidewalk, but I want to get back to the road!

I even went out onto the main street and blended into the crowd in an attempt to get away, but my black-robed pursuer was still following me within a certain distance.

I could have told the guards that I was being followed by a weirdo, but I didn't want to get in trouble.

I turned into the alleyway, wondering why I was going through this.

Follow him out of the temple. He returns to the dormitory as Reinhardt.

Just as I was thinking that, I turned the next corner in the alley.

"!"

"......."

Behind me, the black-robed thug appeared before my eyes.

This guy is dangerous.

Scarily, I already had my fist outstretched.

-Whoosh!

But my fist slammed into thin air, and the robed thug shrugged off my straight with a nod of his head.

Its movements are out of the ordinary. My sudden attack didn't deter the creature from attacking me.

"......I'm just reaching out to you because I think you're done with your work, Reinhard, and I have no intention of attacking you."

"!"

The words seemed to freeze my brain.

Know me.

No one noticed me.

"You, who are you?"

Despite my adversary's slurred voice, he remained calm.

"You should have known that Order would be contacting me soon."

Black order.

They said they'd be in touch soon.

If.

That happened to be today.

It wasn't just freezing, it was like being hit with a sledgehammer.

No, no.......

Why.

Why today?

Not to Ellen, not to Bertus, not to Harriet. Not to any of his dorm mates.

But in a weird way.

My cross-dressing has been discovered by a magical associate who is neither an enemy nor an ally, with whom I will be discussing big things in the future.

"Uh, since when have I seen....... since when? Oh, no, how did I get to....... in the first place?"

"I looked at the participant list. Entry number 40, Reinhardt."

Damn, you saw that. How did you know I was going to a cross-dressing contest?

I mean, it's a black order, it's not exactly classified, but they can just go through the list and find it, and it's okay?

The Black Order member stared at me through his black robes.

"You know, like....... This, this. I have my own reasons......."

This one has a story!

I can't really say, but it's a story!

"I have no interest in your personal preferences."

However, rather than respecting my taste, the salesperson dismissed me as if he didn't care.

The man I assumed was going to do something nasty to me actually didn't care what I looked like.

I'm trying to make excuses for this, but I don't give a shit about it.

Me, not so much. As far as they're concerned, I'm a pretty big deal with a road vampire as my henchman, and I thought it was a little unreliable for a guy like that to be traveling around like this.

"We don't care about how well you dress, we care about how much valuable information you have for us."

This attitude that it doesn't matter.......

This.

That's weirdly hurtful.......

Ellen's no slouch either.

Is the Black Order a group of extreme douchebags, or is it just this guy.......

I wasn't sure if it was because it was a festival, or if it was actually no big deal to infiltrate the temple.

Whether or not I was teetering on the edge of embarrassment and crisis, the Black Order member had his say.

"You said you needed knowledge of the Order, and you said you could give us information on the Cantus Magna. Is that correct?"

"...... did."

It's so embarrassing to talk like this, and I feel like I'm the weirdo because the other person doesn't care.

"What knowledge do I need?"

Dealing with the Black Order.

That's where this bizarre timing comes in.

Are they really unrelated to the gate situation? I don't know. But we have to find out somehow.

No time for pranks, and no time for embarrassment.

"How to Open a Portal to the Otherworld."

"......."

He didn't answer my question, didn't ask why I wanted to know, just watched me in silence.

"Do you know?"

"You asked what knowledge we need, not that we would provide it. If you have something of value to offer, we will share knowledge in return."

"So, are you admitting that you have some knowledge worth sharing?"

You don't need to know how to do it specifically.

The fact that the Black Order can tell me how to do that is proof enough for me. Give me the information about Cantus Magna, and I'll tell you how to open the portal to the other world. The moment they say that, the Black Order becomes an organization capable of causing the Gate.

I don't want to know how.

Whether you guys know it or not, that's all I need to know.

"I can't answer that."

However, the Black Order was not without its challenges.

"Then the deal is so unfair. If I give you information about Cantus Magna, you might not be able to give me what I want. Why should I make such a deal?"

There is no reason to make a trade where one party loses. Just making sure that we both have a hand is my goal.

"Do you have any reliable information about Cantus Magna?"

"Well?"

"Does this mean the information is not ready?"

The settlement agent's mood changed; he looked a little angry.

"It's like you can't tell me yet whether your knowledge is ready or not."

"......."

Neither he nor I were displaying any animosity or aggression toward each other.

"We'll discuss this and get back to you."

After all, it's not something you can decide from the line in front of you.

"......."

"Until then, we hope to have information on Cantus Magna ready for you."

"What if I'm not ready?"

"I don't think you're the kind of guy who would play games with us."

At the end of the day, we both knew what we wanted, but nothing was really exchanged.

However, the Black Order didn't say they didn't know.

It seemed like there was a glimmer of hope for resolving the gate situation.

My heart was beating like crazy.

This won't solve all your problems, but it's another one.

You're over one of the biggest hurdles.

The Black Order didn't seem to wonder about my intentions at all, just that a deal is a deal when the parties are ready for each other.

"At the appropriate time, we'll come back to you......."

-Bang!

"......."

Just as the conversation was coming to a close, a lightning bolt suddenly flashed out of thin air and landed on the underside of his right cheek.

But the light was interrupted by a flash of protective magic.

Suddenly, what?

"Pretty girl, come here!"

I turned around and there they were, the Royal Class guys from the cross-dressing contest with Liana de Granz and Kono Lint, watching me.

Why did they come all the way out here? But by the looks on their faces, I knew what they were thinking.

What's wrong with you, pretty boy? What's wrong with you?

Riana exclaims, her face turning white.

"Quick!"

Riana called out to me urgently, and the settler looked at me and nodded subtly, as if he knew what was going on.

Is it a signal to go.

You're a dumbass, but you seem to have a point.

"Yes, yes!"

I scrambled to Riana's side, and she squeezed my hand, her eyes lighting up at the sight of the black-robed member of the Order.

"What are you, a wizard?"

"......."

"I don't know what you're up to, but what the hell are you doing in the temple, get out of here!"

-Pajik!

A light flashed near Riana's hair. As if to say, if you try anything foolish, I'll blow you away.

Oh, no.......

I don't care who you are, you shouldn't be arguing with a Black Order member.

Lucky for me.

"Hmm, that's too bad."

The Black Order member suddenly started playing kidnapper and backed away.

"I'll see you next time, pretty boy."

"......."

That.

Was that a tease?

I don't know if he was acting or teasing me, but he slowly backed away, turned, and disappeared.

Riana looked at me as the black robes disappeared and asked with concern.

"Are you okay? Did something happen to you?"

"Oh, that....... Yeah, yeah, yeah....... Nothing happened......."

No.......

You didn't have to come.......

"Uh-oh, so you're not going back fast enough, what were you doing? I mean, I tried to get away from you, but you can't just walk into an alley like this, you idiot. Where do you live? I'll take you home."

"Oh....... No, that. That's a nice......."

The long, dirty day ended with Riana's fumble.
