I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have worked as well if I had come alone.

Everyone here knew about Olivia Lanze.

"Oh, this is Reinhardt, a freshman who is a superpowered junior with a very exciting future."

"Psychic?"

"This junior had a vision and created a place called the Magical Research Society."

"Ho-ho, what are they working on?"

"Ms. Olivia, it's an honor to meet you."

"Haha, hello. I'm Reinhardt, a freshman......."

People wanted to get a word in with Olivia Lanchester, who was now famous in a different sense, and Olivia introduced me like a sales pitch. I emphasized my magical research organization and the need for substantial funding.

While the attendance from the four major organizations was stellar, the competition was just as strong.

They were high-ranking nobles from the imperial states, as well as members of the imperial aristocracy and other organizations.

Olivia talked to them all, and introduced me to them.

But as Olivia expected, the results weren't great.

"Oh, that's great, I'm rooting for you, Reinhardt."

"Then maybe you could donate to......."

"Ah, but more than that, Ms. Olivia. What are you thinking about after graduation?"

He'd rather have Olivia on board than sponsor the Magical Research Society, which Olivia had brought up.

Olivia Ranze was a star in the sky when she was supposed to join the Crusaders. But now that she's not joining the Crusaders, she's a huge commodity on the free agent market.

The magical society took a backseat, and it was clear that everyone was trying to get Olivia involved in some way.

But when I realized that Olivia's intention was not to find a career, but to get sponsorship for a club her juniors had started, I stopped paying attention.

Even though I coveted the super-sized property, I knew that the intention of the sale was to help a kid build a ridiculous invention.

The vice-president of the Magic Association, a man named Sangtriden, was baffled.

"Mmmm....... It's good to dream big, Mr. Reinhardt."

I felt a little sorry for them. There was no point in telling me that my teammate was an untapped genius.

"That's not working."

Olivia scratched her cheek, a little embarrassed.

"It's not that they can't come, it's that they have no reason to come."

"Yeah, that's right......."

Being here has made me realize something.

It's a scouting ground and a place to sponsor talent that's close to graduation.

Obviously, the shorter the sponsorship period, the better. It's more cost-effective to sponsor a student closer to graduation than it is to sponsor a first-year student until they graduate.

Therefore, the best candidates for sponsorship are grades 5 and 6. For younger grades, it's inefficient to be here for too long to sponsor.

Their purpose is to create a connection in the name of sponsorship, to scout or solicit.

I'm a freshman, and I'm trying to build something that sounds silly.

Graduation is a long way off, and plans are unclear.

People aren't going to sponsor you.

Similar to investments, sponsorships were hard to come by.

Still, I didn't expect to be treated so poorly, and I'm lucky that Olivia is the only one who can talk to me.

"But I'll take it as far as I can."

Even if people's interest waned, I decided to keep moving, because one of them might get it.

The only one who wasn't interested in us from the start.

Olivia and I went to the Merchant Guild Master, Owen de Getmora.

When I thought of the Merchant Alliance Guildmaster, I envisioned a middle-aged man who had aged quite nicely. I wonder if he'd be as dignified in this position.

In a corner of the ballroom, he was alone, sipping champagne and observing the proceedings.

He didn't talk to anyone.

He didn't look like a merchant.

"Hmmm, you sound like you're dreaming up some really great invention."

It was clear that he didn't think my research work was worth talking about.

"By the way, I didn't expect to see Mr. Reinhardt here."

He seemed more interested in me than in the magical society.

I had some idea why he was doing it. A business that opens a store in each subway station. The Merchants Guild is a major investor in the project. With the way things are going, he's bound to know about me and the Rotary Club.

There was a connection between the Merchant Guild Master and myself that was completely separate from the Magical Research Society.

Olivia shook her head, not quite sure why, but it didn't make the mood any less odd.

He had no interest in Olivia. He didn't run a group that required force.

"Mr. Reinhardt, may I ask you a question?"

"Yes."

So he sees me.

It seems to be interested in me.

I'm the only one who cares about me, a condition that everyone else in this room has no choice but to ignore.

"Why do you think I'm here?"

"Are you asking me to guess the intent of ......?"

"Yes."

He sees me.

Out-of-the-blue questions.

What the heck is the point of getting this right?

The stranger tests me.

The Merchant Guild Master, Owen de Getmora, is qualitatively different from the Thieves Guild Master. While the Merchants' Guild has dabbled in a few illegal businesses, they are ultimately a benign organization.

He is the leader of a group whose very existence is at odds with that of the Thieves' Guild, which is being eradicated. Perhaps that's why he's able to take a seat at such a prestigious table.

Money is the envy of no other group.

"Here's a hint: I'm not looking to scout anyone, and I'm not looking to sponsor anyone."

It's like he's testing my insight. Passing this test is not a guarantee that he will sponsor me.

I just want to know.

Who your critical business partners are.

But at some point you're going to have to be able to talk to someone who doesn't look down on you for your age.

I'm not interested in scouting, I'm not interested in sponsorship.

So why is it here?

If they just want to come, there's no reason to ask this question. It's an inferential question, of course.

Let's think about the results.

The role of a Merchant Guild Master is all about making money.

You're saying that attending a sponsored event is a paycheck in itself.

When I thought about it, it wasn't a hard question.

This is where the big names come together.

"I can't think of a better place to get a feel for the state of the continent."

"A little more?"

"I can see the need, and consequently, I can see what they're lacking."

People come from all over the world, from all over the empire.

And they make moves to include talent. When you know their needs, you know their deficiencies.

The Knights need to replenish their arsenal, so look for strong people.

The money they invest is a reflection of their deficiencies and needs. What do they need over there, what do they lack over there.

You can tell what they want by reading the back and forth conversations.

This gives us some idea of the strength, needs, and finances of the group.

Owen de Getmora is a merchant.

One who prepares things to fulfill people's needs and desires.

He heard my short answer and smiled.

"That's great."

"Maybe, but I don't know what the Merchant Guild is going to do with the information that comes out of it."

Owen said it was great, but Olivia was looking at me with her mouth hanging open.

No.

What are you so impressed with this?

"Then we should probably talk about the next one."

"If you're talking about......."

"I wasn't going to sponsor, but I didn't expect Mr. Reinhardt to come."

He sees me.

"I have to sponsor Mr. Reinhardt, and I have to do it now, and can you guess why?"

The backers here prefer to give to upperclassmen.

However, the Merchant Guild Master feels that he should sponsor me because I'm a lower ranked player.

That wasn't a hard problem either.

"I think you're looking for my value while I'm at Temple, not after I graduate."

"That's even better."

Owen sipped his champagne with a satisfied smile.

Owen de Getmora realizes that his magic train shop business is backed by the imperial family.

You want to put your foot down on my imperial ties.

I don't want Reinhardt, I want a classmate of the prince and princess.

If so, my value arises now while I'm at Temple, not after I graduate, so he wants to create a connection to the imperial family by sponsoring me.

I'm the kind of guy who could win an imperial franchise.

"Mr. Reinhardt, how much do you need?"

It asks for a price tag engraved with my name.

Too much and you'll look ridiculous, too little and you'll look shallow.

I'm dealing with an older man I've never met before today. I don't know how to do that.

But you have to do it.

You don't say it, but you're trading ties to the imperial family. Mentioning it is blasphemy.

"Well, I don't think that's up to me."

He's asking for my price list, but I change the product to something I'd describe as an edginess.

You're trading relationships with the imperial family, and I can't put a price on that.

So you weigh in, how much do you think your ties to the imperial family are worth?

Owen de Getmora smirked at me.

"Well, you've hit the nail on the head, and we'll send you the right amount of money in a timely manner."

He is a trader.

In the end, he didn't say how much he was going to pay.

But if the amount is ridiculously low, the Merchant Guild will get a kick out of it.

A deal that promises intangible consideration.

Gave nothing and received something.

But it was also pretty scary.

There would come a time when I would have to give them something, and I wouldn't know what to give them.

You can go and say, "I don't know," but these are traders.

If you're a merchant, you're going to get paid somehow.
