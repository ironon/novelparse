            Episode 335.





It's been a week since school started.

Herriot had almost stamped in at the Imperial Ministry of Magic for his research on dimensional magic. I didn't visit the Magical Research Council too often, as I knew I'd only get in the way if I checked in on them.

Elise has left the ecliptic.

According to the Rotary Club, the Vampire Council would be meeting a week from now. Elise would be back in time, and if she went to the Rotary Club around that date, she could attend the Vampire Council meeting.

Five vampire families.

If you can get them to cooperate, you've got a goldmine.

We need to win their power, whether through intimidation or persuasion, and it remains to be seen if that will be possible.

We don't know how to persuade and intimidate those who didn't cooperate in the Demon War.

The Black Order will be in contact with you again, and you should be prepared to extract information about Cantus Magna in order to negotiate with them.

If you can't get that information from the Vampire Council, you may have to do something crazy like use sobriety to lure out the Cantus Magna.

We were also gaining some sensitivity to the gate event through information about the warp gate itself.

Charlotte's brooch is already a clue.

Passing through the Ecliptic Warp Gate with the Brooch Artifact activated will take you to the Warp Gate in the basement of the Palace of Spring.

The exact process is unknown.

Importantly, magical technology already exists that can interfere with the warp gate system.

Of course, this is an authorized artifact.

The important thing is that we've gotten the information that no matter how the warp gate has set up its path, there are magical techniques that can interfere with it.

The existence of Charlotte's artifact had already suggested one possibility.

So.

This is where I started to really get into the world-saving stuff.

My head feels like it's going to explode, I don't have time to think, and there's a good chance I'll be found out, not to mention the consequences could be life or death.

Of course, there were a lot of little things along the way.

-Kang! Kagak!

"Whoa."

"Not bad."

After sharing the sword with Olivia, I hung it in its cradle with a tingling sensation in my grip.

Without Ellen, I have no one to practice swordsmanship with. As a result, I'm practicing swordsmanship with Olivia in the training center.

I could play Cliffman, but after all, he hasn't awakened his Enchantment yet, so he's not someone I can go all out against.

Of course, if you go to Savior Tana, she'll be happy to teach you swordsmanship, but you're better off focusing on teaching Ludwig.

So now I was practicing swordplay with Olivia.

Olivia flicks her training sword around and slings it over her shoulder.

It wasn't until this tournament that I really realized how good Olivia was. Until then, Olivia hadn't said anything to me about teaching me swordsmanship.

Of course, when I asked, he said, "Sure, why not?" and came to the stage.

Olivia's skill set is clearly immense.

Neither the power and stability of the enchantments nor the skill of the swordsmanship itself can compare to mine.

I put all my energy into my moods, self-suggestion, and enchantments, but I felt like I couldn't keep up.

I couldn't help but realize that it was a combination of achievement points, words, and circumstantial luck that allowed me to kill Reverie Ranze.

"Shall we try again?"

"Sure."

Olivia looks at me, her sword raised, her eyes serene.

I pull out my training sword again and start energizing.

-Quack! Card gain!

Olivia lunges at me in a panic, thrusting my dueling swords roughly.

"Gap!"

-side!

"!"

My chest flaps open as I push my sword away, and instantly Olivia is there, hugging the nape of my neck and kissing my cheek.

"Oh, come on. Can you please not do this?"

"If you don't like it, are you stronger than me?"

All good.

It was a problem because it did some crazy things sometimes.



* * *



After a long struggle, I collapsed to the floor of the smokehouse, almost sagging.

While my stamina is much better than it used to be, I still feel a bit more drained when I'm fighting with my Enchantments.

Burnout in a slightly different sense than exhaustion.

The good news is that I've noticed very little damage to my magic circuitry from using Magic Enhancement. Besides the increase in pure power, I already have two talents for manipulating and sensitizing power to begin with.

If you don't get used to it quickly, it's weird.

"You're a wimp, Reinhardt."

"...... is weird, this."

"Wouldn't it be nice to be especially weird in a royal class full of weird kids?"

"I guess that's true."

Olivia, squatting next to me on the practice floor, poked me in the cheek.

"You said he went down to his hometown."

"Yes."

"Chet, you really need to realize that you're being too hard on me."

I was at a loss for words when she pointed out that she was looking for me because Ellen wasn't there.

"You must be sorry, seeing as how you can't say anything."

Olivia would say that, but she didn't sound very angry or argumentative.

Olivia has a lot to be sorry for.

Still.

They don't know that I risked so much to save Olivia and Adriana. I don't want them to know.

I guess I'm not a very nice person, though. I'd like to forget about it gracefully, but that doesn't work.

I'm kind of pissed off that I can't make a face with this, I'm not going to say it, but this whole situation of not being able to make a face is just pissing me off!

You took a risk for your sister that's barely above getting busted at a cross-dressing contest. If you're feeling sorry for me, you're not alone. This!

"Reinhardt."

"It's ......."

"Did you do this?"

"Is that ......?"

What's that?

Are we on to something?

There's no way Olivia would have any evidence or clue that I'm a demon.

Olivia smiles sadly at me, seeing the look on my face like I'm having a brain freeze.

"The nursery school I used to sponsor....... The director and the teachers....... were taken away."

"......a."

The thief's got me.

I was talking about something else entirely, which is weird because there's a lot of poking and prodding.

Yeah, that's what I did.

I couldn't tell the Emperor, but I did tell Charlotte that things had worked out for me in terms of getting Eleris out of harm's way, and I asked her to help me with the problem with the nursery.

I already knew about the orphanages that Olivia was personally sponsoring, and I thought it was weird that they were poor when they couldn't be poor.

It was only a few days ago, and Charlotte seemed to have acted on it immediately. Olivia seems to have noticed, too.

Olivia looks at me with a sad expression.

"Did you....... did, right?"

"Yes."

"......."

I was hoping Olivia wouldn't find out, but in the end, she can't help but find out.

"We already do a lot of work with war orphans in the ecliptic, so it just didn't make sense to me that there were orphanages with financial problems."

Olivia didn't look pleased. She couldn't possibly be happy.

The children may have a better life with more care, but Olivia has been betrayed by the people she trusted.

Olivia slumped to the floor of the training center.

"I didn't think they'd do it. I never even suspected it. I didn't think any human being would do something like ....... that kind of money in the middle."

Trust in humans.

Trust in human goodness.

There was such humanity in Olivia. After being disappointed in religion and faith, I wondered if Olivia was now disappointed in people.

Olivia was silent for a moment, then spoke up.

"The funeral is being held today."

"If it's a funeral......."

"Yes, my foster father."

Libertarian Lance.

His death is a big deal, not only for the religious community, but for the empire itself.

The death of a war hero is a war hero's death, no matter how you slice it. Even those who died in battle against demons.

So whatever the story behind it and whatever issues are actually involved, on the surface, his death is a very unfortunate event for the public. And so, now that the dust has settled, a funeral is being held to mourn the passing of Levereer Lance.

"Reinhard, can you go somewhere with me for a minute?"

I couldn't refuse Olivia's request.



* * *



I couldn't feel it inside the temple, but I could tell that the funeral of Leverier Lancet was a state funeral. Every house on the street had black flags as a sign of condolence, and there were vendors selling flowers on the street.

The funeral procession would make its way from the abandoned monastery where the body was recovered to the Crusader headquarters.

At the southern edge of the ecliptic, a funeral procession was entering and the road to the Crusader Legion was being controlled by guards.

-Maybe this is good.......

-Looks like a bunch of demons to kill.......

Many of the people who gathered to watch the funeral procession would have been followers of the Five Great Patriarchs, while others would have been civilians grieving the death of a war hero.

The hatred of demons and the fear of demigods were widespread among the people.

It doesn't matter why Leviathan was in that place, on that date, at that time.

People believed that Leviathan had died in a fierce battle with demonic remnants, which was eventually true.

You just don't know the story behind it.

No one knows the true story of Leviathan Lance, who blackmailed his foster daughter to regain his usurped power, and ultimately tried to work with the devil himself when his life was in danger to divide the empire.

Olivia would be thrilled with this situation.

You're safe, thanks to the demons' attack.

It's hard to accept that Leviathan Lance, the man who blackmailed Adriana for her life, is now a hero in death.

At the mouth of the road to the south, a grand funeral procession emerged.

Paladins and priests escorted the funeral procession.

Dozens of ornately decorated coffins followed the wagons they pulled. These were the coffins of Leviathan Rancher, his paladins, and the unnamed members of the Order.

Leveri Lance was decapitated by me. I don't know what happened to his body, torn and broken by Loyaar, bursting and burning with magic.

I don't know what the opinion of the entire Crusader Order is, but I can see Elayon Bolton leading the procession from the vanguard on his white horse.

Neither the Empire nor Elion Bolton would be happy with this situation.

Nevertheless, for the sake of the grief of the ignorant citizens, he feigns sorrow and leads the funeral procession with a solemn expression.

When the funeral procession appeared, there were many people crying about what was so sad.

-Aigoo!

The tears that began to spread, starting with a few cries, were quite strange.

They don't know Libertarian Lance.

But I don't know why they are so sad, even tearful, over the death. I don't know if it's because they're religious or not.

But I have no right to question their tears.

I'm the most inhuman person in the room.

Whether or not they deserved to die, I'm a crazy person for attending the funerals of people I killed.

There were quite a few people who weren't crying in the midst of the mourners.

But the people who weren't crying looked a little troubled.

I was fidgeting like a sinner for not crying.

Tears are like involuntary muscles.

Unless you've practiced, you can't cry just because you want to cry. Tears come down, not up.

Olivia watched with a calm gaze as the funeral procession drew closer and closer.

"Reinhardt."

"Yes."

"I think this whole thing is so disgusting. Am I too bad?"

Olivia says as she watches the coffin that will contain their bodies approach.

All of this is just for show, after all.

People don't know what they need to know. They're only doing it because it's a good picture to make a hero out of a dead Leviathan.

Olivia hates Leviathan, but she also hates this situation where her death is being used against her.

From all of this, Olivia is disgusted.

"I think we can do that."

Olivia shakes her head at my words.

As the funeral procession gradually approached and began to enter through the boulevards of the southern part of the ecliptic, the surroundings became noisier with the wailing of the people.

Led by Elayon Bolton, they will make their way to the Crusader headquarters. Flowers will be thrown and tears will be shed by those who have gathered to watch the long, long procession.

We were watching the spectacle.

-me, over there.......

-Saint over there....... No?

-If you were a saint,......?

-You're the boss's daughter!

I've been watching for too long.

Olivia was a recognizable face.

So there were enough people who recognized Olivia.

In a sea of tears, someone waved to Olivia, and in an instant, all eyes were on her.

Saint of Eredian.

He's the guy who made Libertarian Lance disappear, but people don't care about that right now.

A former Crusader Knight Commander and war hero who died honorably while fighting demons.

It was important for his daughter to be here.

-Saint Iago!

"......."

Olivia's expression hardened, and in an instant, the crowd around us began to crowd around her and me.

"Oh holy saint, maybe this is good, maybe this is good!"

"You have to get revenge on those dirty, ugly demons!"

"In honor of your father, you must lead the fight against demons!"

"Oh saint, I'm so scared I can't live!"

"Saint!"

"A saint must save us!"

"How can I do this when the warrior is not here!"

The neighborhood quickly turned into chaos.

As if Olivia were some kind of god, countless people knelt before her and cried out.

They don't know why Levereer Ranze disappeared, nor do they know that Olivia has abandoned her faith.

The devil is back.

However, there are no more warriors.

Someone has to stand up to the devil.

Someone else, not me, someone else who is great and brave and good and powerful.

May you defeat the devil for me.

People want it.

-We must defeat the devil, saint!

-Saint!

-Aigo! Saint, save us!

They don't know what Olivia is really capable of.

You may only know that she had very powerful divine powers and was a saint.

A lot of people think they're kings.

Seeing them on their knees, begging, telling them to die in their place.

Seeing so many people openly begging to sacrifice for us.

I watched as Olivia's eyes lost focus.

Olivia was feeling overwhelmed.

Restore Your Faith He suffered in the midst of a crowd of bullies.

I've seen the abhorrent behavior of people willing to take the lives of others for their own use, and I've seen their deaths celebrated.

Teachers were stealing the donations we had been squeezing out of our pockets.

Beyond issues of faith and religion.

Now, in a place that has nothing to do with faith and religion, I see people crying out and openly asking to die in their place.

Watching people try to nonchalantly push someone to their death with tears as a shield.

Olivia felt like something important had been broken, something that was all that was left of her heart.

"Why would I?"

Olivia's voice was emotionless and cold.

"Why would I do that?"

Olivia, broken.
