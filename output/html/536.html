            Episode 536.





A few days ago.

Louise von Schwarz found the emperor.

It was to protest what was surely the final blow to the tense atmosphere between the Schwarz royals.

"Your Majesty, you seem to be taking an inordinate interest in the affairs of the House of Schwarz.

"It's happening in one of the Allied hubs, so I shouldn't be interested.

Imperial Emperor Bertus de Gradias.

Some emperors excel in wartime, others in peacetime.

Louise von Schwarz doesn't know which Emperor Bertus is more capable at any given time.

I wouldn't say the empire is alive and well, but it's still breathing.

The surviving imperial powers were able to band together and form a coalition.

"I'm sure you don't realize that the mere mention of the House of Gradias on such a sensitive subject is a grave insult to the Schwarz family.

The Empire is clearly the superior power, but Cernstadt is not to be trifled with.

If Cernstadt were to leave the Alliance right now, the Allies would lose about a third of their power. The importance of Cernstadt to the Alliance is enormous.

It is a grave diplomatic breach and a mistake for the Emperor to speak to the House of Schwarz and suggest that your youngest prince is illegitimate, even if he did so in private and not in public.

Under Louise von Schwarz's cold gaze, Bertus could only smile, as he always did.

"Why don't I know that it's better to stay put?

'.......'

Bastardization issues.

It's in your best interest to ignore it.

'If I stayed put, Heinrich would be assassinated by his ugly brothers, who couldn't get over their jealousy and inferiority complex, and I'd have the chance to use that as an opportunity to wipe out the Schwarzes, who had always been an eyesore and a nuisance to the Empire.

'It's going to be a lot of noise, but there's a cause at stake here, a war for the fate of humanity. The Alliance may falter, but it won't collapse, because we're fighting a war for a reason.

'We're trading Heinrich von Schwarz's life for the life of the Schwarz family, who clearly want to overthrow the Empire more than anyone. Wouldn't it be better for you to remain silent and let everything take care of itself?'

Louise's expression hardened even more at Bertus' harsh words, which didn't match his smiling face.

Silence would allow Cernstadt to fall by itself, and in the confusion, Bertus could capture and kill the Schwarzes in the name of the cause and then devour the entire Cernstadt army.

There will be tremendous pushback from the Cernstadt forces, but this war is for the greater good, not self-interest.

Bertus knows that the Alliance will be greatly disrupted, but not destroyed.

Cernstadt, which may be the biggest post-war contender, will fall on its own. There's no reason not to watch.

"What, are, you, saying, now?

'I didn't commit this diplomatic faux pas because I was up to no good, I did it because I didn't want to see my friend die....... and that was the only reason.

It was just a matter of letting it happen.

Bertus didn't have to say anything to Heinrich, who came to him.

Heinrich was an important power, but if he could trade the future of the empire for one life, he should do so.

But that's not what Bertus did.

Heinrich didn't give me a direct answer, but he did give me some truth.

Not all the truth, but some of the truth.

'Because I know now, on some level, that if you don't treat your friends well, terrible things happen.

Ruiz couldn't understand Bertus' unintelligible addition.

But if we leave it alone, Heinrich will be killed.

Louise gritted her teeth at that.

'You seem pretty confident that that's going to happen, do you think that kind of nonsense is going to happen?'

'Your two brothers are worse greats than you realize.'

A trust named Brother.

No, not even that.

Trust in humanity itself.

In a situation like this, with a fight on the horizon, he becomes jealous of his illegitimate son who is better than him and tries to assassinate him.

Louise couldn't understand how something so stupid and ridiculous could happen.

They have more rights than anyone else, so they should have more responsibilities than anyone else.

The belief that they wouldn't do something so irresponsible.

Louise von Schwarz doesn't think that's possible.

I don't think my brothers would be that stupid.

I'm not expecting much, but I don't think it's going to be much.

But it's already happened.

The other brothers began to insist on trying their hands first.

Alfons and German are serious about killing Heinrich or risking their own deaths.

Before, it was a matter of if, but now it's a matter of when.

And that was the beginning of the end for the emperor.

Bastard.

This wouldn't have happened if Heinrich hadn't listened.

But is it really possible that it didn't happen? Louise had seen the open disregard and contempt for Heinrich from afar and up close.

Even if this hadn't happened, it would have happened anyway.

In places you don't see, in places you don't recognize. Without even asking his consent.

I wonder if they're really going to try to kill Heinrich on their own terms.

I don't think they'd be that stupid, I don't think they'd be that stupid.

Can humans be that stupid?

Louise von Schwarz wanted to punch the Emperor in the face for irresponsibly dropping the bomb.

But the bomb was already there.

He just didn't want to admit it was a bomb.

'It's a little unfortunate that the commander of Cernstadt has come to see you like this.

"......Now, did you say you're sorry?

Louise's brow furrowed as she heard the words.

You think the emperor's power will ever be the same.

All of humanity's powers have become smaller, and emperors no longer have the power and authority they once did.

Do they have any illusions that they stand above everyone, as they did in the days after the Demon War, when the power of the empire soared.

'To save the life of the Commander's son, the Emperor of the Empire has the audacity to poke his nose into the domestic affairs of another nation, and you don't even bother to thank him. Isn't that something to be ashamed of?'

'......!

"Did they think I wouldn't know?

Bertus de Gradias.

The Emperor's words sent chills down Louise's spine.

Something that only three people in the Schwarz family know: the king, the current queen, and Louise.

The emperor knew it.

'The Commander was an early graduate of the Royal Academy of Cernstadt at the age of eighteen.'

'.......'

Royal Academy of Cernstadt.

A prodigy, she graduated early from even the Royal Academy.

That's how it's known in the world.

'Heinrich von Schwarz was born after I had traveled abroad for about a year on a graduation trip....... I don't think that's a coincidence.'

Louise squints and meets Bertus's gaze.

"Isn't that a dropout, not an early graduate?

Under Bertus's gaze, Luiz felt the pressure on his breath.

"Raphael Muller.

'......!

"Do you need further clarification?

The Emperor already knew the name Louise had buried in her mind long ago.

The name, apparently, was the name of someone she loved.

Already, long dead.

'How the Schwarz family incorporated a supposedly illegitimate child into the royal family....... I don't understand this, King Constantine was a very flawed person in that regard, he wouldn't create an illegitimate child, Catherine the Great would have collapsed if she knew of the existence of an illegitimate child, but somehow Heinrich was accepted, not disposed of....... I don't understand. The Schwarz family I know is not like that.'

Louise looked at Bertus with a stony expression.

These are great men whose character would not allow them to have an illegitimate child, and if they did, they would deal with it, not incorporate it into the royal family.

But Heinrich was somehow incorporated into the royal family. Of course, we're starting with a result.

The much-hated youngest prince is probably a bastard, and if you're going to hate him so much, why keep him alive?

There are times when you have no choice but to keep them alive.

Louise von Schwarz never married, despite her advanced age.

He hasn't taken the throne yet, but it's very important for his heirs.

Still, I'm not married, and I don't think I ever will be.

And the Royal Academy in Cernstadt is very similar to a temple.

Training is mixed and tiered.

Bertus's comments are both politically and humanly disrespectful.

If you want to make it a problem, you can make it a problem.

But Louise couldn't say anything. That was proof in itself.

"I have a number of guesses in my head, but I'm not going to say them out loud, because any more than that would just annoy the commander.

'.......'

"That's the point.

Bertus puts down his teacup and looks at Louise von Schwarz, who is frozen in place.

"You can't keep everything.

You must select

Heinrich was made to realize that he was in danger, which led to an argument.

"You have to choose, before you lose everything by not choosing this or that.

Bertus had hastened what would one day happen.

So Louise von Schwarz has to choose something before she thinks everything is fine as it is, and then everything goes to shit.

'...... That Heinrich wanted to live. Is that really all there is to it?'

At Louise's question, Bertus smirked.

"I could have stayed put and not had to have this uncomfortable encounter, so why risk it?

I didn't want my friend to die.

Bertus didn't, even though he could have made a huge political gain at the expense of power.

At the risk of treading on Louise von Schwarz's toes, I gave Heinrich a hint.

So, what the heck was that for?

At Bertus' words, Louise could no longer believe that the Emperor had any sinister intentions.

If you want to protect your son, you must see blood.

Bertus said nothing more, as if he'd had enough of prying into the domestic affairs of another country.

'Why.......'

"Why did you kill Raphael?

'Why on earth would.......'

"Why, did you have to do that?

That was a long time ago.

"You've lost your mind.

"You can't have dirty commoners in the royal family.

'I told him to mingle with the common people, do math, and understand their physiology. I didn't tell him to give them jung.

"Do you mean to tell me that with all your talents and gifts, you couldn't even discern that much?

'I have given you the punishment you deserve for coveting what you dare not have.

"Do you really think there's room for such a thing as personal affection on the way to becoming Queen of Cernstadt and laying the foundations of an empire that will one day surpass the House of Gradias?

'You were foolish, daughter.

'Yes, humans make mistakes. No one is perfect, so you made a mistake.

"So let's move on from this mistake.

"Erase, forget everything and start fresh.

The cruel words of her father, Constantin von Schwarz, left Louise stunned.

It was early love.

I could have called it immature, but I couldn't help but call it love.

Clumsy love bore clumsy fruit, and I paid a cruel price.

It was the first real emotion I'd ever felt outside of a world where everything was forced upon me like it was suffocating.

In the real world, where you're used to elegance and hypocrisy, honor and dignity, things you don't even want. It was the first thing he had of his own volition.

It was taken away.

It was trampled on.

"No.

It was a transaction.

'Don't take anything from me, no more.'

"What?

"If you try to take it, you'll lose me.

Trading for your life.

I can't take back what's already been taken, but I didn't want to take more.

That's why he threatened his parents with his life.

Don't try to take my children.

The king and queen couldn't give up the Schwarz family's best piece of history.

The child she gave birth to was disguised as her father's illegitimate son and incorporated into the royal family.

Very few people knew the truth, and that was true of the other royals as well as his firstborn son.

The end of a tangle of lies, deceit, and half-truths.

"......."

"Nu, Nu......."

Louise von Schwarz had killed her last two brothers with her own hands, and she looked into the eyes of her son, who stared back at her in horror.

-grunt

She sheathed her sword.

"Let's go back."

"Nuh-uh. What the....... What the hell are you talking about. I... I'm trying to get my brothers to......."

"Let's go back."

The brothers ended up trying to kill Heinrich several times without consulting him.

If Louise hadn't kept an eye on the situation, she could have lost her son with both eyes open.

If the Emperor had had other ideas, he would have used this to implicate the ringleaders, the two brothers, and himself in the destruction of the House of Schwarz.

We don't know what changed his mind, but the emperor had a change of heart.

I'm not bashing the Schwarzes, but I am telling Louise to get her act together or it might be too late.

The emperor told her that to protect something, you have to see blood.

Louise saw blood.

The price of killing flesh and blood was the protection of flesh and blood.

Louise grunts and walks toward the horse.

His blood-soaked fingertips were shaking violently, as if he were suffering from hydrocephalus.

Leaving Alfons and German abandoning their horses, Louise mounted her horse, and Heinrich, without his ice, followed suit at Louise's command.

I killed my brothers.

How to make this happen.

Louise is helpless to do anything about it.

Frozen, she doesn't know what to say to her youngest, who has just discovered that her oldest sister is actually her mother.

I had to make a choice, so I made a choice.

That was it.

-Hihihihi!

Riding their horses, they leave the abandoned warehouse and disappear.

Confusion and vagueness.

As the two emotional figures disappeared from the warehouse, the two Inyoungs appeared out of thin air.

"......."

"......."

Reinhardt and Herriot were there to hear the unbelievable story.

"This is....... What....... is?"

"......I don't know."

At Reinhardt's frozen words, Harriet shook her head.
