            Episode 519.





The way is clear.

The Alliance will soon recognize the intervention of an unknown force, but not yet.

And if you clear the path too early, other monsters will take its place.

So until the Allies begin their next advance, our units will have some time to play out their primary operations in real time.

"I need to see the status of the Allied garrison.

Heinrich von Schwarz is assassinated.

However, the exact timing is unknown.

So we decided to look at the trends in the Allied garrisons.

I can get the information from Sarkhegar, who should already be infiltrating, but I need to see it with my own eyes.

It wasn't just Heinrich's problem, there were a lot of things I wanted to see with my own eyes.

How the Temple guys are doing, how they've changed.

And I wanted to see how things were going for Ellen.

The other four said it was too risky, but what Sarkegar can do, I can do to some extent.

You can't turn into a beast, but you can turn into a person.

The Allies are outnumbered.

Even one is too many.

As such, it shouldn't be difficult to get around the garrison disguised as a member of the Allied forces.

And this war basically doesn't do much about security and spying issues.

Your opponents are unspeakable monsters.

There is no spying and no surprise because the enemy is always coming for you. There is no such thing as information warfare. Bertus knows I'm not dangerous, so he's not going to be on the lookout for my forces.

Since they know I'm watching, it's possible that they've designed the situation to make it easier for me to see what's going on. Of course, that's a bit of a stretch.

I arrived near the Allied garrison dressed as an Imperial officer.

Herriot teleported me away.

"......that's a lot."

I'd heard about it, but I'd never seen it in person, and the sheer scale of the Allied forces left me speechless.

If there's a crisis, I'll flee to Scroll, and if there's no such crisis, Herriot will be waiting to take me to Edina at a designated time at a designated location.

Due tomorrow.

"Your Highness, do you recall your rank and affiliation?"

Beside me was Sarkegar, disguised as my attendant.

"Lieutenant Lindell, Disciplinarian, 4th Training Command, 1st Imperial Legion."

Of course it's bullshit. Buddha exists, but there is no such thing as Lt. Lindell.

Why officers, so that the common soldier doesn't question who's where.

The reason for this is because there are very few of them in this Allied garrison.

Their job is to train recruits from the ecliptic and then deploy them into the field with supplies via mass teleportation, but they don't need to be there.

But it's not the only one.

They're actually officers in the garrison, but they're very few in number. So it's very unlikely that you're going to hear, "I'm a disciplinarian and I don't know anybody like you.

Other officers would say "disciplinarian" and move on.

So I've created a false identity that allows me to move around this garrison without anyone bothering me.

It was a cover story recommended by Sarkegar, who had gotten to know the garrison pretty well in two days.

This isn't even necessary in the first place.

There are so many soldiers and officers in a garrison that they don't all recognize each other, even if they're from the same army.

It's Sarkhegar's job to provide a bird's eye view of the entire Alliance.

There's only one thing I want to see.

To determine the status of the Temple Royal Class garrison.



* * *



Sarkegar is a man of his word.

I thought I was doing a good job, but I had given Sarkegar a pretty big task.

He can transform without any base, so we just sent him into enemy territory. You said to gather information.

Within two days, I had not only mapped out the distribution of allied forces across the vast garrison, but I had also come up with a plausible cover story for my inability to transform into a beast or bug.

No, but if you're good at your job, that's a problem in itself.

When you throw something at them and they do well, there's this expectation that they're going to do well.

What makes a great subordinate.......

Isn't that what happens when you're good at something, you end up taking on more and more difficult tasks?

If being great makes you dangerous, shouldn't you be better off not being great?

The garrison was so noisy that even if Sarkegar and I spoke normally, it would be impossible for anyone to overhear.

-Move! Move it!

-Emergency muster! Four platoons assemble!

Not to mention the shouting all around the garrison.

-Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

-PushBenefit!

A sound like the pounding of an army drum echoed in the air.

"You must be busy."

"Yes, the top combatants are, but the logistical costs of arming the lower ranks are enormous."

"Of course......."

Master classes can use Auror blades, and higher level combatants are given higher quality weapons. For example, enchanted.

The self-repairing longsword that Ellen and I used when we went to the Darklands is also considered a luxury item. Such luxury items can be damaged in battle, but they are durable because of their inherent quality.

A lowly soldier doesn't even get a chance to hold such a thing.

Relatively low-quality arsenals are their lot.

So once you're in combat, even if you survive, your gear is bound to be damaged.

This is why garrisons can only churn out so much armor until the blacksmiths are too scared to set up a garrison.

Spear and sword, bow and arrow.

-Bang!

I could hear the smelting of armor and the sound of grass, and I could see Union blacksmiths with reddened faces.

I realized how much manpower it takes to fight a war, and how many non-combatants, but somehow more important than combatants, are involved.

I know in my head that war isn't just about swords and spears, but seeing the bustling Allied garrison made it seem like it was right up close and personal.

I am a part of this war, but we can always return to Edina, our headquarters, at any time in the prime numbers.

This army is so large that the number of people who can travel very long distances via mass teleportation is extremely limited.

Many will not be able to return to their homes until this war is over, and many more have technically lost those homes.

I could also hear people's conversations to some extent if I concentrated.

-Well, at least I'm not starving. That's better.

-What does it matter if I die tomorrow?

-Have you ever starved to the point of wanting to die? I'd rather be dead than alive.

The safest thing in the barrel of a gun is a soldier.

Some say it's better to die than to starve, while others fear the shadow of death.

The war was tangible, the hatred, fear, and hope of the people was palpable.

There were conversations cursing me, and there were conversations praising Ellen.

Some wondered if it would be possible to feed this army until the war was over.

There were conversations between officers who worried about the fate of humanity if this army was wiped out.

-What happens if a demon attacks us now?

-No matter how powerful a demon is, how can he raid this place when there's Lord Tana and the warriors here? Without going insane.......

-Didn't the Demon slaughter dozens of Swordmasters on the Ecliptic the other day?

-But then he lost to you. You stabbed him through the heart. In truth, the demon may already be dead.

I walk through the Allied garrison with a bitter smile.

"That's quite....... That's a lot of space."

The Union garrison was large and populated.

So there was a lot of back and forth, and a lot of variety.

It wasn't just Saddam who was clamoring for a successor, but the usual suspects in an army like this.

And then there were the weird ones.

-Woooooooo!

From somewhere, I could hear the sounds of soldiers crowding and admiring, and there was a scene unfolding there that I never thought I would see in a war zone, especially under these circumstances.

-Kung!

-I told you, I'm a dog person.

There was a soldier who made a sneaky little brown dog sit, stand, and do other petty tricks, and there were soldiers who watched.

"What....... do you have a dog, a military dog?"

Even the squeaky-clean Chuck and Chuck were mongrels, so they weren't military dogs. This wasn't a war for military dogs.

"Surviving wild beasts seem to be trickling into Allied garrisons. Or perhaps the humans are finding them and bringing them in on purpose."

Just as humans survive this mess, so do the beasts.

"As you can see, the commanders didn't seem to mind if they thought it was good for the morale of the troops. It's not a lot, but there are quite a few units like that."

They may have been rescued, or they may have come to you because they think you will protect them.

-Ohhhh!

The soldiers are in awe of the dog's silly antics.

The survivors protect the surviving beasts.

It's just a dog. It's probably fed, and I don't know if it's a platoon or a company, but the soldiers in that garrison are going to keep that dog around.

They will cherish that dog, even though it has no role in this war.

It doesn't mean anything, but it's important because it doesn't mean anything.

Sarkegar stared at the spectacle.

"Your Highness."

"Uh."

"I, for one, wished for the destruction of all men."

Sarkegar stares at the soldiers, who laugh at the dog.

"But I don't think this is what you were hoping for....... I guess."

They have broken us, so be ye broken.

Sarkegaard wanted that.

That's why I'm watching a broken humanity.

Sneaky dog.

What makes us different from those dogs.

Sarkozy's thoughts seemed to have gotten complicated. It wasn't about forgiving humanity or anything.

But you'll feel a certain inevitability when you look at the broken things and can't help but hate them.

It's hard to put into words what we feel.

I can only describe the view in a few words.

A broken humanity laughs at a dog.

You look at what's still there and try to forget what you've lost.

We drove through the landscape.



* * *



"That's a long way."

"I guess that's to be expected with such a large force."

The Union garrison was so large that it would take three months just to get to where Temple's troops were stationed.

They didn't have officers on horseback in the garrison for nothing.

Of course, we don't need horses now that we can run faster than a horse at a sprint.

But when someone who is nothing more than an Allied drill sergeant is sprinting through the garrison at superhuman speeds, things can get very awkward.

The Temple Garrison is also considered quite important to the Alliance, so it's almost in the center of the garrison, so it's the same distance from all sides.

Eventually, we made it to where the Temple troops were stationed, even within the Allied garrison.

Many of Temple's students were drafted into the military. And Temple had a student population of over 100,000 to begin with.

As such, even an army of students is a massive force, and even without the use of magical enhancements, the level of combat power of Temple students is far beyond that of ordinary soldiers.

They are either professionally trained in no-tech or have studied magic.

Temple's forces are no match for the Allied mainstays.

There, a huge number of weapons from the temple were placed in the hands of the students.

You and Sarkegar have entered the Temple garrison.

Unsurprisingly, the average age of those coming and going was very low compared to other garrisons, both male and female.

Students are educated in the same environment regardless of their status.

But many have lost their homes and many have lost their countries.

Your identity has become a mystery.

Even among the nobility of the Empire, there are many who have lost their estates.

So it's safe to say that now that status has truly become irrelevant, they are all equal under the umbrella of student-turned-soldier.

"They teach in this environment, too."

"I suppose."

I nodded at Sarkegar's words.

It's not just the students, it's also the teachers.

In addition to combat-specific classes, we also conduct general training from time to time. There are no exams, of course, but it's not like the human race is extinct yet.

You may not be able to train for the future often, but you still have a class.

That's probably true for the Royal Class side as well.

Of course, Temple powers, and more importantly Royal Class powers, have little time for such general training.

Temples aren't completely dead.

When there are students and teachers, something called education can occur.

As if to shout out that you can't just train in a temple.

Sarkozy and I walked on, feeling pretty hopeless at the sights I had described.

The centerpiece of the Temple Garrison.

Royal Class Garrison.

I had no choice but to face the challenges I knew were coming.

"It's a defense......."

The Royal Class garrison area had a circle of barriers around it.

This had already been reported before Sarkegar started gathering information.

"As I said, the Royal Class garrison has strict access control."

"...... Looks like it."

"Apparently there were too many people trying to get a glimpse of Ellen Artorius, even from a distance, and some even broke into the barracks."

This is also something that didn't happen in the original.

Ludwig is the master of Alsbringer, and Ellen is the warrior's sister.

As it turns out, their fame has skyrocketed, but they weren't gated like this.

I wonder if this is me after all.

My presence has squared away the fame of my arch-enemy, Ellen, and made her more prominent in the Alliance than she was before. Your work on the Gate so far will be important.

It even gets to the point of stalking.

So we ended up building this fence around the Royal Class garrison, with soldiers standing at the entrance with lights in their eyes to keep an eye out for unwanted visitors.

Herriot had entered Ellen's barracks by spatial travel.

I wouldn't have gone through that entrance in the first place.

No fake identities, no nothing.

There's a sign on the fence that says, "No unauthorized persons," so no one is going to get in there without a reason.

"I'll take it from here."

"......."

Sarkhegar can shapeshift into something other than human in the first place, so he could have gotten into that Royal Class garrison.

I can't.

But Sarkegaard does.

I even knew that in the first place.

Of course, I only saw the Royal Class garrison, not the Allied return, so I can't say it's obviously meaningless.

But it would be even more ridiculous to bring him in now and have them both move in there with a spatial shift.

As long as it looks like this, even if I could get in there, I'd be an uninvolved party entering a Royal Class garrison.

You can't just go in as someone on the inside. The Royal Class garrison is not very large. It would be crazy to have two people in the same place.

Sarkhegar would be able to sneak in and check out the people without being seen.

But you've come this far.

We've come this far.

Among the tents and huts of the garrison, Sarkhegar prepares for his transformation.

It will turn into a bird and fly away.

But.

I want to see.

What happened to everyone.

How everyone is doing.

I know it's just a pain in the ass to check.

Still.

There are some things you want to see.

"Sarkegar."

"Yes."

"I'll do it."

"......Yes?"

The image of the soldiers laughing at the dog came to mind.

"You're controlling the people, not the beasts."

You're in control, not the beast.

And it's an environment that doesn't need a lot of beasts.

The existence of the beast itself is not suspicious.

"Can we do this?"

"I, Your Highness......."

"No, but we can try."

If it's a beast, you should be able to get in there.

I've never done this before.

However, it hasn't been done, not impossible.



* * *



Sarkegar's shapeshifting abilities allow him to turn into a bug or a dragon.

But I haven't tried it.

I didn't even dare to try because I was told that if I did it wrong, I might not come back.

So I wanted to be able to change into either human or demon form, but at least maintain a "humanoid" appearance.

But right now, it's impossible to get in as someone else.

I could have taken Sarkozy's word for it, but I wanted to see it with my own eyes.

I didn't need to come here if I was going to listen to it instead of seeing it with my own eyes.

Sarkeghar's face fell when I told him that I would suddenly turn into a beast.

But you should be able to get back on track.

If it doesn't, it's going to be self-implied, unspoken, or whatever.

We're not going to have this ridiculous situation where you're transformed into a beast and you can't get back, and you're screwed. At least there's a way to get achievement points or something in case you don't make it back.

Do.

Blind spots in the Temple garrison where people can't see you.

-Angel

I became a cat.

Why cats.

First of all, cats are small, and if they're spotted lurking around and eavesdropping, they'll probably let it slide.

No matter how weird it is, if it's cute, they'll understand.

Because that's what people do.

It's dangerous to turn into a dog, because you might suddenly be put on a leash. It's bad for hiding.

My supplies and clothes didn't fall to the floor.

I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that Sarkhegar's ring has some sort of function, like when Sarkhegar turns from animal to human, he doesn't appear naked.

But the ring was hanging from my ear, invisible. Like a piercing.

And the problem.

It's not easy to move your limbs.

What to say.

It's hard to put into words, but it's not like you're moving a limb, it's like you're operating a machine for the first time in your life.

You know, the kind where you have to fly a fighter jet you've never flown before.......

More like a mobile suit than a fighter jet?

No, I've never ridden either, so it doesn't really matter what I say, but.......

-Burr

I feel like a bum.

My limbs don't move the way I want them to!

No, it's not a limb.

All four of my legs won't work! I can't even walk!

Is the cat's limbs out of sync?

How do you extend your claws?

Am I supposed to know how a cat's limbs work or something?

I was frozen in place, wobbling on my right front paw, hopping on my hind legs.

-Hair!

Eventually, I couldn't even stand up straight, so I just rolled over onto my side.

Literally, helplessly.

-Burrrr

You're lying on your side, shivering, but your body isn't moving.

Was this really that hard?

What has Sarkozy done so far?

First of all, the four-legged cat is like this, but how did you do the bug thing, how did you do the winged beast?

-Cat!

Sarkegar can even talk, but he doesn't make any sounds other than meows.

"......."

Sarkegar stares down at me as I flop onto my side, my limbs flailing.

Why buy and suffer.

And then.

-Snarl!

Eventually, Sarkegaard changed his look, too.

A cat like me, but a little bigger.

-Angel

-Pulp! Flick!

Sarkegar tumbles out of place.

As if to say, follow along.

-pot!

Why is the tail going up?

-.......

Sarkegar the Holy Grave stares at me.

He shakes his head in silence.

You can't.

Stop.

Back to normal.

It was a nod of determination.

No, it's not changing, it's just that whatever it is, I don't know how to operate it yet!

You can do it if you know how!

No documentation?

-Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!

I blurted out, and Sarkegar stared at me for a long moment.

He stomped on my foot and started doing things as if he was trying to teach me something, one step at a time.

The.

Honestly.

I had no idea what it was trying to teach me.
