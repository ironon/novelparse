            Episode 527.





When Charlotte hears that Heinrich von Schwarz is about to be assassinated, she looks incredulous.

No, I know that doesn't make sense.

Well, it does happen, right?

I know it's all my fault!

"Just pretend it's happening and tell me."

"Yes."

Issue.

Heinrich is killed in the line of duty one day when he goes on a mission as usual.

It's not an assassination, it's disguised as a death by monsters.

In the original, as now, Heinrich is still an asshole by that point, but his position has become very important, so it's a very big shock to the Allies as a whole, as well as to the Royal Class.

Ludwig watches Heinrich's funeral, which is carried out with alarming speed at the hands of Cernstadt royalty, and realizes that something is amiss.

Ludwig, who reports to Bertus on the point, is authorized by Bertus to investigate the matter in secret.

While the Allies mourn, Ludwig follows up on his own suspicions and, with the help of several people, realizes that the Cernstadt royal family is responsible.

In the aftermath of this event, Bertus, enraged that such petty politics had caused such a disaster at such a time, executed all of Cernstadt's royalty and forcibly unified the chain of command under the Empire.

At the time of the original story, Bertus was acting Emperor and serving as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces. Of course, the previous Emperor, Neliod de Gradias, is now dead, and Bertus is the current Emperor, so he's traveling back and forth between the Imperial and Allied camps.

Anyway, after that, of course, there is a huge backlash within the Cernstadt army, and there are even some desertions.

In this situation, Ludwig makes a strong appeal to the Cernstadt army. Let us not give up this war on which the fate of mankind depends.

In the original, Ludwig has the Alsbringer, which is very symbolic in that context.

So, the story is that Cernstadt's troops will stay with the Allies at Ludwig's urging.

If left alone, Heinrich will die.

Heinrich is a classmate, but before that he is a very big force for the Allies.

Power bleeds, the coalition splits, and then it's sewn back together again.

Ludwig's persuasions and the cause win him over, but the alliance continues to falter in the days that follow as the Imperials and Cernstadt's allies work together.

It's a bad thing to wake up to.

So I hope this doesn't happen.

I've warned Heinrich in a letter, but I don't know if that will really work or not.

"Anyway, let's say Heinrich is assassinated, and I want to resolve this case in a way that doesn't kill Heinrich and doesn't hurt the Allies, is that possible?"

Direct contact with Heinrich would likely be futile. He wouldn't trust me.

But what if I killed all of Heinrich's brothers-in-law?

That alone creates a huge chain of command.



And if I don't do something about it, a demon appears in the Allied garrison and kills the Cernstadt royals.

Your allies' hatred of you will be through the roof, and there will be a lot of unrest within your alliance. You never know when a demon might attack your allies.

And if I do that in the first place, Heinrich will never forgive me for killing his family. He'll never know that he'd be dead if he hadn't killed them.

If all else fails, I may take this route, killing all of Heinrich's brothers myself. But I realize that it's not the best option, it's not the only option, it's the worst option.

No matter what I do, the hatred against me is so great that even Heinrich from here on out considers me an enemy of the family, and I don't see why I should have to carry that extra weight on my shoulders.



It's possible to disguise the fact that it's not you, but someone else.

Whether through Sarkeghar or myself, by assassination.

After all, there was an assassination within the Alliance, so there will be a disturbance and the Alliance's progress will be slowed.

There will be a reorganization of the chain of command, and if the Allies start commanding Cernstadt as in the original, there will be a problem.

The chaos doesn't stop when subordinate commanders pass the baton.



Even if Heinrich, the sole heir to Cernstadt, were to take over the baton, he'd have a problem: He's only strong because he's strong, but he's never led or commanded before, and he doesn't have the talent.

After all, the three men who want to kill Heinrich are clearly men of some use.

Three royals who, if left alone, will cause an accident, but who are doing just fine with what they have to do right now.



They're villains because they have irreplaceable needs, and removing them causes problems.

It's easy to clean up.

However, post-cleanup issues pose a different set of problems.

So as noiselessly as possible.

To pass the case off entirely in a way that doesn't kill Heinrich and doesn't cause too much trouble within the Allies.

Is that possible?

I can't think of anything else here, so I turn to Charlotte.

"Hmmm....... I'm not exactly up to speed on the Allied situation, but....... Reinhardt, I think I have a pretty good idea of what you're thinking......."

Charlotte begins to seriously consider my question.

"Heinrich's sudden rise to prominence is bound to make his brothers nervous....... So we want to keep him alive and get rid of him before he becomes a bigger problem....... Hmm....... I don't think that's entirely out of the question."

Charlotte shakes her head.

"But it's a matter of possibility, not necessarily certainty that it will happen?"

It's possible, but there's no guarantee it will happen.

"If it was an assassination, they'd probably try to cover it up, like he was killed in the line of duty, something like that....... That's what the Schwarzes did....... I wonder if they're dumb enough to do that......."

Dumb things.

I have to agree with Charlotte.

The gate situation isn't even finished, and the brothers kill Heinrich for being too powerful.

So in the original, when Bertus realizes what's going on, he's not only angry, he's incredulous.

In this situation.

In moments like this.

One of the Alliance's most important forces, even its own brothers, is killed over a mere royal dispute.

Bertus loses his temper and, with the authority of the commander-in-chief, executes all the Cernstadt royalty.

Rather than go to war with these crazy things, we might as well kill them and make a little noise.

In fact, the Allies were on the verge of splitting, but Ludwig saved them from disaster.



In the end, it was clear that Charlotte had decided that the incident was too stupid to happen.

"Yeah, it's a possibility, but it can't hurt to be prepared, right? The Allies' bleeding is our bleeding."

"Okay, so let's assume that's how things are anyway. What....... If there really is an assassination, Heinrich will probably be untouchable by the time this war is properly concluded, even by the House of Cernstadt....... It doesn't seem so improbable."

"Hmm, I guess so. She'll get almost as much hero treatment as Ellen."

Ellen's overstated status is not lost on Heinrich, the beggar.

Finally, Ludwig, the original protagonist, is nowhere near the fame of Heinrich.

So by the time the Gate crisis is over and the rebuilding of humanity begins in earnest, Heinrich will already be an unsung hero, not just in Cernstadt, but everywhere humanity is alive.

"If that happens, Heinrich may have to be king, even if he doesn't want to be."

"Well....... for sure. That could be a possibility."

The darker the times, the more powerful the symbol.

As the youngest member of the Cernstadt royal family, Heinrich may be forced to take the throne almost unwillingly.

The youngest, who, if alive, will have such influence that he will have to be king, whether he likes it or not.

Brothers who are resentful of being usurped as successors by such a youngster and want to kill him before he becomes untouchably famous.

Charlotte seemed to be convinced that it was a real possibility.

"In the end, the question is not whether Heinrich will be assassinated or not, but if he is, how will you stop it......."

Charlotte's brow furrows as she considers.

"I suppose it would be easiest to work things out through Bertus, but that would mean Heinrich would be completely on the Empire's side....... So we'd have to cut him off from Cernstadt altogether, which would only require convincing Heinrich....... and the status quo would be maintained, but that's a risk."

"I realize that contact with Bertus is dangerous....... but if that's the only way to do it, I suppose we have no choice."

"There's more to it than that."

Charlotte shook her head.

"The Schwarzes are likely to take this as interference in their internal affairs."

"I'm offering to take care of ......'s pain, and you're going to throw a fit about internal affairs interference?"

"Of course."

Charlotte sighs.

"Cernstadt is the First Reich."

"......, right?"

"Not now, but don't you remember the Orbis class?"

"Ah."

The Orbis class would also be at the end of the gate, and while the class is gone, the students remain. Therefore, students from the Orbis class will also remain in the Temple garrison.

One of the many things that happened because of what I was doing was the collapse of the Orbis class.

The relationship between the Orbis class and the Royal class can be described in a single word.

Inferiority complex.

Eternal first and second place.

The Empire and Cernstadt are like that.

"Cernstadt is the closest country to the Empire, so there is a tremendous sense of inferiority in Cernstadt, not only to the Empire but also to its people. How much more so to the Schwarz family?"

"Oh....... I see."

The nations closest to empire are, after all, the ones with the strongest aspirations for empire.

To be precise, it is the Schwarz family of Cernstadt that envies the Imperial House of Gradias the most in the world and feels inferior to it.

"The Empire hasn't stayed that way because history hasn't recorded it. How many times has the Schwarz family tried to overthrow the Empire?"

There is an enemy of humanity.

Empires were built under its banner.

But that's not to say there hasn't been some confusion.

Charlotte was an empress, so she would have known a lot of the backstabbing and maneuvering that went unrecorded.

"So the most important thing for the Imperial Emperor is to maintain a relationship with Cernstadt that is neither too distant nor too close: it is his most important diplomatic contact, a potential enemy, and nevertheless his most important ally."

Cernstadt is important to the Empire. For better or worse.

"Aside from the fact that our approach to Bertus is dangerous for him. If Bertus were to remove Heinrich from the House of Cernstadt altogether and make him a member of the Imperial staff, it could be read as a gesture of the Empire's intent to swallow up the House of Schwarz, which would of course be viewed as interference in internal affairs."

"No, shouldn't you be happy when a powerful rising contender to the throne decides to abdicate on his own accord, even if you hate the empire?"

At my words, Charlotte shook her head.

"Reinhard, this way it's not just a gesture and a possibility, it's actually possible for Bertus to devour the Schwarz family through Heinrich."

"......what?"

"The right of succession is a sham, and even if Heinrich has renounced it, given the position he'll have once this war is over, he can still influence the royal succession. And Bertus could make Heinrich king of Cernstadt if he really wanted to. It's a chance for him to change the whole Schwarz family, which has been such a problem for him, by making Heinrich his own king. It's rather strange that he doesn't do that. Why wouldn't he do that if he could?"

"......Huh."

I'm not mistaking Cernstadt for interference in internal affairs.

It's actually interference.

If you can get Heinrich to disassociate himself from the Cernstadt family to eliminate the possibility of assassination, you can use him to get the Cernstadt family eaten by the Empire.

Charlotte thought about it and shook her head.

"Now that I think about it, this won't work, Heinrich will die because he's in that state."

"......You mean to tell me this is going to irritate the House of Cernstadt?"

"Yes, Louise von Schwarz, the current heir apparent, is no fool, quite the contrary, and if the Empire makes a decision like this, she'll quickly see what's about to happen, and it will only serve to further alienate Heinrich, not to mention put her hands on him."

What we do to deal with assassinations actually makes them more likely.

It would be even more dangerous to sever the ties between Heinrich and Cernstadt.

If Heinrich stays within Cernstadt's sphere of influence, the royal family feels threatened and murders him.

The Schwarzes murder Heinrich because they fear that if Heinrich is allowed to remain within the Empire's sphere of influence, the Empire will use Heinrich to swallow up the Schwarzes.

"Doomed to die....... Authorized."

No matter what you do, Heinrich will be killed.

The moderates can't avoid a future where Heinrich is killed.

"Do we have to kill the Schwarzes in the garrison in some way?"

"......I don't know about anyone else, but not Louise von Schwarz."

"Why......?"

"There will be more chaos, surely. He's the commander-in-chief, and he's got a very strong position in Cernstadt. What would an army do without its commander-in-chief? There's no one in Cernstadt who's a better commander than he is, and if you kill them, except Louise von Schwarz and Heinrich, there's no point, because Louise von Schwarz is going to kill Heinrich one day anyway."

It turns out that Charlotte was worried about the same things I was worried about.

It hurts too much to be a headache.

They're too important.

Heinrich and Louise von Schwarz are also important.



If it matters if one of them dies, and there's no way to solve the problem other than death, what the heck do you do?

"Let's get him."

"......?"

For a moment, I didn't understand what Charlotte was talking about.

"In the Allies, Heinrich is tied to too many political machinations. If an assassination were to occur, I believe it would be after the war, but....... If Heinrich is assassinated on the march, then every moment is dangerous, and I think the only way to preserve his life is to stay with us."

"...... also does."

It's not that we haven't thought about it.

"But there's no guarantee that Heinrich will join us."

"Sure. It's going to be hard for me to accept what's happened, for us, and for you."

It seems highly unlikely that Heinrich will come over to my side.

It's also clear that coercive or violent methods must be used.

"But off the top of my head, I can only think of....... I guess this is the only way to go."

With that, Charlotte metallurgized the rest of her sandwich.

Heinrich Possop.

I can try, but will Heinrich be convinced?

It's not about our power, it's about your safety.

There's no way Heinrich is going to buy that when the assassination attempt hasn't even happened.

Consider my case.

Bertus sneaks up on you and tells you that Charlotte and the rest of Edina's core faction are trying to get rid of you, and that you should join the Empire.

Do I believe it?

I don't think I'll ever believe it.



* * *



Recruit Heinrich.

There doesn't seem to be any other way to do it at the moment.

After the meal, even though it was late, Charlotte and I had a cup of tea on the terrace of the royal castle.

I love climbing the minarets and looking down on Rajaq, but this terrace has the same panoramic view of Rajaq.

I don't know about you, but I think the view from a royal castle is better than a temple.

We need to think a bit more about how we want to include Heinrich.

"Cernstadt Wangara....... Nothing to do with me now, but they were a lot of talking and a lot of riding."

"From the sounds of it, that would have been especially true for the Empire......."

The position of First Empire and the Imperial Family, the rulers of all the empires.

The story of the Schwarz family's envy and jealousy of the empire seemed like a no-brainer to me.

It had the potential to become an empire, but the Gradias imperial family was too strong.

"I'm telling you this because....... Pardon me, but the fact that the House of Gradias has remained intact, and the Schwarzes have been unable to do more than mildly attempt to bring down the Empire, is largely due to the influence of the Darklands."

"I'm sure you did."

It's not exactly the same thing, but Bertus has said something similar in the past.

So when I unleashed terror on the ecliptic to rescue the demonic prisoners, Bertus was actually pleased, even though it cost him dearly.

He believes that this event will allow the empire to survive a little longer.

If I hadn't existed, if the gate hadn't happened.

At some point, there may have been a quasi-movement of revolutionary forces, or the empire may have split under Cernstadt's leadership.

One event so big that it consumed everything else in the world and reduced it to nothing.

"Do you know that there is an academy in Cernstadt similar to the Temple?"

"...... is it?"

That was another story I had never heard before. Cernstadt can't help but feel inferior to the Empire. It must also be envious of the Temple, a vital part of the Empire's business and the cradle of talent development and acquisition.

So instead of sending royalty to the temple, Cernstadt created a system benchmarked after the temple.

"I hear the education there is pretty good, but....... I don't know much about it, but they're trying to keep up with Temple."

Just as the Royal Class had no interest in the Orbis Class, they had no interest in the Cernstadt Academy trying to catch up to the Temple somehow.

It doesn't compare anyway, so why bother.

It must have felt like this.

"So Heinrich's admission to the Temple was quite a surprise for the Empire and for the Temple, because the Schwarzes of Cernstadt were sending royalty to the Temple, and it was like, 'Oh, my God.'"

"That's right."

There was an accident.

Therefore, it was sent to the temple like an outcast.

It was the first time I'd heard that he hadn't even gotten into the academy inside Cernstadt.

I'm aware of the situation.

But does Charlotte know?

"Hmm....... Reinhardt, you may not know this, and it may be rude of me to tell you this behind your back....... but there's an incident that seems to have forced Heinrich to come to the Temple."

"......You get the idea."

"...... is it?"

I didn't want to play dumb and then be surprised to hear it, so I gestured that I had a general idea of what Charlotte was trying to say.

Charlotte didn't specify the source of the information.

"I had a power awakening when I was very young, and that's when two of my Sun Yat-sen brothers died....... That's what I heard."

"Uh, that's probably what it was."

"Hmmm......."

Charlotte takes a sip of her tea.

"Anyway, an accident is an accident, and it was unavoidable....... I mean, Heinrich came to Temple in elementary school, so it was a long time ago......."

What is Charlotte trying to say?

"It was a very dangerous and big event, with the deaths of immediate royalty, but Heinrich should have been sent to the Temple. Was it really necessary for Heinrich to be sent away, almost like he was kicked out....... Now that I think about it."

"...... is it?"

"Yeah. Still, it was an accident. I mean, it was unintentional, but....... the Empire that hates you so much. They even sent him to the Temple, but he's royalty, so they can't execute him for an accident like that. They sent him to a faraway country, like they didn't even want to look at him. After that, they stopped caring. Well, they still don't, but even back then there was a perception that psychic powers were a sinister force......."

"Right."

Ominous power.

As a power of unknown origin and source, psychic powers are sometimes viewed as ominous, and perhaps even more so in the past.

"Don't you think that's a little bit more than a little bit of punishment?"

People died, even brothers. But at the end of the day, it's still an accident.

I wonder if Heinrich's punishment was a bit excessive.

He's still royalty.

"The thought of being overly hated....... I couldn't help but think."

Temples are schools attended by the children of powerful people, royalty, and nobility.

They come together, they are equalized, they are educated together.

But it is, after all, a school for the children of the powerful.

"You can get a sense of the political situation in different parts of the world by looking at the history of the students who come to Temple. Temple was sort of a clearinghouse for that information, to get a sense of what was going on in the continent."

"......No, really?"

"Is there any reason not to?"

Eventually, the Temple collects information on its students. Of course, it's limited to students from prestigious families, including powerful people and royalty.

"Well, it's not like we're following students around, but we're making inferences from the information that's on file. Temple has a whole department dedicated to that."

You've just learned one of the secrets of the temple that I didn't know.

It's not a specialized intelligence unit, but it's a lot of information, and Temple had no reason not to use it.

"That's how....... about Heinrich von Schwarz that I had been briefed on....... Well, it's speculative. There's something important."

"What is that?"

"Heinrich is hated by the royal family. A little too much."

"I did."

"Superpowers, aren't they usually awakened in a state of extreme distraction?"

"That's right......."

"I wonder what happened to Heinrich to awaken his powers. But even he can't remember what it was, he was too young."

Psychic powers are awakened by mental extremes.

Heinrich killed his brother.

The narrative states that he was hated by the Cernstadt royalty for the accident and banished to the temple.

What's behind it.

"I feel like I've been abused."

"......."

"The royals weren't hated because they were killed by the youngest, it's different."

Charlotte says calmly.

"I've always hated them."

Abused by his brothers, Heinrich von Schwarz suffered too much at a young age.

In it, he awakened Pyrokinesis and murdered his brothers.

A murder, but an accident nonetheless.

Psychic powers awakened after abuse.

And the reason for that abuse.

I wouldn't have taken the abuse for nothing.

"Heinrich von Schwarz may have been illegitimate."

Charlotte makes a terrifying inference.

"That explains why Heinrich is so hated by his brothers. It explains why, as you say, the Schwarzes in the garrison would want to kill Heinrich in this situation."

With all due respect to Heinrich.

Charlotte's cruel reasoning is another truth I don't know about this situation.

The margins of a filled-in story.

Soon, I couldn't help but think I was close to the right answer.

If so, Heinrich is unaware that he is illegitimate.
