            Episode 688.





There were a lot of people in the ballroom, most of them from Temple.

Most notably, all of them were sophomores when Gate broke.

Not only are there two demons, an emperor, and an empress, but everyone else's majors are revolutionary, and they all have one big job right now.

"Ivia, how are your studies going?"

Scarlett asked as she approached, and Ivia nodded.

"Yeah, I'm getting some hands-on experience these days, so it's not like I don't know anything about it."

Unsure of what to do after the war, Ivia eventually found her way to where her skills were most needed.

At the reopened Temple, he is now majoring in military studies.

Although he is not yet in active duty, he is expected to join the Imperial Army after graduating from the military academy.

And, although it was still a long way off, the Emperor intended to make Ivia commander-in-chief of the Imperial Army.

The ability to talk to everyone within range of her ability from where she sits will be more effective when she's in command.

Naturally, with the full support of the imperial family, Ivia was granted an environment where she could only study.

Scarlett looks around the ballroom with Ivia.

Students from the sophomore class at the time of Gate.

These are important people, but of course, not everyone is there, and not everyone is okay.

In particular, most of the Class B positions were vacant.

"People in my class rarely....... in my class."

"......Yes. Right."

There are only three people from Class B in this position.

Charlotte, Scarlett, and now Ivia.

No. 4 Ashur killed.

No. 9 Delphine Izadra dies.

All but number 10 Lannion Sesor, who had become a bard, were missing.

The 8th Detomorian, who remained in the Temple, had been carrying out the Emperor's secret identity since the war ended.

With the exception of Lannion Sesor, who has been heard from time to time, and five others, including Detomorians, who are certain to be alive, everyone else is unaccounted for.

Ludwig.

Christina.

Louis Ankton.

Anna De Guerna.

Their deaths were almost a foregone conclusion.

Missing on the battlefield meant death, as there were many men whose deaths could not be physically confirmed. Since Ludwig was missing from the battlefield, he must have died at the end of the last fight.

It's ridiculous to even try to find it.

There are two vacancies in Class A.

Lunges Bertus.

And Ellen Artorius.

They are both missing and wanted.

"Everybody....... Where did they go?"

In the lively atmosphere of the banquet, Scarlett imagines the faces of those she can no longer find.

Is it too much to hope that they're all still alive somewhere?

I wonder if it's a luxury.

Ivia, Scarlett, and Charlotte, who watches from afar.

I was thinking about the people I can't find anymore.



* * *



Since the banquet was being held in an entire palace, the group was divided into several groups.

There were three or four of them, all from the Temple, of course.

Even though we're all a little bit distant from each other, we have a bond that we've been through a war together.

Even those involved in politics, who were in places unrelated to the war, were not readily accepted into the mixed group of Temple members, even though they were not outright excluded.

Of course, they were also relatively young, so they weren't able to intervene, and the Temple attendees weren't interested in political gain in the first place.

That's not to say that there aren't people who are completely apolitical.

Aside from the emperors and empresses, the most powerful person in the world is probably the current King of Cernstadt, Heinrich von Schwarz, both in terms of actual and perceived political power.

"......."

"You're going to lose your shit, asshole."

"What difference does it make if you see it?"

Of course, at this point, the great King of Cernstadt was not paying attention to the banquet, but rather staring off into the distance, listening to his friends' rebukes.

It's been a long time since we've been together, and we're not eating or drinking, just staring at each other with our mouths shut, not talking, so I can't help but hear Kono Lint and Erich say things like that.

But Heinrich's mouth twists into a grimace and he glares at his friends.

Heinrich's eyes were on the Emperor.

The Emperor was talking to Empress Louise, who was now at his side.

The contrast between his helplessness and the empress's pathetic look was striking.

"Don't you see?"

"I can't help it, but......."

"I've never been in that situation, so I don't know."

Heinrich's brow narrowed at Lint and Erich's irresponsible response.

Kaier chuckles at the sight.

"I know it's not what you want to be, but sometimes I'm glad I wasn't born into royalty, thanks to you."

Heinrich's story reminded us all that power sometimes leads to things that are beyond the reach of the normal mind.

It's something we have to do, and it's something we need to do.

But everyone gets dizzy.

Kono Lindt shakes his head.

"But what are you so worried about, you've never held hands with me before anyway?"

Actually, yes.

The relationship between Empress Louise and the Emperor is very clerical.

It's a work marriage, so they treat each other like it, especially Louise.

So you treat it like a job, and you sigh at the emperor sulking.

"Whatever you're worried about, whatever you're scared of, it's not going to happen now, is it?"

According to Erich, no matter what Heinrich says, in the end, if there's nothing more than a formal relationship between the two of them, it's just something you shouldn't bother with.

"I don't know....... I don't know......."

5 years.

Five years.

In fact, Heinrich now thinks a little differently.

Is it true that my mother is going to age like that for the rest of her life?

I don't know that.

Naturally, since she's just reached the master class, Louise doesn't look much different from the other empresses.

Sometimes, Louise would say it with a sad look on her face when she realized that she was really annoyed.

'Don't worry, that's not going to happen in my lifetime ....... I wouldn't do something you don't like.

Heinrich felt like he'd been hit over the head, and of course, with all of his actions and demeanor, Louise was bound to feel the pressure.

Not to be outdone, Ruiz said in his own words.

I felt like I was being harsh.

After that, Heinrich didn't know what to do.

"By the way, officially, that....... Reinhard is Heinrich's father......?"

"I'm not sure about that, but......."

"......Now, that's enough. Please."

Heinrich's forehead broke out in a cold sweat as he asked for a favor like he was the king of Cernstadt.

Luckily, it was a good time to change the mood.

Kliffman, who had been dancing with Riana, sat her down at Harriet's table, heard something, and started walking over.

"It's been a while."

Everyone was happy to see Cliff pull up a chair and sit down.

They may be part of the same empire, but they all have their own agendas.

So it was rare to see everyone in the same room.

"How's everything going?"

Everyone nods appropriately at Kliffman's words.

As the King of Cernstadt, Heinrich naturally resides in the capital of Cernstadt.

Erich de Lapaeri became a paladin, a member of the Crusader Knights of the Holy Empire.

Cliffman is the full-time bodyguard to Riana, the head of the Empire's agricultural district.

The Agricultural District is important, but before that, Liana de Granz is irreplaceable, which is why she has only the overwhelmingly powerful Cliff as her escort, even among the Empire's master classes.

"If rehabilitation is work, I'm doing it."

Caierdo smiles and nods.

Unsurprisingly, Kaier is not yet out of his wheelchair and relies on Redina's help to get around.

"I'm worried about the next one."

But even when his rehabilitation is complete, there is no place for Kaiir. Neither his gift of giant powers nor his inability to wield them.

If there is a war, we may end up using arc crystals again, and then we'll have something else to do, but we'd rather not.

Konorint shakes his head in disbelief at Kaier's words.

"Hey, you'll be fine for the rest of your life on your pension."

"Yeah, but that's not true of you either."

"Uh, yeah."

There are only a handful of people who receive the highest level of meritorious service pension, but they have all achieved that level of specialization.

Of course, there are those who have turned down meritorious service pensions.

"By the way, this thing called a veteran's pension, are they really giving it out?"

Currently, the pension is only available to war heroes, but the long-term plan is to extend it to all veterans.

Although this is highly unlikely.

Heinrich narrows his eyes thoughtfully at Erich's words.

"I can't give it to you right away, but I plan to give it to you someday, though I'm not sure when that will happen. I'm also considering giving it to you as an estate, which Reinhardt seems to be against."

"Why don't you give it to me as an estate, isn't that better?"

"There is a lot of empty land in the world, and if you give someone a territory, they have to develop it by themselves, but is that a reward? If you say you're going to develop an empty land, it's a territory without any merit. If you say, "I gave you a territory and that's it," you'll only get backlash. It's as bad as not giving it."

"Oh, right."

While we don't yet have a pension for every veteran, there are certainly those who do.

And gradually expanding the scope of that pension is one of the Empire's long-term challenges.

At the end of the day, we've all done something big in our own way, and we've all earned our place.

"What's up with you?"

Klippmann looks at Kono Lint.

"Not really?"

Konorint shrugs.

"Well, it's a situation where it's best if you don't have anything to say."

At that, everyone but Lint nods.

Of course, Kono Lint has its place.

"I'm kind of surprised that we're doing anything, especially Heinrich being king, but honestly, I'm more surprised that you're doing it."

"Right."

"Uh."

"That's true. How is that possible?"

The others nodded vigorously in agreement with Kliffman.

"......what the fuck."

Lindt's eyes widen with trepidation.

"No, you're an Imperial Intelligence officer, this doesn't make sense."

Kono Lint was now one of the highest ranking officers in the Empire's spy squad, or intelligence service.

"The creepiest thing is that I spent three years pretending to be an idiot on that topic."

I've even been careful to hide the fact that I'm doing it from my friends.

When I was asked, with a hint of concern, if I should get a job, I cheerfully responded that I was going to live on a pension for the rest of my life.

"This asshole is being devious by pretending he's not?"

"I'm a person whose work ethic is to keep secrets, you sneaky......!"

A man who is surprisingly good at keeping secrets.

A thorough guy, even a little creepy.

My friends were the most shocked to learn that Kono Lint wasn't actually a puzzle.

Heinrich chuckles over a glass of champagne.

"But the way you really got found out....... kind of, like, you."

"What's like me......! What's like me......!"

Heinrich pressed the seizure button, and Kono Lint turned bright red and let out a stifled yell.

Everyone else chuckled, knowing what was going on, and Kono Lint bit his lip in frustration.

Kono Lint, who hid his membership in the Imperial Intelligence Service from even those closest to him, was found out in a fairly bizarre way.

"My deductive skills came into play."

Kono Lint was so thorough that Erich, the least intelligent man in the room, found out he was in the Secret Service.

Yo was.

Erich visited Kono Lint from time to time, who was living a life of leisure.

And then I looked.

Kono Lint goes on a date with a ghostly young woman.

He couldn't interfere right away, so he left, leaving Erich to find out later, and when Erich asked who the woman was, Kono Lindt answered briefly.

Girlfriend.

Naturally, Erich didn't believe him.

Erich sought out Klippmann to discuss the urgent and ridiculous fact.

Is this possible.

I turned to Riana, who was with me.

It's probably Sarkhegar, Dreadfind, the Archdemon of Shapeshifting.

And since Sarkeghar is a member of the Secret Service, Kono Lint must also be a member of the Secret Service.

So they were probably talking about work, not dating.

We don't actually know because Riana has no ties to the Agency, but Sarkegardo and Kono Lindt are also high ranking members of the Agency.

A long-kept secret has been blown too wide open.

"No way, no how."

It wasn't exactly deduction, but in the end, Erich's absolute faith that nothing like that would happen to his friend led him to unlock the secrets of Lint.

"Why......? I can't....... Why shouldn't I......?"

"Why in the world would an average-looking girl go out with you?"

"You can do it......!"

"No. There's no way, no way, no way that could happen unless you're a coworker demon."

There's no such thing as luck, Kaeir shook his head.

Conor Lint squirms in frustration.

"You motherfuckers......! I'm saying this in hindsight, but I wasn't really talking about work then......!"

Eventually, an exasperated Lint said something that got everyone's attention.

"!!!!"

And Konorint froze, realizing what he had said.

"......?"

"Uh......."

"Uh, yeah......?"

Sudden silence.

"What I don't understand at all is....... not."

"Oh, no, I was talking about work....... I was talking about work."

I tried to pick it up, but it was too late.

Everyone had heard something so serious that they were at a loss for words.

"Hmm....... Oh, well, it's all good for you anyway, isn't it? The, uh, bad guy....... No, I thought I heard you say you weren't even a bad demon....... No, that's a bit of a stretch......."

Heinrich broke out in a cold sweat, and the others nodded in agreement.

Erich mumbles to himself.

"You bastard, it's impossible to marry a beautiful woman after all, so why not marry a demon who could be any beautiful woman......."

"No, no, no......!"

Just like that.

Lint tries to deny it vehemently.

"Mr. Lint."

"......!"

Kono Lint felt a hand on his shoulder and opened his eyes.

There, one of the maids of honor was looking at Kono Lint with a gentle smile on her face.

Nearby, one of the maids, who has been quietly surveying the banquet, filling glasses, and clearing plates, suddenly puts her hand on a banquet attendee.

To do such a thing out of nowhere means that the handmaiden in front of you deserves it.

"If not, then what?"

Under that gaze, Kono Lindt froze, looking like he was about to bite his tongue.

And everyone else in the room froze.

I don't know what's going on.

One of those situations where you have no idea what's going on, and then you find out.

"And....... Me, me....... spying on me....... were you......?"

Kono Lint was a stickler for secrecy, not because he was a devious and manipulative person, after all.

We didn't know when or where Sarkegar would be watching.

"I told you, Mr. Lint......?"

The handmaiden's beautiful mouth curves up in an arc.

"All the time, watching."

No one could tell if it was affection, obsession, or just a watchful eye to keep him from making fun of her.

"You didn't keep your mouth shut, so you're going to get your ass kicked again like last time......?"

"Sin, sin, I'm sorry......."

But if nothing else, it was clear that Sarkegaard was enjoying Kono Lint's reaction.
