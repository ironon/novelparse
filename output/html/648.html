            Episode 648.





The battle is over.

As always with big city raids, it was a matter of clearing out the corpses of the monsters and killing the survivors.

But that role was now being fulfilled by Immortal.

It's an army that never tires and can die and rise again.

As such, the outskirts of the garrison were now occupied by Immortal knights and mages patrolling the battlefield and dealing with any monsters that might have survived.

Soon.

The area outside of Luboten is both an Allied garrison and Immortal territory.

It was a place completely out of the reach of the living.

A person who is now unable to tell if they are alive or dead.

-pook!κΈ°κΈ....... 껙!

Ellen chopped off the mole-like creature's head as it leapt out of hiding and lunged at her.

But from the severed head of the mole monster, jet-black blood poured toward Ellen.

From the color of the blood, it was clear that it was a dangerous substance that should not be touched.

Claws and teeth aren't the only dangers of monsters.

But the blood never made it to Ellen.

-qiibin!

Before it could reach Ellen's body, or even her Auror armor, a shroud of flame from the sun's cloak vaporized the mole's blood before it could reach her.

"......."

Even without the two orbs, Ellen is strong.

However, Voidblade Rament and Infernal Rapelt complete Ellen.

Rafelt's Voidblade, shaped like a cutout of the night sky, slashes through everything it touches.

And the sun cloak, which could have unleashed hellfire, is now a weapon to protect the user.

Rapport detects a "threat.

Even the strongest of humanity, those who have made it to the master class, have fallen victim to the unpredictable threat of monsters.

However, when Rafelt awakens to his true power, he defends Ellen from every attack that threatens her, whether she knows it or not.

As if an all-knowing deity is watching over you.

If the monsters' breath is dangerous, stop their breath, and if their blood is dangerous, stop their blood.

Whatever it is, if it's a "threat," it's blocked.

A sword that cuts through anything.

A shield against anything.

The perfection of the workshop makes Ellen Artorius a warrior.

So even in the most dangerous parts of the battlefield, even if it's a monster that's beyond common sense, Rafelt will always protect Ellen.

Because she can cut through anything and withstand any attack, Ellen goes into the most dangerous places.

But it's not always about slaying giant monsters.

Even a small monster like this is dangerous to someone.

That's why Ellen is possessed even after the battle is over, wandering the outskirts of the battlefield in search of monsters even though no one has ordered her to.

The first to enter the battlefield, the last to leave.

Even now that she was a puppet, Ellen was doing the same things she had always done.

So, we all know that Ellen is weird, but we don't know "how weird".

I didn't say much, and I didn't do much differently.

"Immortal will take care of this, why do you need to do this?"

Ellen turns slowly at the sound of a voice behind her.

"Why don't you get some rest?"

It was Christina with two soldiers and two mages.

"......."

Ellen stares at Christina for a moment.

Christina shook her head.

"I thought it was a little too flavored, but you're really weird."

"......."

"What's going on?"

Ellen didn't answer Christina's question.

"Are you mute or something?"

Despite Christina's prodding for a response, Ellen remained silent.

Christina narrows her brow as she stares at Ellen, who is still, unresponsive, a doll.

"What are you, turned in a different way than I am?"

"......."

It's the ones who end up broken after horrible things.

Those who are still intact are too strong.

Having spent time in some of the most horrific, nasty places, it's no wonder Ellen is broken.

So, it's going to look like this because it's broken in some way.

She only thinks so.

Ellen didn't respond to my continued sarcastic remarks.

He doesn't seem offended at all.

It doesn't even appear to ignore it.

Looking at Ellen, who doesn't respond, Christina frowns.

But Ellen doesn't leave.

All I could do was stare at her.

"I'm an asshole in a very different sense than I used to be."

"......."

"Well, okay, I actually came to you with a proposal."

Ellen is still silent.

"You know Immortal, don't you?"

For the first time, we have a reaction that feels like a reaction.

-nod

"Oh, you're listening, aren't you?"

It's a simple way of communicating that she's nodding, but eventually Christina realizes that Ellen is listening.

"I'm not going to go into a long explanation, you're busy."

Christina laughs.

"Be my hostage."

At Christina's evil grin, Ellen stares.

"Because if I have you, I'm definitely going to get in your face."

It will try to get it back somehow.

If you have Ellen, there is someone who will come to you.

It's hiding somewhere, poisoning you, and you don't even know where it is.

It is impossible for any being to search the entire world.

If you hide forever, you will never be found.

As such, you'll need to make sure that you have a sacrifice to summon the demon.

"Ellen, I need you to be bait for the devil."

"......."

Christina smiles.

Hostage.

I don't intend to stop there.

"Of course, when the devil came looking for you......."

She starts laughing, as if she's having fun imagining it.

"It would be irreversible."

The moment the devil showed up to save the hostages.

What the demon will see is not a living Ellen Artorius, but an immortalized Ellen.

What would the Devil say to Ellen, who had already died an irreversible death and was now a shell of her former self?

Feeling deprived.

The feeling of facing something irreversible.

I thought I'd make him feel the same way.

"Grab it."

Christina commands.

It was already a shell, and I couldn't imagine trying to make it a shell again.



* * *



It didn't take long.

About 30 seconds.

One immortal uses a sword, another uses magic.

That's all it took for the Immortal Four to be neutralized by having their heads blown off, snapped in half, or their backs severed.

The Voidblade cuts through everything it touches.

And all attacks are neutralized by Rafelt.

In the face of the Voidblade, even the Master Class's Auror Armor is a mere drop in the ocean in front of the blade.

Nothing short of a holy object can withstand the cutting power of a Voidblade.

So Ellen just swung, and it was blocked.

Christina watched, wide-eyed, as the fallen Immortal disappeared in a flash of light.

Is this enough?

The Immortal that Christina brings with her is also one of the best in Immortals.

Ancient heroes who reached the rank of grandmaster couldn't last 30 seconds in front of Ellen.

If these four can be neutralized so easily, it is unlikely that any other immortals could be brought in and the result would be any different.

"What is......?"

Ellen had sliced through two Grandmasters and two Archmages and could only stare at Christina.

Christina realized.

The absurdity of holy objects.

Ellen is Ellen, but it's a holy object.

I couldn't help but feel the absurdity of that Voidblade Ramen.

Ellen clearly reacted to the attacks being made on her.

Ellen, having subdued the Immortals, begins to walk slowly toward Christina.

As Ellen approaches, Christina steps back and casts her spell.

Call an immortal.

-Flash!

In response to Christina's will, dozens of Immortals begin to travel short distances through space to intercept Ellen.

But it didn't make sense.

-Circling!

With a single swing of the Voidblade, the Immortal is cut down along with his Auror armor.

-Kwalung!

Thunderbolt and Charge are blocked by a shroud of flames.

This creates a ridiculous situation where the fire stops the charge.

"Does this....... Does this make sense......?"

-Quack!

Not swords, not magic, not Ellen's Auror armor, not even the barrier of flame she wears.

The Voidblade, however, slashes everything in its path.

That was a mistake.

The devil is not the problem.

Ellen was the problem.

No force of arms, no magic, will be of any consequence before Ellen Artorius, wielding the Voidblade and wearing the Cloak of Infernal Fire.

The only reason we've been able to tolerate Ellen so far is because she retains her humanity.

It is impossible to bring the unflinching Ellen Artorius to her knees by force.

Christina realizes.

After all, an alchemist is an alchemist.

He was all about his lab and his desk.

I've never been in a fight, and I've never watched a fight.

With over a thousand archmages and master classes at my fingertips, I thought there was nothing that wouldn't fall before me.

Why a warrior is a warrior.

What the heck a holy object is.

You know it in your head, but you haven't seen it with your eyes.

The twenty Immortals she had summoned had already been neutralized and disappeared at a rate not unlike the first.

Christina sees Ellen walking toward her in a daze.

It's not that urgent.

As if to say, if you want to run away, run away.

Tighten slowly.

The moment she finally decides to leave.

-shhh!

Before she knew it, Ellen had reached out and grabbed Christina's throat with one hand.

Ellen's movements aren't something you'd see and recognize from a desk bite you've never fought.

"Turn off...... Yuck!"

A skilled Battlemage might be able to cast Spatial Shift on a pain in the neck, but that's not the case for Christina.

Battlemage is the path of choice for the less talented mages.

For the elite class of mages, there is no reason to have any real combat experience.

So it's no wonder that Christina can't see or react to Ellen's movements, and that she can't use magic in her pain.

All the formulas you've been thinking about are being thrown out of whack as your breathing gets harder and harder.

I'm choking.

Sick.

I think I'm going to die.

How can I work my magic calmly when all I can think about is that?

How do Battlemages do that?

Christina realizes how difficult it was to do something so trivial.

How powerless you are.

By the time you realize how arrogant it was to step in front of Ellen, it's too late.

The arrogance of an alchemist who wasn't even a battlemage, let alone a battlemage, to believe in the power of the Immortals was unspeakable, and Ellen was demonstrating it with her actions.

Being grabbed by the scruff of the neck was enough to shut down all magic, and I could no longer call upon the Immortals.

How to call an immortal is also magic.

"Off......."

As her breathing tightens, Christina struggles against Ellen's fingers, which are twisted around her throat.

But even with all her strength, Ellen couldn't move a single finger.

In the face of an overwhelming power differential, everything else is irrelevant.

Even the Immortals have been swept away by the Voidblade, so there's no way Christina can control Ellen's fingers.

"I, Lord, if you kill me....... regret....... will......?"

In the end, Ellen could only stare at the ugly figure making such miserable threats.

And just like that, just before she passed out.

-Hair

Ellen abruptly let go of Christina.

"K...... huh! huh! huh! huh! huh! huh!"

Ellen stares down at Christina, who's sobbing uncontrollably on the floor.

It was an emotionless stare.

It's not even a look of disdain, like looking down at trash.

"Hmph! Black! Hmph!"

Exhaling and inhaling several times, she still couldn't escape.

You need to run away.

You need to run away.

It's all in my head, but the magic keeps failing.

I'm not even strangling anymore.

I couldn't work my magic because of the pressure and fear.

How the hell did you do this.

How can magic be used in combat?

How do we do that?

How can a human be so strong?

Christina was horrified as her body experienced what she knew in her head.

No matter how justified the anger, no matter how justified the hatred.

The weak are the weak and the strong are the strong.

Those who don't know the fight, don't know the fight.

You can buy it, you can scheme it, but you have to keep it on topic.

If you don't know what you're talking about, you're in for a rough ride.

Ellen stares at Christina, crumpled up like a piece of trash, gasping for air, completely incapacitated by a single, brief blockage in her airway.

And then Ellen's mouth, which hadn't been able to open until now, opens.

"It's still useful."

"Off......!"

-chiiiiing!

Christina couldn't hear a word of what was coming out of Ellen's mouth.

It's a small voice.

However, it had an uncanny resonance, like a mix of tens of thousands of voices.

Christina writhes in pain, as the voice itself seems to tear at her brain.

This is just a small fraction of what Ellen has endured.

But Christina could not bear the overwhelming sound of the spirits, not even the sound of their voices, and she could only cower and tremble.

"I'll let you live."

"Ugh!"

Ellen had become something Christina couldn't imagine.

Even simple violence.

Even a simple voice.

She couldn't handle it.

The only good thing is that she didn't pay for her arrogance with her life.

Ellen returned to the Allied garrison, leaving a stunned Christina on the ground where the monster's corpse lay.
