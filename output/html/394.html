            Episode 394.





I don't know much about the Kamsencha archipelago, but it's clear that marine products are a specialty here.

"I felt it last time, but what's so big?"

Herriot's eyes widened as he looked at the giant lobster that had been cooked.

"Bigger is better."

"What's not to like about growing up with ...... as long as it's something to eat?"

"Well."

"Just saying."

Most restaurants were selling seafood dishes, and the prices were very cheap for the ecliptic. We started with a buttered lobster, about five times the size of a typical lobster, and dipped our forks into it.

"Mmmm, I haven't had it in a long time, so I guess it tastes like that!"

Herriot smiled happily and shivered. I've always felt that way, but she's a reactionary. Come to think of it, she didn't eat much else, but she did eat lobster.

I think giving him my share when I was hungry for more helped mend my relationship with him.

-Omnomnomnom

Ellen was eating eagerly, as if she had time for one more word.

If you think about it, the ocean near the uninhabited islands was overflowing with seafood, including lobsters and octopus. Given the abundance of marine resources, the Kamsencha Archipelago could have made a living distributing such seafood through warp gates.

I guess the tourist resources aren't bad, but maybe the deserted island we went to was a little special.

I hadn't eaten lunch either, but it was interesting to see Ellen eating a giant lobster, even though it's something I see all the time. Harriet, well, she's eating with the grace and elegance of an aristocrat, teasing her fork, but Ellen is a fast eater.

Ellen was wearing a white dress.

It looks like she's eating nonstop, but Ellen is careful not to get any on her dress.

Despite eating steadily, Ellen's clothes didn't get a bit of food on them until she finally finished the lobster.

"I don't know if eating without getting buried counts as a talent, but you do."

"......."

"No, I'm just saying that I eat pretty clean, so why is your mouth sticking out?"

Isn't that technically a compliment?

I didn't say it's amazing that you can eat that stuff and not get buried!

"I got in trouble a lot back in the day."

"...... Oh yeah?"

"I won't blame you for eating a lot, but don't get buried and eat it. To Daddy."

"I can't really imagine Ellen getting yelled at......."

Ellen's father.

Did you look at your daughter and tell her to stop eating, that it's all good, but don't bury it and eat it, while swallowing back tears of blood?

"So, getting buried and eating is a product of hard work, not talent?"

"Yes."

Somehow, I'm not hating on him for eating like that, because I've put in the work.

It's kind of cute.

This was the first time I'd ever heard Ellen get in trouble for eating in the past, so it was kind of refreshing. In retrospect, it was around this time last year that Ellen and I started sharing food when I caught her gorging herself on jerky in the wee hours of the morning.

Although we didn't do the mission ourselves, being on Kamsencha Island brought back memories of last year. Ellen and Harriet seemed to be doing the same.

"I was really scared when it suddenly rained."

Herriot shuddered at the memory.

I knew it was raining, but it's one thing to know it's raining, it's another thing to be caught in it. I must have brought her back to my den when it was blown away and she was shivering.

Herriot's eyes grew wistful, as if he was reminiscing.

"Why, if I really wanted to, I could find a deserted island somewhere and do it one more time with properties until Sunday."

"When did you say we were going to do this again?!"

Memories are memories, and I don't want to do it all over again, Herriot said.

"If I did it again, I don't think I'd do it much differently."

Ellen said.

Herriot, who had been concentrating hard to create a single fireball, now had a near-instant casting ability.

Ellen was still a fighter, but now she could be enchanted.

That sturdy orc could now be attacked by dozens of them and still be sliced to pieces with just a little ramen.

Hunting, gathering, and surviving would be easier than ever.

"Okay, that's not as hard as it used to be."

Herriot nodded in agreement. Something that would have been a death sentence once upon a time, if she were to face it again, she would be able to shrug it off like it was no big deal.

A lot of things have been made easier.

So I know it won't be as hard as it used to be, but it won't be as fulfilling either.

Herriot didn't look too happy.



* * *



Kamsencha is a vacation spot, so there were quite a few people coming and going.

There were quite a few tourists on the white sandy beach with emerald blue waters against a clear blue sky.

If the water was half people and half water, it would have been a little awkward, but thankfully it wasn't. There were a few people lying on sunbeds under parasols, and some bungalows set up on the beach.

Ellen stared at the beach, then ran her hand down the skirt of her dress.

-Hullo!

"Eh, Ellen!"

"What are you doing....... Oh, are you wearing?"

"Yes."

Ellen was wearing a bikini, which she had thrown on as soon as she bought it. Harriet freaked out when Ellen suddenly tried to undress her, then breathed a sigh of relief when she realized she was wearing a blue swimsuit.

"Me too....... I'm going to go change into my swimsuit."

Harriet went to the changing rooms set up on the beach, and I went to change into my swimsuit.

It was still early spring and the sun was shining, unlike the chilly ecliptic.

It was gorgeous weather and scenery.

But I have something to say today.

So, no matter what I looked at, I didn't feel very good about it.



* * *



I went swimming.

We swam a little differently than everyone else. Herriot cast an underwater breathing spell on all three of us, and we could go out to sea as far as we could scuba dive.

So how many people were on the beach didn't really matter to us in the first place. We're not on the beach, we're offshore, we're out in the ocean, we're almost like doing underwater exploration, we're barely out of the water.

In missions, I'd come into the ocean to hunt, but now I was swimming purely for fun.

There were some hiccups.

Or Ellen freaks out at a shark that appears out of nowhere and summons Ramen to intercept it.

Or that Herriot was suddenly caught in a downward tide, plunged to the bottom of the ocean, and was forced up by magically creating a current.

In retrospect, there were some risky things that happened, but everyone was capable, so it didn't matter.

I ended up spending the day in the water without incident, getting out, resting, and getting back in.

Night time.

We had dinner at a nearby restaurant. Harriet was exhausted, and in the midst of eating her dinner, she collapsed on the table.

Ellen and I are actually less active than usual, so we had some energy left over.

"Dinner is dinner, and what are you going to do? If you're going to sleep here, I think you should find a place to sleep."

Tomorrow is Sunday, so you don't have to go back today.

"I'm not going anywhere....... I don't want to sleep in a strange place....... I'm not going anywhere......."

Judging by the way Herriot, stretched out like a jellyfish, was mumbling to himself, it was clear that he was beyond drained.

"Well, let's find a place to rest."

"Ugh....... Thanks......."

Ellen stroked Herriot's head as she did so.



* * *



Finding a place to rest was easy. Instead of staying in an inn, I rented a bungalow on the beach. Since I could afford it, and since it was a tourist destination, I was able to find a good place to stay. The bedrooms were all separate, so I knew I wouldn't be in any awkward situations.

Our fairly large overwater bungalow even had a pool, albeit a small one.

But we'd been in the water all day, and it was night, so we were more likely to sit and stare at the ocean after getting cleaned up and changed than swim.

"I never thought I'd be in this place until this morning."

"Me too."

While the warp gate allows us to travel long distances, it's not often that we actually get to do so. Herriot looks at me and Ellen, smiling as if he's remembered something.

"Heh, if Riana was here, I'd ask her for a drink......."

Herriot said, and then froze.

Definitely.

At night, after coming to a place like this, Riana would have asked for a drink. But now, Riana has become the kind of girl who says she's busy when asked to go out, and even if she did come, she wouldn't ask for a drink.

Things have changed, people have changed, and behavior has changed.

We sat on the terrace, the three of us, in a daze.

"It's only been a year, and so much has changed."

Herriot muttered, head down, a hint of melancholy in his voice.

Once a haughty duchess, Herriot has softened, but she has also learned to love melancholy.

Ellen vowed never to live like her brother, but now she understands him.

After the death of her father, Riana was freed from a life of idleness.

A lot has changed.

And not to mention me. I'm forced to be a warrior because I have a holy relic, and that was true of Ellen, too.

This change has been both positive and negative.

They've all changed in some way, but the common thread is that they're all stronger than the original.

And because they all felt the threat of the demon, they were all desperate to some degree.

"If everything had stayed the same....... that wouldn't have been so bad."

Herriot mumbles something incoherent.

Riana is still lazy, I'm still an asshole, and Ellen just likes to eat dumplings.

No need to be strong, no pressure to be strong.

I wish it would just stay that way. Harriet says this from her bungalow in this calm, serene, vacation spot.

Ellen put a hand on Harriet's shoulder and held her still.

"We'll be fine. Whatever."

Anything will work.

That everything will be fine.

As if soothing a child, Ellen whispers softly to Harriet. Herriot puts his hand on Ellen's arm, still, and nods.

To Ellen, who believes everything will be okay. To Harriet.

I should say, from now on.

You can't put it off forever.

-chirrrrr

The sound of grasshoppers could be heard from the shore.

Just as it is eternally winter in the castle of Epirus, it will be eternally summer here.

The sun beats down on the ocean and coastline year-round, and it's probably always going to look like this.

There is no eternal winter and no eternal summer for me.

I don't know what to call the seasons I've been through since arriving at Temple.

"Hey, I have something to tell you guys....... to tell you guys."

From now on, you'll have to live with a different season.



* * *



The explanation was long-winded.

But when I said the key word, I couldn't help but see their faces harden.

An engagement thrown out of the blue.

Naturally, Harriet and Ellen didn't know what I was talking about. Suddenly, they were engaged.

I explained myself. I was making each other feel weird and terrible, but I couldn't help it.

I couldn't explain everything, but I could give you a general idea of what was going on.

After returning from Demon Castle, Charlotte was experiencing something of an after-effect.

How I risked my life to save Charlotte.

And Charlotte, who can barely keep up with her own health, has fallen behind in the race to the throne and now has her own faction turning against her.

To the point where Bertus isn't the problem, but rather a renegade from within who may endanger your life.

So, I need a reason to protect her, so I betroth her to me, the owner of Alsbringer, to prevent her from alienating her supporters, so that she can survive.

No one asked him why he was going out of his way for Charlotte.

I didn't say that I was forced to make this choice to save Charlotte's life.

I want to keep Charlotte because I love her, and I want to marry her because I love her, and that's the way it's going to be for both of us, and I'm not going to say no to that.

They'll take that as a given.

I made a choice.

Trying to fumble with something else is just plain silly.

"......a."

Herriot stared at me, frozen, dumbfounded.

-Took

Ellen's face was expressionless, just a single tear rolling down her cheek.

I didn't say sorry, because that's even weirder.

The moment you say you're sorry, things will only get weirder, and everyone will feel even worse than they already do.

With that said, I stared out at the ocean.

The gentle waves were constantly crashing onto the shore.

Ellen said nothing, just kept her head down.

Herriot looks at Ellen, and then at me, forcing himself to make a face.

It was a strange look, one that I don't know what to call.

"He, yeah. He....... You, ha....... He...... made it big....... How come....... How did something like you....... How did......."

Finally, as she tries to say something, Herriot's face contorts into a miserable grimace.

"How did....... replace....... Why......."

Herriot was crying, and I couldn't look him in the eye.

Ellen, her head bowed, said nothing.

"Were you lying?"

In a very small voice, he said something like that.

It didn't say what it was about.

But I know what moment you're talking about.

The day they handed me the rappel.

I reject that.

What he said next.

It's the story of the day.

I knew what I was going to say.

"......."

Ellen didn't ask any more questions.
