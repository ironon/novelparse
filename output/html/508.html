After saying goodbye to Herriot, Ellen returned to the garrison.

"I'll be waiting for you in two days, at midnight, in the fields south of the garrison.

Ellen doesn't know what she's supposed to do specifically, but Herriot leaves her with those words.

Ellen was afraid and curious about the fate that awaited her.

But perhaps he will cease to exist, or perhaps he will assimilate into the alien spirits and become the very will that hates the demon and kills Reinhardt.

Ellen realizes that this is a choice that could lead to Reinhardt's death.

But if you don't make that choice, Reinhardt might die right now.

The price of saving Reinhardt now may be killing him later with my own hands.

Just as Reinhard didn't have a choice, Ellen didn't have a choice.

Knowing that he couldn't handle it, that it would destroy the whole of Edina, Reinhardt tried to lock the thoughts inside of him.

Like him, Ellen has no choice but to take the path she must take now, even though she knows it will lead to her ruin later.

If you can blend in with the rest of the world and become a demon-hating warrior, people will love you.

It's about overcoming the disparity between reality and the ideal in a completely strange way.

I'm not at all willing to do that.

I have no intention of letting my existence fade away.

It's just a matter of not running into them.

Even if you're a warrior who wants to kill the demon, if you can't find it after the gate situation is resolved, you won't be able to fight it even if you want to.

Ellen crossed the garrison and returned to her tent.

Inside the tent, Ellen sits dazedly on her cot.

What it's like to cease to exist.

Ellen doesn't know what death is, because she's never been dead.

So Ellen doesn't know what it is to be alive and not be alive.

They don't know how to defend their existence.

However, we can save Reinhardt.

Ellen decided to think only about that.

Also.

We can see Reinhardt once again.

Ellen holds still and steals a glance. Her stolen hand was wet.

"......."

Ellen carefully steals a few tears from her eyes.

It was a situation where you had to meet them as an enemy and treat them as an enemy.

He despaired that one day he would see Reinhardt again, and that it would be inevitable that they would have to fight for each other's lives.

But instead of facing them as enemies, the reunion is to save Reinhardt.

I can't tell you how grateful, thankful, and thrilled I am for that.

Even if it's the last time we ever meet.



* * *



Since the continent is full of monsters, an army's march will travel a certain distance, clear the area, set up a garrison, clear it, and move on.

Therefore, once a garrison is established, there is time to ensure that the marching route is properly secured.

It also takes time to set up and take down garrisons.

So even in the midst of a tight marching schedule, there is time for rain, and before the garrison was dismantled and the march began, Ellen had some free time.

Two days later, when most of the soldiers were asleep, except for night patrols and guards.

Ellen arrived alone, at the time and place Herriot said she would, at the time and place Herriot said she would.

There, Harriet was waiting for Ellen.

"There you are, Ellen."

Harriet was still looking at Ellen with sad eyes.

There was no one else in the field but Herriot.

Just as Reinhardt so casually sacrificed himself to protect Edina.

Ellen, too, is willing to sacrifice herself without a second thought when told that she can save Reinhardt.

I think I'm ready for that, and so does Herriot.

But that didn't mean I could take it for granted when I saw someone else's willingness to sacrifice so casually.

I don't want to lose Reinhardt, so I sacrifice Ellen.

This is a suggestion from Antrianus, Lord of Toyo.

We all know there's a lot of malice in that suggestion.

But it's also true that everyone agreed to the proposal.

Ellen would naturally be willing to sacrifice herself for Reinhardt, and she's going to be fighting a demon later anyway.

Because there's no one in Edina who can afford it.

Everyone agreed to the cruel plan to make a real enemy out of someone who was going to be an enemy anyway.

Once you agree to Antirrhinus' plan, no one is immune to its malice.

The anguish, self-loathing, and guilt that the others who agreed to sacrifice Ellen would feel would be exactly what Antony intended.

No one is free of the sin of sacrificing Ellen.

"We're going to a ceremonial place."

"Yes."

Blue energy lines began to emanate from Herriot's entire body, and soon he and Ellen were able to teleport to another location.

Ellen doesn't know what this place is like.

Just a place where a giant dust cloud is drawn.

Five beings stand on each axis of the circle.

Elise, the Gazoo of Tuesdays.

Gazoo of Demand, Lucinil.

Lerouen, Gazoo of Thursday.

Galarsh, the Gazoo of Friday.

Antirrhinus, Gazoo of Toyo.

Ellen didn't recognize everyone's faces, but she did recognize two.

When Ellen appeared with Harriet, I saw a glint of guilt in some of their eyes.

And the old man was smiling wryly at Ellen.

The look in his eyes gave Ellen the creeps.

That wasn't all.

In addition to Herriot and the Lord Vampires, Liana de Granz and Olivia Ranze were there.

In both cases, it was a face Ellen hadn't seen in a long time.

Neither Riana nor Olivia could look at Ellen properly.

Riana realizes that she is the cause of all of this.

He can't look at Ellen properly because he knows he can't handle even a fraction of what Reinhardt is going through.

In the midst of her mixed emotions, Olivia couldn't look at Ellen properly.

This isn't because Ellen can handle it, it's just a passing off.

Being an extraordinary being, there is a definite danger that the self may disappear, even if the body does not.

Does he even realize what's happening to him?

For the first time in her life, Olivia was feeling something akin to pity for Ellen.

We didn't really say hello.

It wasn't a situation where that was possible.

All eyes were on the center of the circle, where the five archmages stood.

Ellen isn't sure what the ritual means.

However, in the middle of it all.

There was an image of Reinhardt lying on what looked like a ceremonial altar.

You don't know if they're asleep or passed out.

Beside the altar, where Reinhardt lay unconscious, a pink-haired demon repeatedly flicked Reinhardt's forehead gently.

What Ellen doesn't know is that the Succubus Queen has purposely put Reinhardt to sleep so he won't wake up.

There are some faces in the room that Ellen recognizes and some that she doesn't.

There is no need to share a statement, the joy or sadness of reunion, or any other words.

"When you're ready, proceed to the center altar of Wenjin."

Lucinil, the silver-haired girl, was the only one to say so.

It was drawn by Lucinil, who has mastered the magic of working with spirits.

Lucinil has never practiced the magic of transferring souls to other bodies on this scale.

However, I crammed as much knowledge as I could into this article.

"Ellen......."

As Ellen started to head toward the source, Herriot called her back.

Liana de Granz and Olivia Lanchester watch Ellen.

None of the three could tell Ellen anything. No one knows how Ellen will change now that Reinhard has taken on his burden.

"...... I'm coming."

With those words, the meaning of which is unclear, Ellen leaves Harriet behind and walks toward the center of the circle.

When Ellen reached the altar, the pink-haired demon stood still and backed away from the circle.

Like leaving Reinhardt in charge.

Even through her pretense, Ellen could tell that Reinhardt was in very bad shape.

I could tell by his parched lips, pale complexion, and cold sweat on his forehead what he meant by dying.

"line......hart......."

Ellen sits down at the altar and embraces Reinhardt.

It was a different meeting.

Unlike his theatrical battles, Reinhardt was emaciated.

Ellen doesn't know what she's carrying or how heavy it is.

However, we have to deal with what Reinhardt is dealing with.

I'm up for it.

Reinhardt, whom Ellen had placed on her lap, was fast asleep.

-Start the ritual.

At the word of the silver-haired girl, the five Lord Vampires begin to start up something of an origin.

Olivia Ranze also keeps an eye on the ceremony, having summoned Tiamata just in case.

In the glowing dust, Ellen stares at Reinhardt's face.

I wonder if it's the last one.

I wonder if that's it.





I wanted to be able to do something for you, and I was able to.

It may not be the last.

But it might be the last time.

Ellen bows her head toward Reinhardt and kisses his forehead.

But how fortunate I am to be able to hold her like this.

How grateful we should be.

With that in mind.

Because it's the last one.

Because it's asleep.

What I wanted to say.

"That you're sick."

Until the last moment of consciousness.

I could go on and on.

Ellen looks at the unconscious Reinhardt with sadness in her eyes.

"The things that get you down."

During the ritual.

"I'll....... I'll take it all."

Ellen told Reinhard what she had wanted to tell him for so many years.

Feeling guilty and sorry.

And about favorite hearts.

"I love you so, so much."

It whispered for an eternity.



* * *



I often lost consciousness.

I didn't realize that my body and soul were getting sick and tired.

I thought that what I had to bear was what I had to bear.

There was no other way, or so I thought.

Someone had to take care of that giant black hole of aspiration that would multiply if left alone.

So in my dying moments, I knew I had to find another way, but I couldn't let go, so I gave my body away.

Airi said.

Wait, I need a good night's sleep.

In the depths of my unconscious, I'm trying to find some way to cure myself.

So, sleep soundly.

I didn't know how to do that.

I was just too tired, I was just too tired.

So I drifted off into a deep sleep with Airi's hand stroking my forehead.

Literally, it was a deathly sleep.

It was my dreams and subconscious that I couldn't really control, even with the powers of a succubus queen, but somehow I was able to fall asleep very deeply.

And then, in the abyss of that consciousness, I felt a bizarre sensation.

Something.

That sense of escaping.

The bizarre sensation of a dam of wastewater in my mind and soul, the walls of which are crumbling and suddenly it's all going somewhere.

The things that have been taking up most of my consciousness and trying to rear their ugly heads at every opportunity are fading away.

In that uncanny feeling of refreshment and release, where the pain of mind and body suddenly disappears, I felt myself slowly returning to consciousness.

"......."

The blurred vision slowly finds focus.

I am, embraced by something.

No matter how many times I blinked, the focus would not return.

I don't know how much time has passed or in whose arms I am now.

But from faint body odor and temperature and blurry shapes.

I was getting a familiar feeling.

"El......?"

Even as my vision returned, it didn't occur to me that it was anyone other than Ellen who was making me feel this familiarity.

Soon, someone came up and pulled me to my feet. As if to pull me out of his arms.

When I regained my vision, I couldn't make sense of the situation anymore.

Ellen sat in the center of the circle, a strange magic circle.

I couldn't help but realize that it was Ellen who had been hugging me all this time.

Ellen asks why?

Supporting me were Elise and Olivia.

What the heck was going on?

Before my eyes, unable to comprehend the situation, Ellen rises from the altar, still.

But Ellen's vibe was a little weird.

In the almost unfocused look in Ellen's eyes, I couldn't help but feel that something was wrong.

Like backing away from something you're afraid of, Elise and Olivia take a step back, holding me up.

"Oh my gosh, you've been holding out."

Ellen, mumbling to herself.

"This is what....... you've been dealing with, Reinhardt."

With a tone and demeanor that seemed to be holding something back, I could only slowly figure out what was going on.

"Now......."

I alternate between looking at Elise and Olivia.

"Now....... To Ellen....... To me......."

There was an indelible look of guilt on their faces.

"What....... did......?"

Olivia was biting her lip, and Elise was gritting her teeth.

I wonder if this is what it's like to be cut off from reason.

"You're asking me what I did!"

My cries were met with silence from both of them and everyone else standing around.

I don't know what it is, but I think I know what it is.

Why does my body feel so light, and why is my mind so clear when it has been foggy ever since I accepted it?

Why are Ellen's eyes so cloudy?

No way.

They took that.

Ellen, in the distance, purses her lips.

It was a bizarre behavior, but I couldn't help but cringe at the expression that formed at the end of the quivering of his lips.

With all the strength she has left, Ellen finally raises the corner of her mouth.

Ellen smiles at me.

As if it were the last.

"Hi, Reinhard."

Say goodbye as if this is the last time you will ever meet.

With that said, there's other magic at work in the source code.

-Flash!

With a flash of light, Ellen's form disappeared.

I slowly look around at the faces of the people in this room, in a space I don't recognize.

Load vampires.

Riana.

Olivia.

Herriot.

Airy.

No one dared to look me in the eye.

Only Antirhynchus stood still, staring at the spot where Ellen had disappeared with a look of satisfaction on his face.



* * *



Ellen Artorius appeared in a field south of the garrison where she had encountered Herriot.

At the end of the ritual, it was time to let Ellen go, as there was no telling what she might do with a large group of spirits in her body.

Ellen stood alone in the clearing where the night had fallen.

Ellen felt with her whole body, with her soul, what Reinhardt had been dealing with all this time.

Hate.

Vengeful.

The echoes of resentment, which seemed to take every negative emotion in the world and amplify it a million times over, were enough to make me lose my mind.

I wonder if I can afford this.

In the midst of this tidal wave of desire, can you remain yourself?

Is it possible to keep my heart for Reinhardt, floating like a sculpture, in the midst of such a huge wave of emotions?

The mind is so small that it will be swept away by the waves.

Ellen senses that her thinking is becoming tainted.

The devil must die.

The devil is the cause of everything.

There's no point in screaming that it's not.

With so many entities already in his soul, the truth that Ellen cries out is only drowned out by the waves of resentment.

These spirits could not enter the demon's body and kill him.

However, it has taken up residence in the body of a warrior, the demon's arch-enemy.

What difference does it make.

-Crrrr!

-knowwhat!

In the distance, you hear the cries of a monster.

Monsters are everywhere, and even when you've cleared a safe marching path, new ones are bound to pop up somewhere.

The scale is around seventy.

They all look different, but Ellen sees them coming toward her.

-Slurp!

As he pulls out the ramen, the Voidblade is colored by the darkness of the Abyss.

Like a projection of the night sky, the Voidblade Ramen is a little different than before, with galaxies and star clouds visible within.

Abyss.

The Voidblade, which projects only the abyss, shows that the sorrow Ellen feels is now so great that even the stars that shine in it are dead.

A sword that projects nothing but darkness, not the night sky.

Ellen grabs it and sees a swarm of monsters charging at her.

On such an Ellen's shoulders falls the cloak of the sun.

A sun god's cloak with protective powers.

The color of it was a little strange.

The sun god's cloak fluttered menacingly, as if projecting the sun's fiery inferno.

No, in fact, in the cloak of the sun, infernal flames begin to flicker and burn.

To add to the grief.

Hate.

Ellen stares at the swarm of monsters closing in.

-Kurung! Kureng!

As if animated, the flames were actually flowing out of the cloak.

The monsters didn't even come close to Ellen.

-Bang! Quack!

As if alive, a whip of flame extended from the sun's cloak, striking the earth, crushing and incinerating the monsters that had gathered.

Ellen watched as the dirt melted away with a single blow and the crimson flames gradually spread.

Immortalized by hatred.

A warrior carries the hatred and sorrow of men on his back.

The devil must die.

No, you can't.

In the vortex of the soul, as Reinhardt did.

The will of Ellen Artorius, too, begins to die.

But unlike killing the demon's spirit, which was meant to kill his body.

The spirits were imbuing Ellen Artorius with great power.

You must become stronger because you must kill the demon.

Therefore, unlike when they possessed other beings, the spirits did not try to destroy Ellen.

In fact, in some ways, it empowers her.

Ellen reaches up to the sky.

-Bang! Quack! Kwagagagagang!

The surviving monsters are incinerated by fireballs raining down from the sky.

Earth-melting flames.

Flame of Hatred.

"......."

Ellen Artorius became the master of that hatred.
