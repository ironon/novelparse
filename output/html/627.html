"Ewww....... Eek!"

"Ask this."

"Oof! Oof! Oof!"

-Oops!

Louis Ankton watched, wide-eyed, as Ludwig smashed his gag to bite down on the pain.

"It's going to hurt."

-ChiyiBenefit!

As Christina poured the mysterious solution on Ludwig's shoulder, there was a sound as if something was burning and black smoke began to rise.

"Ouch! ugh. Ugh....... Ugh!"

Ludwig's exposed right arm was glowing with darkness.

Ludwig's eyes were red and bloodshot as he tried to stifle the groan that kept escaping him, and the junction of his right arm and shoulder was oozing a steady stream of black, dead blood.

Christina was doing something to Ludwig's arm with a determined look on her face, and Anna was using her magic to keep him from struggling.

-Kaduk! carddup!

But the magic that bound Ludwig was also subject to being broken and re-cast by the simple physical forces of his body.

Unable to use magic himself, Louis Ankton was able to get the necessary reagents, medicines, and scrolls to Christina and Anna just in time.

"Hmph....... ugh....... Ugh!"

"Just a little more, it's almost over."

It's unbearable for humans.

Despite being given a lethal dose of painkillers, which would have made it difficult for a normal human being to respond to pain, Ludwig's mind was pushed to the limit.

A normal, healthy arm would have been rejected.

But it wasn't just any human arm, it was an arm that had been enhanced with black magic, technically a giant piece of magic itself.

Ludwig, who should have died of shock the moment he was transplanted, hangs on because his life force is uncannily strong.

As if protected by some inscrutable force, Ludwig somehow managed to withstand a painful rejection that would have killed a normal person a hundred times over without that level of vitality.

It wasn't until Ludwig's body broke out in a cold sweat, as well as Anna and Christina, who control his rejection, that Ludwig's condition returned.

"Are you feeling better now?"

Christina asked, looking at Ludwig, who was shirtless and covered in sweat.

"Yeah....... Now that's bearable."

The three listeners know that Ludwig's words are false.

The pain is only alleviated, but it never goes away.

It's just that it's not a screaming pain, and Ludwig can't help but feel the burning pain in the joints of his right arm all the time.

Ludwig's skinny right arm was hard to recognize as belonging to a living person.

And the veins bulging between his right arm and shoulder were all colored red.

Like a right arm eroding the flesh.

Indeed, the venom in his right arm, enhanced by black magic, was eating away at Ludwig's flesh.

Grandmaster's Arms.

In exchange for it, Ludwig gained great power.

Christina wiped Ludwig's wet body with a medicated towel and began dressing his right arm.

The bandage itself is no ordinary object either.

It's a long, long magical scroll in its own right, not to mention specially medicated.

Created by Louis and realized by Anna, this long magical scroll controls Ludwig's rejection and prevents the black magic from escaping.

Aside from the cosmetic issues, the bandages also serve to protect Ludwig's body.

Anna looks at Ludwig with a pitying expression.

"Ludwig....... The rejection cycle is getting shorter and shorter."

"......There's a price to pay for cheating."

It's not hard-won power.

Ludwig laughed bitterly, "So you have to put up with the pain.

Ludwig was the only living human to fight in the Gethsanosian campaign.

Not a single person was killed in this battle.

That alone might have made him useful.

For that alone, I feel like I'm not a nobody.

We did something.

So even if you die in vain, you don't die for nothing.

Still, a little more.

While you're still in motion.

You can do something about it.

It feels like you're going to break, but you're not broken until you really are.

As it is, if we can end a war without anyone having to fight, I think we can call that a meaningful life to some extent.

There will come a time when rejection will push the envelope, but it hasn't come yet.

It's not hard to endure the pain.

Because pain is fleeting.

I'm just afraid of this body breaking.

Ludwig breathed raggedly, his eyes bloodshot with pain.



* * *



The Crusader Captain is a very bizarre position.

Even now, in its weakened state, it is one of the five most powerful forces in the Alliance, and one of the most important on the battlefield: the power to heal.

No other Allied faction can ignore the Crusaders.

There was no one to point out the crusader's disrespect.

And the rudeness was kind of nice.

If you try to find out, you'll get hurt.

You're hurt, very badly.

How in the world do you think they could have gotten a force equivalent to the Allied main body?

It's clear that it's a force to be reckoned with.

It's a powerful thing, and it's clear that you can't give it up easily.

What kind of nefarious means could be involved?

No amount of imagination can change the fact that you shouldn't know about it.

As the Crusader leader said, he should be grateful that the Emperor had kept it a secret until now.

You never know when you might be held jointly and severally liable.

That's when I realized the truth about covering my ears.

And another thing everyone has learned.

That the new crusader leader is a very unpleasant person.

And apart from that, she seems to know the truth.

"I'm offended that he's sitting there."

"What can I say, neither for me nor for Reinhardt."

After the meeting, in his barracks, Bertus smiled bitterly at a very unhappy-looking Saviolin Tana.

Bertus himself had nothing to say about it, but Saviolin Tana had every intention of slitting the new Crusader leader's throat at the first sign of an order.

If it weren't for Reinhardt's timely arrival, Rowen would have literally burned the ecliptic to ashes.

It was hard to bear to see such a man ascend to the position of Crusader Commander and look so nonchalant as if nothing had happened.

"It's enough that they moved the way I thought they should. It's hard to expect them to like your attitude."

In the end, it's enough to say that the Crusader leader's demeanor was in line with Bertus' intentions, and that he took control of the situation so that people would no longer question him.

And it's always better to have your opponent move your pieces the way you want them to than to have them move your pieces the way you want them to.

Rowen eventually spoke and moved as Bertus thought. Whether or not she spoke as he intended, it was within reason, within expectation.

The defeat of Gethsinothia by Immortals alone was bound to have a profound effect on the Alliance.

Faced with the choice of making noise instead of waging war without bleeding power, or saving the Immortals for a crucial moment, Bertus chose one.

"What was the breakage rate, by the way?"

"It was about 8 percent."

There can't be zero sacrifice, so Immortal had to lose power.

"That's a fun army, even if it's broken, I can just repair it and send it back to battle......."

You've converted a human into a golem, so it's not death, it's destruction.

Immortals are troops that can't die, but they can be repaired if they get damaged.

Until the time comes for a battle that requires a full army, continue to wage war with only emotes, if they are capable of doing so.

"Now it looks like we're really, really close."

Tana knows what's at stake.

But was that really the end of the gate crisis?

Saviolin Tana looked at the Emperor with a sad expression on her face.

"By the way, I noticed that the combat data is going to....... I wonder if that makes sense."

Only one human participated in the battle for Gethonia.

Except for that one person, the rest were all immortals.

Ludwig.

What happened to Ludwig, Bertus knew, of course.

Ludwig gained a level of power that ridiculously exceeded his original abilities.

"How is this possible with a single arm transplant?"

Bertus narrowed his eyes, scanning Ludwig's physical and combat data.

By the time Bertus tried to stop it, it was too late.

This was after Christina had performed the procedure on Ludwig.

"They told me that technically I didn't get an arm transplant, I got a black magic transplant."

His arm, already strong in life, has been enhanced with dark magic. A stronger, more robust magic circuitry has been implanted, and alchemy has imbued it with even more power.

It's not about getting an arm transplanted.

It's like being implanted with a giant piece of magic itself.

"......Is that possible?"

"They say it's not possible."

"......Yes, you made the impossible possible?"

"No, Your Majesty."

Saviolin Tana shook her head.

"I'm just trying to hold on to something that's not possible."

You've forced yourself to have something you shouldn't have.

Therefore, it is doomed.

But Ludwig's problem is ultimately a personal one.

It's not a choice anyone forced on you.

This is the path Ludwig chose for himself.

The real problem lies elsewhere.

The real problem with immortals.

Right now, Immortals are the Emperor's, but they can stop being the Emperor's at any time.

The true owners of the Immortals are the three wizards who created them.

The management of Immortals has also been removed from the hands of Imperial mages. They didn't need to, as all the groundwork was already laid.

Immortals are a force for war.

So, you don't need it after the war is over.

But the wielders of the Immortal are now thinking about its post-war uses.

How to do something about it.

It's important to note that while the three mages who led the research were trained by the Black Order, the experiments were eventually conducted by Imperial mages as well.

While it was impossible to wrest control of the Immortals, we now knew what would happen if we messed with the three wizards.

In front of Bertus's eyes is the analysis of the Imperial mages.

"It's intuitive and obvious, but that's what makes it harder."

It's a complicated read, but the important stuff isn't long.

Saviolin Tana's eyes widen at the Emperor's reaction.

"Is there any way to neutralize the immortals?"

It's unfortunate that we're at war, and instead of marveling at the usefulness of an incredibly efficient weapon of war, we have to figure out how to disable it first, but that's the most important thing right now.

"No, if you try to disable it, you're just going to make weirder things happen."

"For something even weirder......."

"It seems that once you kill Christina, the Immortal is set up to be a weapon of mass destruction from then on."

"Such......!"

Christina's safeguards.

If tampered with, the Immortal becomes a pseudo-unidentifiable killing machine.

Saviolin Tana gritted her teeth.

Whose idea is that, anyway?

"What the hell....... Why would you do that......."

"If you do that, you know you can't touch it, and maybe, just maybe, we've gotten this far on purpose."

"......."

It's not going to be for the purpose of slaughtering people.

"Cut the crap, and think about dying a gentle death after it's all over....... I can smell your intentions."

I'm doing this to save someone's life.

I'm doing this for the sake of peace.

In the past, neither the devil nor the emperor knew that doing this would cause a gate.

Hence the gate debacle.

She knows that's what happened to them.

Therefore, this time we show the correct answer.

Immortals are probably the biggest threat to you since the Gate.

It shouldn't be hard to kill one lowly alchemist trying to kill you with an immortal.

It's too easy, and you can do it right now.

But since we don't know what will happen if we kill Christina, we can't make that choice until after the Gate Crisis is over.

Now you know the answer.

If you kill Christina, a rampaging Immortal will take the monster's place and beat up the world.

Then you can't say you're doing it for the sake of something, even with the slightest hypocrisy.

When immortals run amok, the strongest will survive.

You can teleport, or run away to a faraway place where Immortals' attacks can't reach you.

In the end, only people who don't have that kind of power will die.

A group of people who say they've been doing this for something, but the option of killing an Immortal to survive is not an option in the first place.

The moment you make that choice, you may survive, but your entire raison d'etre and purpose is gone.

It's a malicious taunt and provocation.

If you care so much about the world and the weak, prove it.

Killing us is easy.

We're not running away anywhere.

Kill us, and you can live.

But do you get to choose?

Given that choice, she'd die laughing, mocking the hypocrisy of it all.

What if it's uneven?

It will be hunted by the Immortals as it was after the Gate debacle.

You're not being forced into a corner.

There's a way to go, and it's a very comfortable way to go, but it's a way to deny everything you've ever known.

But the moment you go down that path, you're negating everything you've done so far.

There are two paths she suggested

"In the end, it's all about Ease Sunda."

Die.

Only you will die.

Live.

Only you will live.
