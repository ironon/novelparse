            Episode 620.





After all the time we've been together, I still haven't gotten rid of Pektong's habitual hot flashes.

So that's a good thing, but.

Herriot dragged me to his lab in Razak, his face gaping.

Every time I see this place, I honestly feel bad.

The enormous research facility in the basement of the Temple College of Magic naturally came to mind.

We were able to use that facility and scale for a single project.

Herriot's laboratory wasn't particularly well-equipped, to say the least, and she'd built it herself whenever she needed it, or, if she didn't know better, with the advice of the Lord Vampires of the Senate.

I know it's silly to assume, but I can't help but feel sorry for her every time I see her.

You don't even have to go to Temple School of Magic.

The magical research facilities in Razak, frankly, don't hold a candle to the facilities of the Magical Research Society fraternity in the Temple. At least those were the labs of professorial wizards.

Our paktong.

It's like watching your daughter pull up her socks while you're trying to get your nose in the wrong place.

She's actually a princess.

When I see him trying to do something just by being there, I think that maybe our paktong is actually a person with a strong life force.

She has the greatest talent in the history of the world, and she can't even fulfill it because she's with a man who can't get behind her.

What to do.

I'm the biggest pain in the ass.

Other kids are making Titans, they're making armies called Immortals.

My child, who is nothing compared to them, and in some ways even more talented than them, is cowering in this attic lab because she met the wrong guy!

"I'm sorry."

"......Suddenly? What?"

"I'm just sorry for everything."

"What, off the cuff."

Harriet pouted her lips as if to say, "Don't go off on a tangent.

No complaints, which makes it all the more salty and I'm sorry.

"Anyway, so what."

Despite what I think, I've come to accept that it's in my nature to talk like this.

"Look at this."

Herriot pointed to a flat metal griddle.

It's got a lot of patterns on it, and it looks like a base for something, to be precise, and it's a little bit convex, so it looks like a machine.

And it's not one.

It was a pair of griddles.

"Pfft. I'm not a genius like you, I don't know what it is when I see it. You'll have to explain."

"If you're a dick, you're a dick, if you're a genius, you're a genius, can you just do one?"

Paxton, I'm not a genius like you.

Okay, that was a weird one.

"Uh-huh."

"...... for real!"

-Bam!

"You said do one!"

"Shut up!"

I did what I was told!

Anyway.

It's a never-ending cycle.

It's so much fun, I can't stop.

He knows this, and if he thinks I'm being a dick, he'll say what he has to say.

Herriot placed the pair of metal griddles at each end of the desk.

"Okay, make this look like this....... Hmm."

As Herriot fiddles with it, the thin sheet of steel begins to move and take shape.

A few metal plates protrude from what used to be a base, and it looks like a cradle for something.

It's like a three-legged table turned upside down.

Herriot did the same thing, this time on a different griddle.

Something that looks like a pair of cradles.

Herriot grabbed what looked like a metal rod from something lying around the lab.

This was also true for temples.

We're not very organized.

You say you don't need to know what's where.

"Look."

-chirp! chirp!

Soon, blue sparks began to fly from a pair of griddles.

"......isn't that dangerous?"

"It's not dangerous, though it's the first time I've actually done it."

"How do I know if it's dangerous or not without actually doing it!"

"My theory can't be wrong."

a.

I don't know what it is, but it's math or something?

The expression is correct, so there's no reason why implementing it in the real world would give a different result.

You've done all the in-brain simulations.

I can't, but you can.

"Then it won't be dangerous."

"......I don't know if you believe me or not."

-Pajik! Pajik! Chijijijiji!

Soon, sparks began to leap from the edges of a pair of griddle spikes, which soon began to glow blue.

Gradually, the blue color begins to take on the shape of a sphere.

A pair of blue spheres.

The inside of the blue sphere was colored black.

This.

No way.

"Here."

In the left one of the spheres, Herriot put something that looked like a crowbar.

And.

-Took

The rod shot out of the sphere on the right and landed on the desk. It rolled around and fell to the floor in a heap.

You don't know what this is.

"Hey....... This......."

"Yes."

Herriot laughs.

"A warp gate. A new warp gate, on a path unrelated to the gate incident."

My kid.

In this harsh and crude environment.

We hit another big one.

"Does this....... makes sense......?"

"I did it because it worked, idiot."

"You are....... You are......!"

-Wrong!

"Ouch, that hurt!"

"You are the best paktong ever!"

"What are you talking about!"



* * *



What is logistics and distribution.

To be honest, I still don't know the details.

I just know that it's very important.

And we know that the Golden Age of the Empire didn't come from the Demon Slaughter, but from the Warp Gate.

The golden age of humanity, and the golden age of empire.

It wasn't because people could come and go through the warp gate, it was because logistics could come and go beyond people.

The development of transportation and logistics leads to the rapid sophistication of society.

This is because rapidly developing logistics inherently allows for specialization.

Prior to the development of logistics, many cities would have to be self-sufficient, centered around a base city.

including food, commerce, and manufacturing.

To some extent, you have to be self-sufficient.

However, if logistics is extremely well distributed, a city that specializes in commerce or manufacturing may not need to produce food at all. Of course, they can import it, and that's what cities and countries with specialized agricultural environments do.

For example, suppose a city in a cold climate has a mine with a large amount of magic stones.

If the distribution is unreliable, the city has to be self-sufficient in food to a certain extent, even in cold climates, and in the end, it will be difficult for people to live, and it will inevitably be difficult to develop.

But what if you only have a warp gate?

Food will have to be imported from somewhere, and that's it, so it will be a mining city where you can mine magic stones in large quantities.

The logistically intensive Zodiacal Gradient became the Empire's largest city because it had the most warp gates.

People flock, goods flock, supplies flock.

So it was only natural that Gradient would be the largest city.

The food problem in the Zodiac Gradient is also a result of the fact that Zodiac was never an agricultural city in the first place.

Distribution is blocked, and a city that wasn't even self-sufficient is forced to feed itself.

So the empire is forced to farm and clear land in order to feed itself somehow, and to produce and supply food from secure lands elsewhere.

But without the overwhelming, always-on distribution simplification of a warp gate, everything has to be done by mass teleportation by the Archmages.

So first of all, there's a shortage of production, and if you're doing it outside of the ecliptic, you're going to have to have a super-skilled workforce of archmages just to move stuff around.

Since the Gate debacle, warp gates have become a completely obsolete technology.

The reason is simple.

It's because an imaginary dimension, a sort of virtual dimension, has become a real dimension, and the monsters of the Gate have taken over.

Of course, that doesn't mean you can't create a warp gate.

You can create one.

It's just a bunch of monsters spilling out of there.

"So, you created a second imaginary dimension?"

"Yes."

"I don't know, but the reason people haven't done it before isn't because they can't think of it, right?"

"Maybe not?"

This is the first time I've ever thought of this.

It makes me want to hug him fiercely and kiss him a hundred times.

"So it's because you're so awesome, right?"

You did what a bunch of farting kids couldn't do with the best facilities, and you did it with a header on the ground?

At my words, Harriet blanches and wiggles her fingers.

"......Well, I wouldn't say that."

"Exactly, no, exactly."

"Uh huh....... Right......."

You do realize what a great job you've done.

I'm watching him squirm with embarrassment after a major accident.

It looks a million times cuter and more awesome than usual.

"Let's cuddle, my paktong."

"Shh, no!"

"No why!"

"I don't like this, it's like praising a dog!"

"No, who cares?"

In the end, it was the same thing: I got what I deserved and I got what I didn't deserve.

What it was like to create a new imaginary dimension.

You may not realize it, but warp gates weren't invented by a single wizard in the first place.

From what I've heard from Archduke St. Thuan, it was a project that the Emperor pushed for long ago, almost at the cost of the empire.

The best wizards of the day would be attached to it, and it would be the result of the best wizards of the day working together for a very long time.

The Warp Gate is the culmination of many years of research and experimentation.

It's no one man's show, and she did it all by herself, here, with no facilities or equipment.

In the beginning, when I was still clueless as to the cause of the gate, Herriot had skimmed through the research on warp gates under the guise of studying dimensional magic.

This knowledge is already in Herriot's head, so it won't be exactly the same as it was before he developed the warp gate.

But at the end of the day, it doesn't change the fact that Herriot did something that no one else did.

Anyway, unlike the original, Heriot does fight, but that's not his purpose. She's not always on the battlefield.

So in the end, he had time to think and came up with his own, albeit crude, way to resurrect the warp gate technology.

Of course, I'm sure it's also due in large part to the fact that I made him do research on warp gates that he shouldn't have known about in the first place.

The truth in the end.

Herriot succeeded in devising a new warp gate system.

"What's the distance?"

"I'm just trying it out to see if it works or not, and if I make it bigger, of course the distance will increase, but it's not really serving any purpose right now."

"What if we can afford to go big?"

"It's not much different than an existing warp gate, and you know that warp gates work with all warp gates within their reach, right?"

"I know."

"Also, remember when I set up a network of interconnecting warp gates, a gated passageway that would allow us to reach our destination in one fell swoop without having to go back and forth?"

"A little bit."

The old warp gate system, or subway lines in layman's terms, were haphazardly built with too many transfers. It felt like spaghetti code.

It's kind of like the subway stations where the first subways were built were very dilapidated, even though you can't see the dilapidation.

But this is something that Herriot designed from scratch.

You don't have to get off and on at gate stops, then get back on, then get off, then get back on again to make a super long trip like you used to.

"I guess we're going to have to have a waypoint to travel super long distances after all, connecting gates to....... So we'll have to build a Nexus."

"Nexus......?"

"We need a connection point to amplify the warp gate signal, which is what the warp gate does, it's just a waypoint, it doesn't actually let people in and out."

"Did you develop that too, the bird?"

"...... No way, just make half a warp gate and that's a nexus."

"......?"

"You don't understand?"

"Of course."

Sir, I don't quite understand what you're saying.

Herriot draws a picture.

1 - 2 - 3

"Let's say it's a straight path."

"Yes, sir."

"......What do you mean?"

"No, explain."

"I mean, normally you'd have to build a whole warp gate to connect points 1, 2, and 3."

"Right."

"But now that the city is mostly destroyed, we don't need to build warp gates at every point, right? At points 1, 2, and 3, point 2 doesn't even have a city, but we want to connect points 1 and 3. But points 1 and 3 are too far apart, let's say."

"Uh."

"So point 2 doesn't have to be a fully completed warp gate, just a half-built one that acts as a waypoint, do you understand?"

"It's like a joke?"

"Yeah."

I can see what you mean now.

"With the current warp gate technology, you'd have to build a warp gate at point 2, but that's a waste of resources to build a warp gate at point 2 that's really only going to be used as a waypoint, so why not shorten that process and just have a structure there that can only perform certain functions of a warp gate, since there's no reason for people to actually go in and out of point 2. The nexus is just a name for convenience, and you can literally just build a little bit of a warp gate to act as a nexus. If you think you need to build a warp gate at point two later on, you can build it, but you can complete the nexus with a warp gate. It's basically the same structure."

Well.

I still can't quite understand it, but I know what it's saying.

What I'm saying is that you can set up a simplified station, just get it connected, and then complete it properly when you need to.

And.

Warp gates could reduce the cost of connecting entire continents astronomically. You're saying that the inefficiencies that have been there since the beginning of time have been eliminated, and now you have a completely streamlined operation.

Herriot smiles at me, half-understanding after all this time.

"Do you know why I told you this long story?"

"How do I compliment you?"

"......How the hell do you see me?"

Her eyes widen as she realizes I'm not saying this to get a compliment.

"It's not impossible to warp gate between the continent and Edina, and beyond that to the empire and Edina, and we can do it for a lot less money than we used to."

I couldn't help but roll my eyes at that.

Connect the Empire and Edina to each other with a warp gate.

That's downright dangerous.

The Empire still doesn't know where we are, so we're safe.

But it's not like Herriot is saying this because he wants to destroy Edina.

"Anti-Imperial forces in the ecliptic, we can bring them straight to Edina, and no one will have to see blood."

"......."

"You're thinking, 'If something happens, I'm going to have to lead all those people out of the ecliptic,' and you know that's impossible."

The seeds of division have already been planted, germinated, and are growing.

The moment that becomes visible at some point, a huge number of people are going to die.

You have a choice to bring down the empire.

And another option.

With my followers, I left the ecliptic and traveled far and wide southward toward Edina.

A war, or a campaign.

In both cases, it was clear that a huge number of people would be killed.

It is foolish to drive people into a death spiral to avoid war.

But just because it's stupid, is it wise to start a civil war on the gradient the moment this divide becomes visible?

I didn't choose what to do.

I was just thinking I might have to do it.

It's clear that connecting the Empire and Edina with a warp gate is a risky proposition.

But if it can tear tens of millions of people apart without a fight.

At least it's better than a campaign.

"I'm not saying you have to do that."

"......."

"But we just need to know that we've got one new possibility, and one much-needed tool to rebuild the world, even if not necessarily in this way."

Warp gates can be a technology for war, or a technology for prosperity and rebuilding, depending on how they are used.

"And we're focusing on connecting the archipelago first. Shorter travel times between the islands will allow for greater cohesion, as well as greater control of the central administration. You realize there's a reason why the imperial power has been so absolute since the development of the Warp Gate, right?"

The first step is to reconnect the Edina Archipelago to the warp gate.

Here's what happens next

I can't believe that such a world-changing technology came from a tiny, cute little head.

"I'll grant you a wish. What is it?"

I'd give anything to be in this mood right now!

You can bite your tongue and die!

What do you want!

I've got you covered!

"You're so serious, you shouldn't be....... Yeah......."

"No, not one. I'll do anything for you, ever. Just say the word! Anything! Just! Just! Uh! I'll do anything! Just!"

"It's too much!"

Herriot, who hadn't expected such a strong reaction from me, thought for a moment and then sighed.

"That's it, give me a cat."

No.

Ya.

Suddenly?

"Not again, you did that last time......!"

She's just as much a case of severe cat syndrome as Ellen.

He wants me to do it every chance I get!

And that's it?

"No?"

They look at me like I'm going to do anything for them, and then they look at me like I can't even do that.

Uh.

If that's the price you pay for creating a new warp gate.......

I wonder if it's too cheap, but.......

"You're going to do it, right?"

"......Naturally."

Eventually, that night.

I had to fall asleep while being violently hugged by Paxton in cat form.

Honestly, it's not a loss, it's just good for me......?

I want to.
