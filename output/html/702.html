            Episode 702.





Empress Herriot was walking through the Imperial Palace after leaving the Palace of Spring with Priscilla.

Sure, Priscilla's polarizing, but the root cause is Amelia's relentless bullying from a very young age.

"It's weird in the first place, if you hate your mom and me so much, why don't you just go live with your mom in the Temple dorms or in the Holy Empire?"

In the words of Priscilla.

It's Amelia's choice to stay at the Palace of Spring, despite always saying she doesn't like the way she looks.

If you don't want to be seen, there are plenty of ways to stay out of sight.

Therefore, the Princess can only assume that Amelia is staying at the Palace of Spring to torment her, nothing more, nothing less.

As his daughter grumbles, Akmeiji stares off into the distance.

"Priscilla."

"Why."

"When Rune first came, do you remember?"

"......Yes."

Empress Rune is the daughter of an Archmage, but is actually an illegitimate child taken in by the Emperor.

But Akmeiji accepted the rune without question or debate.

At the time, Priscilla was seven years old.

"I'm glad Priscilla thinks Rune is cute, but didn't you ever feel sorry for him?"

"......."

While Priscilla was surprised by her sudden sibling, she was also very affectionate from the start.

Because it was too adorable to hate.

But I don't know that I've ever been truly sorry.

Seeing her mother always following Lun, taking care of him, watching over him, taking care of him.

Can you really say you've never felt like something was off?

"......I think it was a little bit."

"How?"

Priscilla stares up at her mother.

Something you don't want to admit, but can't help but recognize.

Something like sorrow.

"Something....... mom, like she was taken away from me."

"I see."

Empress Herriot smiles faintly and gently strokes her daughter's hair.

"But thanks for putting up with me so far."

Priscilla blushes at the sudden compliment.

"......But what does that have to do with Amelia?"

She's jealous of Rune and wonders what the horse has to do with Amelia. Priscilla pouts, and Harriet kneels down carefully to be eye level with her.

"You know, His Holiness. When I had Amelia, I was so busy and had so much to do, I couldn't raise her."

"......."

"So my mom raised her for a while."

Only then did Priscilla's eyes widen as she realized what her mother was talking about.

With the rise of the Holy Empire, Olivia had a lot on her plate.

Not only did she feel threatened for her life, but she was unable to raise her child properly.

That's why Herriot raised Amelia in the safest palace in the Holy Empire, not in the Great Hall.

"So Amelia actually has two moms, the Holy Father and this one."

"......."

"When Amelia turned three, she had you."

Herriot strokes Priscilla's cheek sadly.

"And after she gave birth to you....... the Holy Father was free and took Amelia to the Holy Empire."

Priscilla felt a pit in her stomach as she saw her mother look very sad, as if she was thinking about that time.

"It's not Priscilla's fault, but Amelia is....... I'm sure she felt like Priscilla took her mom away from her."

Olivia wanted to be with the daughter she couldn't raise in her arms.

Herriot hasn't been able to take Priscilla out of her arms since she gave birth.

But for Amelia, she is suddenly separated from the mother who raised her.

So Priscilla has been robbed of her mother, or so she thinks.

Amelia had been bullying Priscilla for as long as she could remember.

It's not her fault, but you can't help but resent her.

She was young, and she's still young enough.

I can't let go of that resentment.

"Then why do you call your mom a witch?"

"It's not because you hate me, it's because you love....... because I love it so much."

Because if you do, they'll look at you.

Because you care.

For the first time in her life, Princilla understood why Amelia had been crying herself to sleep in the arms of her mother, whom she pretended to hate so much.

"So the things Amelia says about her mom, don't read too much into it. Amelia doesn't hate her mom."

Eventually, we learn why Amelia is staying at the Palace of Spring.

I can't help but wonder why he doesn't live in the Holy Empire, or why he stays in the Palace of Spring instead of the Temple Dormitories.

You don't want to fall off.

"I don't know, even if I wanted to be nice, you're the first one, so I don't know what to do."

"......."

Knowing why you hate something doesn't mean you can fix it.

As such, Herriot could only smile sadly.

"And then there's my mom, who fights every time she sees you."

Herriot's face contorted grotesquely at Princilla's pointed remark.

In practice.

Even if you respect each other when you're not together, you're still going to get into a fight.

They don't go as far as Amelia and Priscilla, but they inherit the same relationships.

"That, that....... Is that......."

"You can't even get along with your mom, and you're telling us to get along?"

"Uh, I'll try to get along with my mom, and I'll try to get along with ......, and I want to get along with you, but you always come off like that!"

"That's what I just said, but you said to be nice."

"yi......."

"How are you going to get along with Shenghu, does your mom know?"

Harriet's face turns bright red and she begins to shake.

"You're so much like my dad, you don't say a word!"

"What!"

Eventually, my mother, like my daughter, exploded with a bang.



* * *



Same time.

Empress Olivia took her daughter and sat side by side in the palace garden in the springtime.

"How are you doing, are you okay?"

"It's ......."

Amelia sits at her mother's side, fidgeting. Olivia stares at her daughter, unable to keep still.

"Still fighting?"

It should be obvious who we're talking about.

"That's....... He first......."

"...... is it?"

"......."

Sung-hoo asks her if she knows what she's doing, and Amelia hangs her head in shame.

"Why do you hate Priscilla so much?"

"......."

Amelia can't answer.

But you already know that without me telling you.

Why I hate it so much.

But he can't blame her because he knows it's his fault he wasn't there when she needed him the most.

In fact, back in the Holy Empire, Amelia cried every day.

I want to see my mom.

Take me to my mom.

So, reluctantly, the Emperor took Amelia to visit the Palace of Spring from time to time.

And that's exactly what happens.

I don't want to go back to the Holy Empire.

Empress Herriot, cradling her infant daughter, is at a loss for words, and Olivia is devastated.

After so many unwanted separations, Amelia came to believe that Priscilla was the cause of everything.

I'm beginning to believe that if it weren't for Priscilla, none of this would have happened.

"She's part of your family, you can't treat her badly, but you can't bully her either."

"...... He's not my family."

"......."

"He's like my father, why is he my family?"

"Yeah. I see that's what you think......."

Olivia laughs bitterly at Amelia's comment.

I don't even consider them family.

No, you're envious of Priscilla.

Because Princilla is the Archmage's real daughter.

That's what I envy.

"Is it because I'm not your real daughter, so now that you have a real daughter, you don't like me?

'That's not it, Amelia....... It's not....... I'm sorry. I'm sorry....... But if you do this....... If I do this....... the Holy Father will be sad....... Amelia.......'

Olivia had seen her crying in Harriet's arms, and Olivia had seen her from a distance.

Olivia could only watch from a distance as Harriet freaked out.

And still.

Amelia doesn't call Olivia her mother.

As if that wasn't bad enough.

When you finally get the words out, you realize you're awkward, and your face contorts.

There was a gap that Olivia couldn't fill because she was spending so much important time away.

So even though she's a daughter, she's hard on herself, and Olivia is hard on her.

I didn't mean for this to happen, but it did.

So when my daughter said she wanted to go to the temple and live in the zodiac in the future, I reluctantly agreed.

You know you don't really want to go to the temple, you really want to stay at the Palace of Spring.

But now that she knows what happened, Amelia feels sorry and guilty for Olivia.

That's why I freeze like this when Olivia comes to visit.

They feel nothing but guilt and remorse for each other.

Olivia didn't really scold or criticize Amelia.

Olivia looks at her daughter's stony face, then smiles sadly.

"Actually, even if you had stayed with me in the Holy Empire the whole time, I don't think you'd be any better off than you are now."

"Is that ......?"

"Just, yeah."

Olivia stays still and looks up at the sky.

Due to circumstances, Olivia was forced to leave her daughter in the care of Harriet.

But I wonder if everything would have been fine if I hadn't.

Olivia still thought about it from time to time, but now it was more of a negative.

"You do realize that the Archmage is a former Grand Duchess of the Duchy of Saint-Tuan, right?"

"Ah....... Yes. I heard you come from a famous noble family......."

"And about your mother's origin?"

"......."

Amelia was unable to answer her mother's question.

It's not that I don't know.

I couldn't bring myself to say it.

"You know, my mom was an orphan."

"......."

"I was adopted by my stepfather at a young age, but he wasn't a very good person, someone who wanted to use me to do something great. I always had to live up to his expectations. I always had to be good, kind, and outstanding."

"......."

"It was like....... I felt like I was being forced to live for no reason."

Amelia doesn't know why her mother is telling her this.

"So I don't really know what a warm family is, or what a parent should do for their child."

Olivia laughs, almost childishly.

"So there's no guarantee that if you had a childhood with me, it would have been a good one. If anything, I might have been mean to you, or I might not have done what I should have done. You might have ended up hating me even more than you do now."

"I, I....... Holy Father....... I don't hate......."

"Yeah? Well, that's nice, I guess that's the best I can do for being separated?"

Uh-huh.

while doing it. Olivia smiles wryly.

Amelia is mesmerized by the look on his face.

The most difficult person in the world.

Amelia often thought that the most beautiful person in the world was her mother.

"But unlike me, who was an orphan, the Archmage was the youngest daughter of a great, great noble family."

"Good father, kind mother."

"And she had three brothers who thought she was beautiful."

"So you used to be a very bratty, cheeky, arrogant kid......."

"Well, he does know, after all."

"What makes a good parent."

"I know how a good parent acts, I know what a good mother is."

"I didn't know what it was, so I studied and researched and researched, and I ended up being clueless, and he knows."

"So she was a much better mom than I was, and Archmage was a much better mom than I was."

"That's why you've been crying for days and days about wanting to go back."

Amelia's eyes finally fill with tears at Olivia's sad words.

"Sorry......."

I know my mom didn't do anything wrong.

So, when you look back at what you've said and done, you can't help but feel guilty.

"No. That's because the Archmage cared for you and loved you, and if I was grateful, why would I blame you or him?"

"Would you have been the only one crying?"

"She cried a lot, too."

"The way she cried made me feel like I was stealing someone else's daughter."

"After all, the......."

"You mean, he loved you like his own daughter."

"He's very grateful."

"You've been so sweet to me, my daughter treats her real mom worse than anyone else, huh?"

Amelia's playfulness eventually leads to tears streaming down her face.

If I had raised it from scratch.

I've had that thought many times, but now it's ridiculous.

If I had raised him myself, not knowing what a good parent is, it would have been worse.

I've gotten to the point where I think so.

"I'm sorry, I was....... I was wrong......."

Amelia starts to cry because she realizes she's hurting her mother the most in the end, and Olivia just stares at her.

At the point where you're apologizing, you already know what's wrong.

That's enough, Olivia knows.

Speaking of someone's tears.

Than you cried.

Than the Archmage cried.

I cried more.

I don't say I cried alone where no one could see me.

Because that's not going to make anyone happy.

"I'm not judging you, Amelia."

"......."

"I don't want to say I'm sorry, and it's not like I've done anything wrong."

Olivia looks up at the sky.

"Are you thanking the Archmage?"

"......."

"You should be grateful."

"Thanks and....... have......."

You can call her names, even call her a witch, but she can't do anything about it except give you an embarrassed, sad smile.

On days when Amelia would have a meltdown, Priscilla would come over in the middle of the night without her knowing and stroke her head until she fell asleep.

Still not enough.

I'm still sad.

Amelia, who is always grumpy and even spoils her own daughter, has never truly reprimanded or criticized her.

I know I should be grateful for that alone.

It just doesn't translate into action and words.

"Akmeiji was so kind to you, even though you weren't his biological daughter, wasn't he?"

"It's ......."

"If you're right, that's why he loved you, not his family."

If Priscilla is not a family member because they share the same father, then of course Harriet is not a family member of Amelia.

It's not even really a mother.

And yet I loved her like a daughter.

"Of course, Amelia."

"......."

"You must give back to Priscilla the love you received."

Because it was loved.

Don't try to return that love to the Archmage, but rather love the Archmage's daughter like a real sister.

"Then he'll love you even more than he does now."

"......."

Then they'll love you more.

They'll be grateful and happy, not grudgingly smiling with a sad face like they always do. They'll smile because they're really happy, and they'll love you even more for it.

But in the end, you're saying something sad to yourself, and she's saying it in her own words.

Olivia hides her feelings, smiling mischievously and stroking her daughter's hair.

"I'm not asking you to love your mom, but if you want to be loved by your fake mom, I'm asking you to do that, and you're going to say no?"

Amelia steals a glance at Olivia, who asks her the same question over and over again.

I'm not forcing you to love me.

That if you want to be loved by someone who thinks you're a mom, you have to do it.

After all, she knows.

Even if they don't spend a lot of time together, she knows that her mother loves her very much.

"Sorry....... I'm sorry....... I'll do that......."

Therefore, Amelia has to force her mouth to move to speak.

"Uh, mom....... I'll do as you say."

At that, Olivia beams with satisfaction.

"Okay, this is my daughter."

"......."

Olivia gently pulls Amelia into a hug.

"By the way."

"You know what?"

"Because if you don't kill it now, it might crawl up your ass later."

"Just like who."

"So, don't be too loose."

"Because she's my sister."

"You have to treat her like a big sister, okay?"

Amelia couldn't help but blush at his smirk.

"Yes......?"

"Be nice, but if she's mean, beat her. Up and down, be sure."

I couldn't tell if he was asking me to hit him or not.

"Got it?"

"Oh, yeah......."

I know I'm a bit of a weirdo myself.

My mother seems like a really weird person.

Amelia couldn't help but think so.
