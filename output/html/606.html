            Episode 606.





No one would bring up the name Reinhardt in Ellen's presence, even if they were talking about demons.

Because everyone knows that's Ellen's backstory.

Just now, she crossed a taboo.

If it were Reinhardt and not Ashur who died, would you not try to bring him back, as I did?

From the look on his face as he said it.

I could tell from the look in her eyes that she already hated Ellen.

Nothing is hidden anymore in this horrible laboratory.

Malice.

Hate.

Hate.

Everything you've been hiding is revealed.

"What's that, and why?"

The corner of Christina's mouth twitches at Ellen's comment.

"You and Reinhardt had a special relationship."

"......."

"That's what I'm thinking right now. Isn't that right?"

Ellen's eyes widened, and everyone held their breath.

Everyone in Royal Class knows that it pains Ellen to even hear the name, much less to be told that she'll have to fight the Devil someday.

No one brought it up in front of Ellen and directly provoked her.

It was the first time she'd ever said that directly.

Things that had been hanging on by a thread were falling apart.

In a disgusting, horrifying, and terrifying sight.

The boundaries of truth that we've been pretending not to know collapse.

"Christina, calm down."

A lesser Bertus approached Christina, but she shook her head.

"Me, I just heard about that the other day."

Christina grits her teeth and glares at Ellen.

"All of this because of just a few people."

"......."

"Surely, it wasn't the devil."

"......."

"Do you have anything to say about that?"

Christina glares at Ellen as if demanding an answer.

Someone you already know.

But there are still people who don't know.

What she doesn't realize is that she has to lie to them.

"No ......."

"Really?"

There is someone in this room who doesn't know the truth.

We don't know how she got there or what she was told.

Ellen was pretty sure she didn't want more people to know the story.

"You're so shameless......."

"Enough."

Christina tries to lunge, but Bertus, who has seen better, gets between them.

"Ellen, I'm sure you've seen what you want to see, so why don't you go home first."

"......."

Ellen simply kept her mouth shut.

"Lord Tana, please fetch Ellen."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

Everyone was confused by the sudden nervousness and unintelligible conversations.

"Christina, I need to talk to you for a minute."

At Bertus's seemingly murderous words, Christina smiled and nodded.

"Good."

Rather, they seemed to be waiting for the words to come out.



* * *



Ellen was led out of the College of Magic by the hand of Savior Tana.

So far, the only people Ellen has been able to talk to about Reinhardt have been people who at least know the truth.

It was just Charlotte, or Bertus, or Tana the Violin.

But we didn't bring it up because it was painful for us to even talk about it.

But today, out of the blue, Christina's name came up in conversation.

And he gave off the nuance of knowing about everything.

Bertus wouldn't tell her the truth if he didn't want her to know it. So how did Christina find out about it?

If Christina knows, do Louis Ankton and Anna know the truth?

And whether being silent was the right choice.

It didn't take long to realize that Louise von Schwarz had a straight heart.

But learning the truth about the Gate situation is another matter entirely.

It's not just hypocrisy to cover one's own sins, it's an issue that, if misrepresented, could divide the entire human race.

Therefore, I felt it was the right decision to remain silent.

An unknown, dark emotion welled up inside me, but I knew it would be a mistake to respond to Christina's words.

They were trying to raise the dead, and they were using the dead.

That would be a sin.

But without the Gate debacle, there would have been no sin.

If so, you've committed the greatest sin of all: you are the cause of all sin.

Who are we to say something is bad, and who are we to say someone is wrong for doing something wrong?

It's no wonder she's suddenly having such a reaction.

To Christina, who is probably thinking that if it weren't for you, Ashar wouldn't be dead.

Ashur is dead, he can't be brought back, stop it.

Hearing that would have made me furious.

But that's not what I meant.

He didn't mean sin no more.

The implication was that it was bothering you, it was destroying you, and you shouldn't do it.

I didn't say it to reprimand her, I said it because I didn't want her to get hurt anymore.

But I know she couldn't help but get angry when she heard it.

Ellen gritted her teeth and was forced to follow Tana back to her dorm.

I didn't know what I needed to know, and I didn't know what I shouldn't have known.



* * *



Ellen was led out of the lab by Savior Tana.

Bertus said something that sounded like he knew, and then he went off somewhere to talk to Christina.

So even in the lab, in the quarantined area, there were only Ludwig, Heinrich, and Louise. And Louis and Anna remained.

Break room in a quarantine lab.

The five sat in uncomfortable silence, unable to speak.

No one had anything to say about it.

Or those who have seen something they didn't want anyone to see.

They saw something they shouldn't have, and for their own reasons, they were too afraid to say anything.

But Louise is the one who's in the deepest trouble.

She was helping because she realized that pursuing Rowen's death could be dangerous for Ellen.

Rowen's death had nothing to do with the Empire, according to the Emperor, but he had learned a secret of the Empire that he was not supposed to know.

Louise's confusion goes beyond the shock and horror she feels at this sight.

The fact that he was able to 'see' it.

Louise couldn't understand it now.

Though nominally an empire, the Schwarzes have always wanted to surpass the Empire.

Louise knows that the royal family has had such aspirations for generations, and she knows that the Empire knows about them, and she knows that the Empire has kept the Schwarzes in check for many years.

Now is the time to confront the crisis of humanity, and I have no intention of publicizing the injustice and corruption of the Empire as I have done in the past.

But when all is said and done, it's the weakness of the empire.

Of course, the emperor may have been so confident in the military power he was gaining from this that he allowed Ruiz to watch.

But do we really need to show this weakness?

It would have been better not to show it.

The Emperor did not seem to feel any discomfort about Louise seeing this.

It's weird that you were able to get into the temple in the first place.

If he were the emperor, he would not have allowed Louise to enter the temple in the first place. He would have had plenty of reasons to deny her access.

"Is it okay for me to see this?

We don't know the emperor's intentions.

And what Christina just said.

I couldn't figure out what she meant by her accusatory remarks.

I couldn't help but think of Heinrich's words to the devil.

There's something people don't realize about the Gate debacle.

The devil didn't want Gate to happen either.

It is inevitable that the Emperor, Ellen, and Christina know about the truth.

As confused as Louise was, everyone else was feeling their own confusion.

"If Christina's right, can we save Ashur from....... alive?"

Ludwig's cautious question was directed at the silent Anna and Louis.

"......."

"......."

Their silence and facial expressions spoke volumes. Christina is trying to do the impossible.

"It involves black magic. Magic that uses unholy mana as its source....... It cannot be a power for the living......."

Anna added cautiously.

"Stronger than when they were alive, we can restore them that way, but....... I'll never be able to make you truly alive......."

Anna, whose understanding of the dark arts is no match for Christina's, already knew that Christina would not be able to reach the ending she wanted.

Knowing that, no one can say they shouldn't have stopped her. I don't need to tell you that, because it's clear enough that they were trying to stop her.

"Stronger...... than when you were alive?"

At Ludwig's questioning look, Louis nodded. Through clenched teeth, Louis Ankton opens his mouth with the expression of a bowed headed sinner.

"...... may look alive, but it's not."

"Just like the golem, just like the titan....... There's no difference."

"It's a reconstruction of a point in time when you were physically complete. You're not actually alive, so....... that you can extend a little further."

Heinrich asks as Louis speaks.

"Extend......?"

"You do realize that if you enchant before the enchantment circuitry is fully in place, the body can't handle the load and breaks down."

"I don't know if it should be me, but......."

Heinrich says, and looks at Ludwig.

"Yes. It's incredibly....... painful."

Ludwig remembered the pain vividly, as he spent several days in bed after awakening to his enchantment.

"Because pain doesn't matter to the dead."

"ah......."

The subjects feel no pain.

So beyond restoring your physical body, you can strengthen the elements necessary to manifest your power, including your magic circuits.

You will be able to transcend the limits of your body, the limits of your life.

In other words, it's a transmutation. You'll be able to wield a level of power in death that you weren't able to wield in life.

It can grant you powers that the living would not be able to withstand. It's a harsh statement, but in the end, it's not much different than dealing with objects. It's about making a weapon that only needs to be powerful more powerful.

They're not dead, they're just stronger.

Such an army was being formed.

"Do we really need a corpse?"

Hearing alone is great magic, beyond perfection, except that it involves a corpse.

Perfect, except for the moral issue of using a corpse.

"I mean, we could do that, like building a homunculus, but....... Right now, that's not the way......."

"You mean you can't power up in a short period of time."

"Yes......."

The homunculus experiment itself was a classic taboo, so I'm not saying it's without moral issues.

There are countless people who would sell their souls to the devil to save the world if they could, in order to get through their miserable days.

So maybe it's inevitable.

There are those who have sold their souls to the devil.

And when he sees that they have sold their souls to the devil, he is silent.

The Emperor said he had no intention of stopping it, and Louise knew she couldn't let him.

The emperor knows he can't stop this with his eyes, so he doesn't think it's a problem for him to watch.

I still didn't know the answer.

While those uncomfortable and sinful questions were being asked.

"Dying makes you stronger......."

Ludwig stares down at the table, muttering to himself.

Anna, Heinrich, and Louise could not help but shudder at the suddenness of his words.

"Don't think about it."

Heinrich said to Ludwig, frowning.

Everyone knows that Ludwig still wants to fight.

So Ludwig's words were bound to spark everyone's ominous imagination.

Raising the dead.

Even better, you'll be stronger than before.

Ludwig mumbles to himself.

"Right now, I'm useless."

It was no secret that Ludwig was beating himself up beyond belief.

"There was nothing I could have done. The people who killed the priest, even though they were never caught....... I had no part in it coming to this. Stupid, there was something I could do, and I was content with that."

Rowen is dead. And we still haven't caught the killer.

But Ludwig hasn't done anything to get this far; he's just followed Ellen around.

In the first place, Rowen was not the good guy Ludwig thought he was, but a man who captured, killed, and tortured civilians.

I was being used by Rowen and didn't even realize I was being used.

There were definitely some weird moments, but I didn't doubt it.

I just knew I was doing something to help make the world a better place.

Eventually, I saw something, even if it wasn't related to Rowen's death.

Magic to bring the dead back to life. Magic that makes you stronger than you were in life.

This shouldn't exist in the world.

But Ludwig can't help but realize that this is necessary, that it will end the war faster.

Useless.

But Ludwig laughs bitterly as he says it.

"It's okay. I don't want that. I don't want to fight to the death. I don't want to make that choice. I know that no one....... I know it won't make anyone happy, just....... because I feel helpless......."

That's what he says, but we all know he'd rather have it that way.

There are those who will grieve and despair when you die. You've already seen Christina.

I don't want to go out as a corpse because I want to be useful to someone, or because I want to go back into battle.

As long as there are people who care about him, Ludwig doesn't want that.

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief as Ludwig, who had made everyone's day, briefly, a little worse for wear.

"......says something weird."

"Sorry......."

Heinrich even considered that Ludwig might suddenly be found somewhere, having taken his own life.

And if Ludwig does, it's up to Anna, Louis, and Christina to bring him back to life.

Trying to bring them back for real, like you did with Ashur, may end up breaking your friends even more.

Ludwig had no intention of doing or asking for such a crazy thing. It was just a possibility that popped into his head.

But even if Ludwig said he had no intention of doing so, he couldn't help but feel as uneasy as Heinrich did.

An almost obsessive need to be helpful to others.

I was beginning to realize that I had a twisted mind, one that didn't always look good.

Heinrich was a straight-A student.

Anna and Louis, seeing Ludwig up close, were even more terrified.

Ludwig is a nice guy, and he cares about others, but he can also be a jerk, literally.

He doesn't say he'd fight to the death right now, but there's no telling how Ludwig's thoughts might change in the future.

And we're all on the same page when it comes to not wanting to lose any more friends.

Louis Ankton stares at Ludwig for a moment.

"......Ludwig."

"No, I really don't think about that, and don't worry about it......."

"I want to show you something."

Looking at Louis, who had a determined look on his face, Anna nodded, knowing what she was talking about.

"What do you mean you want to show me?"

Ludwig couldn't believe what he was about to witness.

"This is where we....... to bring Ashur back to life."

It's the deep end of the underground lab.

Louis led off by saying that the three of them are doing something different than other researchers, and that something different doesn't necessarily involve bringing people back to life.
