The unspoken gesture she made to the sky upon entering the village, manipulating the passage of time.

Was I actually dreaming?

Did I really go to Rizaira?

But it seemed clear to me that I wasn't dreaming, that I was entering and exiting a world called Lizaira.

"Ha, ha, ha......."

I couldn't help but wonder why she hadn't told me about this.

It might spread if it knew it wasn't timeless.

If we knew time wasn't passing, we'd be too easily lulled into a false sense of security.

So, in order to stir up my anxiety and nervousness, but also to get over it myself, I said nothing.

I hadn't been away from Edina long enough for two seasons.

I left Edina, not even a month ago.

I came back to this world after living in another world, in another time, not here.

-Whoooooooooo!

In the harsh winds, I look down at the view of the Sren Mountains.

I didn't teach you anything.

I've given you nothing.

What I need most right now.

And the most lacking.

Time.

It's a lot of time, and it's hard not to get something out of it.

"Whoa......."

It wasn't a tear, but moisture pooled in the corners of my parched eyes and I stole it roughly.

If I knew that time wasn't passing, I could actually be carefree, but I chose not to think about that kind of thing.

Luna gave me what I needed most, and I ended up getting what I wanted.

There's no telling how far you can go with this power.

However.

The actual time wasn't that long, but it was a long time away.

I, now, need to get back to where I need to be.

"To be honest, I don't think you did anything wrong, um....... Part of me wants to pat you on the ass for doing a good job?"

"......."

At Olivia's words, Liana de Granz stared at Olivia with a stony expression, but said nothing.

Olivia Ranze was not in her normal clothes, but in her usual priestly robes.

In fact, since Olivia rarely wears casual clothes anymore, it became her go-to outfit.

When Liana de Granz told her that Port Mokna had been self-selecting and killing evacuees all this time, Olivia's reaction was that it had to be done.

"I personally don't like it, but I don't understand the Regent's judgment either, because at the end of the day, you lied to Reinhardt, and he would never approve of it if he knew about it, so even if it was unavoidable, a result is a result."

"......."

"Anyway, I personally support your decision, but this is our job, and it's gotten too big to do something based on personal judgment alone, right?"

"It's ......."

"You have deceived Reinhardt thus far, and consequently you have deceived me."

Most of Fort Mokna's troops are either mages of the Vampire Council or priests and paladins of the Holy Order.

They were overly loyal to Lyanna at Port Mokna in the Cult, and deceived Olivia Ranze.

Olivia was effectively betrayed by the paladins and priests of the Holy Order.

"For a guy like you, who's not naturally gifted in politics or anything, to win the hearts and minds of everyone in Fort Mokna, and to do all this, and to keep the word from leaking out....... It's a miracle."

Riana doesn't have the words to win anyone over, and she doesn't like to do it.

It was Riana's charisma that allowed her to win the hearts and minds of all of them as the commander of Fort Mokna.

"Aside from any other personal feelings or feelings of betrayal, I can be on your side."

Olivia taps her fingers on the table.

"I mean, if only there weren't this 'weird side effect' thing......."

Olivia has come to Port Mokna not to pursue Riana, nor to punish the paladins and priests of the Holy Order for failing to report what they are supposed to report.

A pit in the outskirts of Fort Mokna.

He's here to solve the mysterious signs Lucinil has discovered.

Even in an environment with enough priests and paladins, no one noticed the signs.

Only Lucinil, who is spiritually sensitive enough, was able to recognize the strange signs before they materialized into ominous phenomena.

That's why Olivia Ranze has come here to exorcize and purify.

Riana didn't realize that her carnage would lead to this.

She knew something was going on, but she didn't know what kind of disaster it was going to cause, and she was kicking herself for it.

It doesn't just fall into predictable categories.

It's just the way of the world that things pop up in the most unexpected places.

But Riana's enemies are living, tangible beings.

Since we don't know how to deal with ghosts and spirits, Olivia Ranze must take responsibility for what Riana has done.

"The Regent said we might as well not risk it and abandon Port Mokna......."

We don't know what ominous implications this risk might have, so we might as well stay out of it. That was Charlotte's suggestion.

"Because my rule of thumb is that things like this can get out of control and become more dangerous."

Not knowing what's going to happen means that even if you leave the area, some unknown ash will still hit Edina.

With this level of risk, Olivia Ranze decided it was better to be proactive than to ignore it.

After all, Olivia doesn't know what threats Reinhardt might face, so she's here to take the risk herself.

In trying to save Reinhardt from a threat, you created another threat to Reinhardt.

"I'm sorry, sister."

Olivia smirked at Riana's comment.

"Do you even know how to say that?"

"Can you help me with this situation....... to resolve this situation?"

"Well......."

Olivia twists her hair and purses her lips.

"Maybe one or two, but who in the world knows what happens when the units are different?"

Unprecedented things happen with unprecedented consequences. Just as Lucinil couldn't predict what would happen, Olivia doesn't know what will happen.

And whether it's something you can really cleanse or fight.

I don't know.

Reading Olivia's playful, yet secretive demeanor, Riana looks at her with a stern expression.

"Don't hurt yourself, sister."

"That's funny. You must have hated me pretty much."

Olivia giggles.

"Is it because someone we both dislike showed up?"

It's none other than Charlotte.

"But people are supposed to get to know you after the fact."

Riana was speechless at the malicious joke.

"Gotta go. Get back to work."

"It's ......."

Olivia got up as if she was going for a walk.



* * *



Exiting the Fort Mokna command center, Olivia watched a group of paladins and priests line up outside.

They were all under Olivia's wing, but it had been a while since Riana had been delegated command.

They are the ones who deceived Olivia by remaining silent and not telling her the secrets she needed to know.

They were on edge, expecting wrath to fall.

Feelings of betrayal.

I can't say that there is no such thing.

But I agree with Riana that she made that decision, and I understand why she kept it quiet.

Now I'm on my way to deal with the side effects of what happened.

"Self....... from now on?"

Olivia smirks, as if she's not interested in judgment for those who betrayed her trust.

"I'm going to clean up your shit."

Olivia Ranze is known for her low-key demeanor, except when she's preaching.



* * *



A rural area quite a distance from Port Mokna.

Olivia made her way to the scene, escorted by a fairly large group of paladins and priests.

Olivia has nothing to do with this, but many of the priests and paladins who head out into the field are directly involved.

There were those who categorized and weeded people out, and even dragged them to the execution grounds themselves.

"I agree with the need, but did you really think you could kill this many innocent people and nothing would happen?"

Olivia says as they walk through the outskirts of Port Mokna.

"Shouldn't you have done some sort of purification ritual periodically?"

That's a reprimand.

Even if Riana hadn't foreseen that a spell would be cast, the priests and paladins should have done something about it.

At Olivia's words, one of the high priests walking by her side shook his head, his complexion turning white.

"Kyo, Master....... I didn't."

"You mean you did?"

"Yes, obviously......."

How to pound a stone bridge before you cross it.

I didn't see this coming, but even if I had killed it with my own hands, I was still performing purification rituals, prayers, and blessings regularly.

Olivia's mischievous expression hardened.

"So this happened despite the purification ritual."

Too many deaths.

Grudges, resentments, and injustices that cannot be resolved by periodic purification rituals and prayers.

Anger and hatred.

The fact that this is happening despite the blessing of so many priests suggests that this is not a normal occurrence.

Olivia and her group of priests were soon on the scene.

"I think things are getting worse and worse......."

Within a few days, the tinnitus that only Lucinil could feel was showing signs of materializing, to the point where Olivia felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up.

Some sort of ominous discomfort that you can't see but can feel on your skin.

Chilly air.

Olivia slowly approaches the pit Lucinil had seen earlier, hidden by the rocks, and stares into its depths.

"Whatever ...... is, it's bad."

Olivia was speechless as she saw the charred corpses, stacked in a pile so high she couldn't tell how many there were.

The charred remains of those killed by Liana de Granz's blitzkrieg.

'Crazy bitch, she killed them all with her own hands.......'

Olivia bit her lip as she watched the horrific sight, which she couldn't even begin to describe.

It was his decision, and he couldn't get anyone else's hands dirty, so he killed them all with his own.

Others may have sorted and dragged them, but it was Liana de Granz's own hands that drove them into the pit and suffocated them.

-oooooooooooo

The strange resonance of the wind in the deep pit sounded to Olivia like the cries of the wronged dead.

Olivia slowly backed away from the spot at the strange ringing, which was clearly an illusion, but felt like it wasn't.

You can stare at this mess for a long time, but it won't solve anything.

"Build a Sanctuary."

The good news is that Olivia's mastery of the power of Tuan, the god of purity, is perfect for this kind of thing.

At Olivia's command, the priests and paladins begin to bustle about.

What would have happened if we had left this alone.

If you're a little late.

If the silver-haired little old lady named Gazoo of Demand hadn't seen the signs coming, these spirits might have tried to harm him by causing some sort of miracle.

Hoping this will do the trick, Olivia summons Tiamata.

-Woof

Tiamata glows, and Olivia is plugged into the middle of the field.

-Bam!

Olivia watches as the priests draw the djinn and place the holy arcs in the correct order.

-oooooooooooo

Olivia is quite knowledgeable about spirits and reincarnations. Tuan is a god of purity who rejects uncleanliness, so he needs to understand the unclean and the unreasonable.

Olivia felt an odd sensation as she watched the howling winds of the plains swirl around her.

Olivia doesn't know how many people have died unjustly here.

But from a continental perspective, it's a handful of deaths.

Liana de Granz has committed an unforgivable sin, and Olivia has no intention of denying it. She just thinks it was necessary for Reinhardt's sake.

Thousands of people were dying.

That's not the only problem.

Just as a place filled with spiritual energy can become haunted, so too can a place become a lair for demons, a place of great resentment and hatred that attracts demons.

Those who died here.

Spirits, ghosts, and psychic phenomena that roam the world.

Slaughter.

The site of a massacre of the Demon's haters by the Demon's minions.

It's not just the people who died here that are the problem, the place itself is already attracting a huge number of demons.

And with most humans believing that everything is caused by the devil, all ghosts will hate the devil.

Demon-hating spirits are permeating this place.

Like a magnet or an anthill.

If Olivia's reasoning is true, this place becomes increasingly dangerous the longer it is left unattended.

No, it's probably already more than a little dangerous.

So Olivia was right to do something about the area before it became more dangerous and bigger.

Clearly, they are not wrong. Something needs to be done, and it's Olivia and the paladins and priests who can do it.

But it's not like we haven't had purification rituals before.

This is how far we've come, even with periodic cleanups.

Priests' prayers. Paladins' exorcisms. Exorcisms.

Was it really something that could work?

Olivia watches the priests move and thinks to herself.

To honor the memory of the man I killed.

Killing you innocently, but praying for you to ascend in silence, not in anger.

What the hell are you doing.

They are entitled to prayers, exorcisms, and purifications.

To the Paladins.

To the priests.

And to yourself.

Am I eligible?

If I were an original.

As he watched his murderers try to ascend him.

How do I feel about this?

What is this, the hypocrisy of devils going to hell.

I don't know if there's a better way to do it.

Something must be wrong with this.

"Wait!"

Scared to cry out, Olivia sensed that something was solidly wrong.

-Quiet!

From the pit, an abyss gushed forth.

Olivia's eyes widened, and she saw her hatred and resentment materialized.

-Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

An unidentifiable circumflex of pain, hatred, anger, or resentment.

No, it was a mixture of all of those things, and Olivia gritted her teeth as she watched it howl in agony, an embodied desire.

"Yeah."

Olivia draws a Tiamata stuck in the ground.

"This can't be easy."

Olivia's entire body was enveloped in a holy glow.
