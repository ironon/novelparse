Immortal Master Class I almost failed to subdue a single object.

If it weren't for the timely arrival of Cliff, we would have been in trouble.

"I knew you guys were here."

"Goma, thank you....... It was dangerous, really."

Breathing heavily, drenched in rain, Cliffman stares at Riana and Harriet.

Cliffman was fighting somewhere on the battlefield when he saw a barrage of artillery fire coming from the center of the Allied lines and knew Riana was here.

Then we realized that we were about to be attacked by something inside the Alliance, not a monster.

Riana staggers to her feet.

There was only one.

Even as a master class, it was only one of thousands of Immortals on this battlefield.

Neither Harriet nor Riana could stop that single entity, and it took an enormous amount of energy to do so.

And even though it was raining heavily, many were aware of the thunderbolts that rained down and exploded with tremendous force.

Somewhere on the battlefield, Cliffman sees it and rushes to protect Riana and Herriot.

Of course, what only Cliff could see, Immortals can also see.

Liana and Harriet look around in despair.

"More coming......."

I felt threatened for my life just to stop one object.

But now, across the battlefield, the Immortals have located Herriot and Riana and are approaching.

This time, it's not one.

Herriot grits his teeth as he sees immortals coming at him from all directions.

"We might have to move locations."

"Where?"

Herriot bit his lip at Riana's words.

This is a battlefield, and the Allies are already surrounded by monsters on all sides.

If you're going to run away, run away at all.

And running away means that someone else will have to deal with those immortals.

Is it important to survive.

Or is it important to reduce one more immortal?

To Herriot, who is at a crossroads, Kliffman says.

"Cast all the enhancement magic you can on me."

"Are you trying to deal with......?"

"Uh, I'll see what I can do, and if it doesn't work, run."

Cliff clears his throat.

You should do what you can.

You can only take it so far.

That's Kliffman's conclusion, and neither Liana nor Herriot deny it.

The magic star is still unleashing a fierce barrage of light on the monsters.

If Riana and Herriot run away from this spot, it will cost them more.

You have to hold on.

It's Kliffman who has to protect them.

The Demon's forces are strong, but they are outnumbered in absolute terms.

And there is no such thing as an obligation on the part of allies fighting to protect them.

It's up to you to keep it or kill it.

Cliffman's entire being is uplifted by the protection and strengthening spells Herriot has bestowed upon him.

You're out of a place where you have to fight.

But how many of you are holding your ground on this battlefield?

It's a fight to keep something.

As such, Klippmann has come to the defense of what must be defended.

But can you afford it?

I don't know why the immortals suddenly disappeared, and now they're back and trying to kill me.

In fact, you don't even need to know.

In a fight to defend something, it's only natural that Cliff would stand up to defend what he holds most dear.

"Hoooooo......."

Movements across the battlefield, approaching places they shouldn't be, are clearly indicative of the Immortal.

The Demon is pursued by thousands of Immortals from the depths of the battlefield.

Everyone is in a hurry to get things done.

No augmentation.

The good news is that outside of the master classes, the mages' attacks were being neutralized by Riana and Herriot with long-range sniping.

The real threats are the master classes that come charging in, counting on overwhelming antihorses and shields.

Riana and Heriot have an impact on the entire battlefield. Their deaths will cause irreparable damage to the entire battle.

Cliffman's best bet is to deal with the enemy in front of him.

Two that have become too big to fail.

I have to protect the monsters of the upcoming masterclass from topics that don't even make it to the masterclass.

That's a bit presumptuous.

Isn't that impossible?

Finally something like me.

Can you do that?

But I'm not standing here because I can, I'm standing here because I have to.

So, here we go.

Before enemies can get to it, you'll have to run.

I'm not quite at the level of a master class.

But right now, Cliffman's entire body was filled with a terrifying aura, not only from the blue magic barrier, but also from the sword in his hand.

-Currrrr!

There were fierce flames and thunderclaps, and a glow of magic as blue and thick as an auror's blade.

Herriot was working as much magic as he could.

The strongest wizards do the best they can.

That should do it.

Kliffman stabs his sword into the charging Immortal.

-Bam!

-Thump!

Obviously, the sword should have bounced off or shattered the body just by touching it.

But the body is intact, the weapon is intact.

You can.

There are limits to our bodies and capabilities, but there's magic behind them that knows no bounds.

-Flash!

It also supports Riana's powerful thunderbolts.

It's close enough to electrocute, but Herriot's protective magic prevents the blast from having much effect.

-cardeddup!

"Heh......up!"

-Bang!

After pushing aside the charging Immortal, Cliffman swings his sword as if in a daze.

Your body and mind immediately adapt to a state of being that you've never experienced before.

-Quack!

I pound, pound, pound on the Auror armor on Immortal's body.

In addition to Riana's blitz, Herriot somehow manages to tie up Immortal's feet so that only Cliff can hold on, giving her time to deliver the decisive blow.

-Bam!

Eventually, the sword lodges itself in Immortal's chest, and the powerful Auror enchantment within the sword itself explodes, reducing Immortal's flesh to dust.

"@AndreaMcGee....... 허억......."

One.

Processed.

With the help of a powerful wizard and the support of the most powerful psychic, Kliffman succeeded in taking on a being who had reached master class.

But just dividing those few sums was enough to make me physically ill.

And it gets better.

Dealing with one was enough, but the more intense and conspicuous the battle, the more the Immortals on the battlefield spotted the three and approached.

Can you do it.

Cliffman clears his throat, wiping the rain off his face.

Can you do it.

In the midst of his obsessive thoughts, Kliffman gritted his teeth.

I don't do it because I can, and never have anyway.

After Gate, every battle was like that.

There were any number of variables.

More enemies than expected, and enemies you didn't expect.

It was a daily occurrence for him to see his men die, and he would often return from the battlefield alone to find them all dead.

People thought Kliffman was an oddity.

He's been in fights with people who were better than him, but he always came out on top, even when they were all dead.

It wasn't a losing battle either.

Even though he was alone, he completed his mission and returned.

Uncanny powers.

The talent of combat is actually more of a superpower.

Even my friends say it now.

But Klippmann doesn't disagree.

He just thinks his talent is more luck than superpower.

I got lucky.

I couldn't help but think that was the case.

In a battle that would have killed even a master class, Cliffman somehow survived.

The only person who thought it was bizarre was Cliff himself.

Later, I even wondered if I had survived at the expense of others.

You didn't survive because you were strong.

You survived by taking away someone's luck.

After the most dangerous monsters and players stronger than him were wiped out, he killed the remaining monsters and survived.

That's why Kliffman considers his talent to be a matter of luck.

Only Cliff knows better than anyone else that he didn't survive because he fought well or was strong.

And on the battlefield, one man's luck is another man's bad luck.

Survived through someone else's bad luck.

Having seen it with his own eyes and experienced it countless times, Kliffman was extremely reluctant to fight alongside anyone.

If it's a talent for surviving and winning through the misfortune of others.

It's more of a curse.

So I kept pushing myself into a harsh battlefield.

He was willing to fight alone in the most dangerous places.

It was, in a sense, a plea to the unknown.

If winning any battle is my talent.

Let's see if we can save this one.

Let's see if I survive this one.

Let's see if I can survive the worst of it with no coworkers to sacrifice.

Just like that.

He volunteered for a suicidal mission and still survived.

It's not even that strong, and it always wins.

Always survive.

But I've never been happy to win.

Places you thought were dangerous weren't actually dangerous.

It was just a battle that could have been won.

Every day was another day of good fortune outside of those fights.

It was a victory and a curse.

Cliffman now realizes that his talent is not one of strength, but one of serendipity.

The serendipity of survival and rebirth.

If so, you may win the battle because you're here, but Riana and Herriot will die.

But I couldn't resist coming.

I didn't have the option of watching from afar, because I might end up killing them.

You see the oncoming Immortal forces all over the battlefield.

For now, you're not alone.

So, you have to fight to keep it.

So, Cliffman hopes.

His physical body has been strengthened by a great deal of auxiliary magic, and he can take on a master class.

But in the end, I have to be strong.

I have to be strong.

If you don't push the envelope, you'll only fall down.

So.

For today.

Just for today.

A talent that only guaranteed survival.

This time, may it be strong.

I accidentally dodge an enemy's sword, and someone else gets stabbed instead of me.

No more of that damned luck.

A sword that can pierce through enemies.

And may he manifest as a shield to protect his friends.

So.

A talent named Combat.

Hopefully that will change now.

Herriot's many spells of protection and empowerment.

And I don't know if it was a stabilizing type of magic that works on the mind or not.

Or maybe the damn talent answered your prayers.

However, in the face of the looming crisis, Kliffman's mind is as calm as ever.

"Hoooooooo......."

Clearing his throat, Cliffman's energy soon calms.

And the magic in the hand that holds the sword flows, more and more, through the sword.

"You......."

Riana stared at Cliffman's figure, wide-eyed.

Not heard.

We can only hope.

They just want to.

As if coincidence and luck weren't enough already.

Isn't it time for that to become fruit?

How long do we have to be miserable survivors of ridiculous luck?

Survival by accident is survival.

A life well-lived is a life well-lived.

I've definitely gained some experience in that time.

Coincidences eventually stack up and stack up until they become something that can no longer be a coincidence.

If you keep getting lucky, you'll eventually have to build up your experience and create something in the name of that luck.

Even the cursed misfortune of the past remains in the name of the experience of battle, and it was Cliff himself who carried it out.

Never.

No one else was fighting for you.

The experience of the moment is definitely something that builds and builds.

There is no doubt that the experience gained in the name of combat is a fortunate one, paid for by the blood of comrades-in-arms and comrades-in-arms.

To the point of overflowing.

In a flash, Klippmann's body disappears.

And.

-skuck!

The Immortals, who had rushed to the edge, were cut in two at the waist in unison.

Sudden awakening.

"......What is it?"

"What, what?"

Herriot and Riana were rather taken aback by the sight.

In the next moment, Cliffman lunges at Immortal, who is charging toward Riana and Harriet, swinging his sword at them.

In a body pushed to its limits, with the immense power of the world's most powerful wizards at its back.

The only thing missing was himself.

With that gap filled, it's no wonder Immortal doesn't notice Klippmann's approach.

No.

At this point, Klippmann may not really need Herriot's help anymore.

-Bang! bang! Ka-kang!

In three swift strokes, Kliffman's sword slashes through the opening in Immortal's chest, decapitating him.

Kliffman is neither shocked nor impressed.

With a calm, cool eye, he scans his next target, then moves on.

We pushed the envelope, but we didn't just pave the way to a master class.

Klippmann's change is a little different.

Eventually.

The damned luck that has always been with me was meant for this moment.

By luck, by chance, by survival.

It's for now, when you don't need it anymore.

No more chance, no more luck, no more luck.

Through the experience they've accumulated.

What you've been building by chance and luck has already reached critical mass.

As ever, at the end of a series of coincidences that force survival.

After accumulating experience.

It's a given that winning is inevitable.

It's about reaching a point where you no longer need luck to survive, to be alive, and to win.

To reach a point where you are destined to win.

It is, therefore, a developing talent that inherently teeters on the line between superpower and destiny.

So it is. A blood fate forged over countless sacrifices and deaths.

A talent named Battle (戰鬪).

Just like that, you're done.



* * *



-Shoot!

Suddenly, it starts to rain, and it must be Riana's power.

I understand where you're coming from.

In fact, the saturation of the wizards was becoming very inaccurate.

But the Immortals within range are in hot pursuit.

-Kugugung!

"Ugh......!"

With the Flames of Hweyo, with Tiamata, and with Alsbringer, we push through the waves of monsters.

Even though it's raining heavily, Huayo's flames explosively vaporize the rainwater into water vapor, blinding his pursuers. This is a good thing.

In effect, it focuses on moving forward rather than killing monsters.

There's no other way to describe this situation other than to say it sucks.

Immortals are missing.

It was hard to accept, but I knew what the situation was leading to.

So from the moment I showed up, I knew it was coming.

Immortal is back, and he's after me.

If Immortal succeeds in killing me, he will now send Olivia, Harriet, and Riana to find and kill the Lord Vampires.

It starts when I die.

When you die, the Immortal will try to find those who followed you.

So I shouldn't die.

In fact, it's not a bad thing.

Immortals follow you.

-knowwhat!

"Suck!"

-Thump!

I just need to move forward.

The Immortals follow me through the waves of monsters.

Ahead is a monster.

The back is an immortal.

This is what it looks like.

I was actually doing something that doesn't sound like running for your life into enemy territory.

It's more of a dash, a run for the hills.

Instead, you don't have to worry about attacking, you just move forward, jumping, stomping, and kicking monsters.

The whole thing will be swept away by the immortal.

"I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, you sons of bitches!"

Rather, he wields the flame of fire, the holy light of Tiamata, while cursing that he is here.

At the same time, it vaporizes the puddle with flames, blocking the view.

Or should I say, enticement.

If the monsters die and the immortals are destroyed, it's a win-win situation for me.

As long as you don't get caught up.

The moment I catch up, I'll be surrounded by thousands of Immortals, and I don't have the wits to survive that.

As I ran, I couldn't help but look back, even as I leapt over the monsters trying to tear me apart, because I needed to see how far my pursuers had gotten.

I've seen my fair share of scary things in my life, and I've seen my fair share of horrific things since Gate.

There were plenty of monsters that were just plain awful to look at.

"Crazy......."

However, the "fear" itself was never as strong as it is now.

No torrential downpour, no monstrous waves can stop them.

With blue Auror armor all over my body and Auror blades in my arsenal of spears, axes, swords, and other weapons, a thousand master classes are chasing after me.

There are those who cut their way through the monsters and kill them, and there are those like me who charge through them.

Masterclasses are the pinnacle of superhumanity.

Thousands of them are chasing me at breakneck speed, intent on killing me.

It's true that horrible-looking monsters are disgusting and scary.

But then comes the one that can literally crush and grind those terrible, terrifying creatures, moving dozens of meters in a single leap.

It's not hundreds, it's thousands.

-knowwhat!

The monster isn't even hit by a weapon, it's just bumped into and torn to pieces by the auror shockwave it generates.

They come in swarms.

There's no such thing as a choice to deal with it.

Run.

Because I have to live.

It's a way of life.

But very unfortunately.

-Wednesday!

-Quack!

"Ugh......!"

Immortal had a huge number of Archmages who could provide ranged support, not just checks.

A mass destruction spell covers the area above where I run.

Then the monster dies, and hopefully I die in a heap.

I can't really see where I am because of the rain, so I indiscriminately hit mass destruction spells.

Icy spears, thunderbolts, and random explosions.

And.

-Poof!

"Fuck......!"

The land is suddenly a swamp.

Thousands of swordmasters follow me, and blind archmages hurl destructive magic at me.

As if it doesn't matter if the immortal is swept away.

-Currrrr!

"Ugh!"

Grabbing the sinking monster by the horns, he rises, this time trampling over the creatures floundering in the swamp.

It might even be a good thing.

"Shit!"

But they come running, trampling other immortals as they sink into the swamp.

Even the sinkers come out floundering.

If anyone touches me, it's over.

Immortals are scarier than monsters.

-Quack!

"Turn off...... Yuck!"

And direct destructive magic goes to my head.

With the help of Auror armor and antimagic, it shouldn't be a fatal blow.

My magic alone would have killed a normal person hundreds of times over.

The moment you realize you're going to get caught by the Immortals for magical interference.

-knowwhat!

With a roar that tears through the sky, a breath of flame and thunder rains down on the Immortals following me, instantly separating me from them.

-Currrrrr!

The massive fuselage lands in front of me at a speed similar to that of a plummet to the ground.

I could clearly see the golden light atop the behemoth.

-Reinhardt! Get in!

Olivia on her dragon waves to me.

Are you here to save me?

What's that dragon?

I'm too busy to see what's happening on the battlefield.

One result: Olivia rode her dragon to my rescue.

But the answer is a given.

"No! Go!"

-What?!

"Come on, I have to stay here!"

It's my job to lure the Immortals and smash Diane.

If I run away, the immortal will instead attack other people.

And you may already be under attack.

Don't forget your value to attract immortals.

The more I risk, the faster the war ends.

So you can't leave it.

If I hesitate any longer, the Immortals will attack me and Olivia.

Then we both die.

I do this at my own risk.

"I said go!"

At my shout, Olivia no longer hesitates.

-profits......! You idiot!

Olivia screams it out loud.

-Don't die, fool!

-Kugugung!

The dragon in front of me leaps wildly, soaring through the downpour once more.

It's clear that everyone is doing more than they should.

So, like them, I have to do more than I can.

Where the thunderclap and flames had swept away.

Just run.

While luring immortals.

I'm Diane, on the front lines of this battle.
