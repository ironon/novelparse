            Episode 522.





After eating with his brothers, Heinrich was returning to the Temple garrison.

The time is night.

On his way home, Heinrich was thinking about what his older sister had told him.

I invited them to eat, but they didn't end up eating.

"I don't agree with Alphonse that the Empire is pushing you into operations that are too dangerous, but they are pushing you.

'I can't help it, given the circumstances, but you're royalty in Cernstadt, an important member of the royal family, one of the cornerstones of our future. It is quite uncomfortable for the Empire to have such a talent at its disposal.

'So I'm going to put you in the Cernstadt chain of command. That doesn't mean it will be permanent. There will come a time when you will be required to cooperate with the Temple forces, including Ellen Artorius, as well as the General Command, if necessary.'

'But before you were a student at the Temple, you were royalty in Cernstadt, and you are our brother.'

"Therefore, I believe it is right that we should have authority over matters concerning your personal life.

"He's the youngest. Do you agree?

Cornerstone.

Royalty.

Siblings.

Future.

The words from his sister's mouth tickled Heinrich's heart.

What a great thing to hear.

What a way to get a person's heart racing with just a few words.

No matter how much Heinrich wanted to hear it and how he was treated, it was strange to feel like he was really back in the family.

Heinrich walks through the garrison, where night has already fallen.

Yes.

That kind of power deserves to be recognized.

Heinrich stops in his tracks.

As if to put the brakes on the arrogance that once again reared its head.

You stop and look up at the night sky.

The.

It's just that it was lonely.

It's definitely weird to have your heart skip a beat at just a few words like that.

I'm just a weirdo because I was abandoned so early in life.

Come to think of it, Heinrich is royalty, but he has little memory of living like royalty.

So I don't even know what fraternization among royalty looks like.

So, you realize the strange realization that you're missing something you don't even know you're missing.

No favors are given for no reason.

That's true between siblings, and it's even more true when they're labeled royalty.

With power and influence, he was accepted as a brother again.

It's not about you, it's about power and influence.

Ruiz says he's going to get authorization from the High Command for his safety.

On the surface, the argument is that he is royalty in Cernstadt before he is a Temple student and Imperial citizen, and that he is important to the rebuilding of the country and should be protected, but the truth behind this is different.

Ruiz won't allow Heinrich to manipulate her without her permission.

This means strengthening Cernstadt's influence over the Allies.

Now that she's made herself useful, Louise wants to take control.

Brotherhood.

The truth that you don't even know, that you've never tried, that the drink is too sweet to drink. It shows up when you remove the false veil of emotion.

Consider Ellen's case.

Ellen Artorius is very important to the Alliance right now. Both as a morale booster and as an actual force.

The Allied Commander-in-Chief can decide which operations to deploy Ellen to.

You can direct Ellen to help the Cernstadt forces, you can direct her to help the Crusaders, or you can mobilize her to help other empires.

Every member of this coalition will want Ellen to fight alongside them.

If the decision-making power is in the hands of the high command, not Ellen, then everyone will be forced to meekly follow the dictates and orders of the high command.

It shouldn't be an emotional decision, but at the end of the day, the Alliance is a group of human beings.

If they don't get the support they need, they're going to suffer a lot of casualties.

Ellen can even clear the battlefield by herself.

Ellen has a single body, so if there are two operations going on at the same time, she can't help one.

The impact of having that decision-making power in the hands of the commander-in-chief can't be underestimated.

Heinrich's case is no different.

Already nearly unstoppable in melee, Ellen gained a wide range of offensive abilities when she awakened the Sun Relic.

Heinrich was more destructive than Ellen before she had that power.

Heinrich's destructive abilities really shine when faced with a large group.

So, instead of being subject to the influence of the General Staff as she is now, Louise is trying to gain control of an important strategic weapon, Heinrich's personal life, in order to gain influence in reverse. Heinrich's influence will begin to accrue the moment he is incorporated into Cernstadt's army.

Not because they're brothers, but because of their usefulness as weapons.

So what to do.

Do you really want to listen to your older sister, who is only out to take advantage of you under the guise of family?

You don't even consider yourself a brother, do you?

What good can come from being used by a brother whose only purpose is to be used?

An army on the march to save the world, to rebuild humanity.

Within that army, is there this conflict over the slightest bit of initiative?

Not too silly.

Too much.

Isn't this a little silly?

Why should there be conflicts of interest when there is only one goal?

Heinrich walks with a lonely look on his face, staring into the night sky.

"......whoops."

Heinrich does not know brotherhood. He was separated from his brothers too soon.

I don't know more about politics. I was removed from politics too early in life.

So both were too difficult for Heinrich.

Whether to listen to Louise or not.

Heinrich didn't know.



* * *



Back at the Temple garrison, Heinrich noticed a bit of a commotion inside.

It was Lanyon Sessor, playing his guitar in the center of the garrison.

Garrison guards, passing knights, and Temple students gathered around, listening to Lanyon's performance.

Lanyon Sesor, who leads the military band, travels to each garrison to play music and sing.

The gift of music.

Lanyon Sessor could play almost any instrument, as well as compose, conduct, and sing.

If this were peacetime, and Lanyon Sessor had been allowed to graduate from Temple as he should have, he would surely have become a performer, composer, and conductor whose name is known across the continent.

But at the beginning of humanity's final march, Lanyon Sesor plays music and sings for the soldiers who have lost or left their homes.

Music is a talent that is secondary to combat.

But Heinrich knew that Lanyon Sessor had a big role to play.

The value of music to energize the depressed, to calm the mind with a soothing performance, was something Heinrich felt every time he listened to Lanion play after Gate.

It's a talent that has nothing to do with combat, but it's a talent that people might need the most. Heinrich thinks.

He plays a guitar with a soothing melody and sings to people in a low voice.

It was a song with the message that one day there would be peace.

Most of the Temple garrison was listening to Lanion's song.

Lanyon Sessor has written quite a few songs since Gate.

In fact, there were quite a few songs about Ellen defeating the demon king Valier, and they were very popular.

When Lanion saw Ellen turn blue and gag when she heard the song in person, he stopped writing songs about her.

Songs about warriors are the most popular, but Lanyon hasn't written or sung a song about Ellen since.

Maybe it was the pressure, maybe it was something else, but I knew that Ellen was very afraid of those songs.

Heinrich could see Ellen out of the corner of his eye, perched on a crate, concentrating on the song.

Ellen carried so many burdens that she sometimes felt sorry for herself. Heinrich wasn't sure what had changed, but he noticed a necklace around Ellen's neck that he hadn't seen before.

And I saw her clutching the necklace with one hand as if it were something precious.

You've been looking tired lately, how did that work out for you?

Heinrich had his work cut out for him, but he knew that Ellen's burden was on a different level.

It's more than one person can handle.

"......Hmm?"

But Heinrich couldn't help but see something a little different.

People were so engrossed in Lanyon's music that they kept looking in Ellen's direction.

There was something on Ellen's lap.

"Cat?"

A black and white cat was sitting on Ellen's lap, and she kept stroking its back.

"Hey."

Turning at the sound of a voice addressed to him, he found himself face to face with the ever-singular Conor Lint.

"Uh....... Well. But what is that, a cat?"

At Heinrich's question, Konorint shrugged.

"Oh, you're late and don't realize it, but I've been in a frenzy today, with that cat, who just came in and ditched me."

"...... is it?"

"After Ellen came back, she just stuck to Ellen. I don't know if she knows what she's doing or not....... I'm glad Ellen seems to like it though."

Kono Lint looked at Ellen with a wistful look.

In Royal Class, everyone knows the stakes and the pressure Ellen is under.

Whereas elsewhere she was respected, admired, and expected, in Royal Class, Ellen was perceived as the unhappiest person in the world and someone who needed to be taken care of.

With a few exceptions.

Ellen continued to stroke the cat's back with a blank expression on her face, and the cat surrendered to the touch, looking at the garrison.

Cat.

It's a nuisance, but it doesn't have to be.

"I don't know if someone is secretly keeping a cat, or if someone had one and it escaped, but people love it, so maybe it's something."

"......, right?"

"Yeah, well, she seems to like it, so at this rate, she's going to be raising it, but does she have time for that?"

"Well, someone else will take care of that."

"......Yes."

Ellen has been looking extremely tired lately, but she's still focused on something. I don't know if it's comforting or not, but she's paying attention to something.

And that's it.

The sight of Ellen petting the cat was very foreign to Heinrich.

And Heinrich felt something was amiss.

The feeling that the cat is looking exactly at you.

Or should I say, stare.

It was a very bizarre feeling, like I was being looked at by an animal and somehow being read.

It occurred to me that it was looking at me exactly as I was looking at it.

"No way.

Heinrich smirked, thinking that the events of the day must have made him sensitive.

The performance continued, and Heinrich was intrigued by the cat's presence, but he didn't want to distract Ellen, who seemed to be concentrating on something else.

-Angel

When the cat meows low, Ellen nods idly and tickles the cat under the chin. Just as the cat seems to like her, Ellen seems to like the cat, though she can't quite tell.

Heinrich's idea was that anything that could revitalize this depressed garrison would be good.

It could be the music of Lanyon Sesor, or a kitten that appeared out of nowhere.

Kono Lindt thumps Heinrich on the shoulder.

"By the way, I got a letter today. I'm going to open it with the kids. What do you think?"

"Good."

At that, Heinrich nodded.

It was a quiet night, with low cat meows and the sounds of instruments and singing.
