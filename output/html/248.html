Fortunately, there was no attack until I ran with all my might, carrying Ellen, and reached the station.

Assassination is literally assassination, not fighting, so it's possible that he realized I noticed and backed off.

Even when I got to the station and boarded the magic train, I didn't stop to look around.

The upcoming assassination had been averted. But it was just as likely to happen elsewhere, just in a different location.

"Come on, Reinhard, come on."

As we boarded the magical train and I continued to break out in a cold sweat and keep my eyes on my surroundings, Ellen scanned my complexion with concern.

Ellen had been up and now she was down. The horse-drawn train wasn't full, so there were a few empty seats, but I was standing.

Without a word, I grabbed Ellen by the nape of her neck and pulled her into my arms.

"All of a sudden why......."

"Hold still, hold still, hold still."

Ellen seemed taken aback by my sudden hug.

He's weakened now. He can't fight right now.

It should be kept closest to you. If anyone tries to use it, summon Tiamata immediately. None of the passengers were paying attention to me and Ellen.

It's just that the kids in Temple uniforms get a few stares from the outside world, like they're trying to get laid.

I kept my distance from the passengers, pulling Ellen into my arms and watching the surroundings.

Ellen did as I asked and stayed quiet, asking no questions.

It was a cool day.

I was breaking out in a cold sweat all over.

"It stinks......."

Ellen, her nose buried in my chest, grumbled softly.

"Be still."

"......Yes."

In response to my confrontation, Ellen replied in a slightly croaky voice: "I'm sorry.



* * *



Nothing happened on the train until we got off at Temple Station.

Unlike the Rotary Club, Temple Station is a very high-traffic area. In a crowd, you never know when you might get a knife in the side.

So I waited for the crowd to clear out. Ellen knew I was serious and stuck close, not asking any questions.

Slowly, keeping your eyes peeled in all directions, you make your way out of the station. The assassin could be following.

Night was already falling, but there was a lot of foot traffic near the temple.

You shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security, though.

A madman killing two people on the sidewalk. It's entirely possible that if he decides he can't kill them, he'll just run them over without looking back.

I slowly made my way to the temple entrance with Ellen at my side.

You don't know if your temple is safe, but you should hope so. If the assassin is an outsider, they won't be able to enter the temple.

Just like eliminating a possibility, it's the right choice to go back to the template, even if it's not reassuring.

I slowly but surely made my way to the temple, ready to summon Tiamata at any time if anyone tried to get more than a little too close in the milling crowds.

It was too long.

As I passed through the temple entrance, I was greeted with a familiar view.

Only a few faculty and students come and go. No one looks suspicious.

But from the outside, no one looked suspicious.

Have you given up?

They seem to have noticed, so did they go back?

Even on the tram ride back to the Royal Class dormitory, I didn't let go of the last string of nerves.

Once we arrived at the royal class dorm, I was able to relax.

My heart pounded even louder.

Saved.

The assassin never came. For now, you've escaped the death that was scheduled for today.

My legs gave out.

"And now....... Are you okay?"

Ellen didn't know, so when she saw the relief on my face, she asked anxiously.

I pulled Ellen into a wordless hug.

"Why, why are you doing this......."

Ellen didn't say anything, just held me still as I shivered. As if to tell me to calm down.

I couldn't say anything.

I couldn't say anything.

I didn't know if I was afraid of my own death or of Ellen's.

But that fear is gone now.

That's it.



* * *



After being healed by the on-call priest, Ellen regained her strength.

In the middle of the night, in the rehearsal hall, I explained the situation to Ellen. I couldn't tell her the whole story.

"Who tried to kill us?"

"I don't know exactly, but it just felt like it."

"Shouldn't you be consulting ......?"

Ellen can't help but think I'm just being neurotic.

I can't even explain the preview, so I don't know what to say.

If an assassin attacked you, you'd know what I'm saying is true, but since nothing happened, you'd never know.

"Technically, he was trying to kill me, not you."

"......you? Why?"

"You went to the sponsorship meeting for the Magic Research Society grant last time."

"Yeah. I told you so."

"Because that's where I met someone named Saviolin Tana."

"I know, Chief Chanapelle."

Ellen nodded as if she recognized the name, which she rarely does.

"He said, 'You know, I've got a lot of enemies because of that whole Orbis class thing.'"

The mass measles the Orbis class would suffer, the damage it would cause. The displeasure the patrons would feel. The number of people who would hate me, the cause of it all, would be very high, Saviolin Tana said.

But I never thought they would go so far as to try to kill me. Of course, they're not the only suspects. They could be trying to kill me for some other reason I don't know.

"I'm not sure......."

Ellen still didn't seem to understand why I would suddenly do something like that under the circumstances.

"Still, if it's dangerous, don't go outside the temple anymore."

"......I should."

Ellen doesn't know if there really was an assassination attempt today or not. But she seems to agree that I'm in danger.

Ellen stares at me, still.

I messed up and ended up making a lot of enemies, enemies I couldn't handle.

"Don't die."

"I'm not dying."

"If you die, I die."

"What do you mean, all of a sudden?"

"I'm going to kill the person who killed you, and I'm going to die."

Ellen shrugged it off with a nonchalant expression.

"So, please, don't do anything dangerous."

Apparently, that was the point, and Ellen said so and squeezed my hand.

"I don't know about anything else, but....... I thought someone was going to kill me, too, so I thought....... Is that what you did?"

Ellen seemed to think I was trying to protect her the whole time.

"......Yes."

"If you're in the way, leave. I'm fine......."

"Bullshit."

With that, I pulled Ellen out of his arms and looked into his eyes.

"You're not the only one."

Ellen said she would die for me.

Just as Ellen was convicted in the Darklands, I had an epiphany upon returning to the Temple.

"I would die for you, too."

I, for one, could now return the favor.

Ellen's eyes widened at my words. She stared at me, then suddenly raised her hand.

-Bam!

"Eek!"

"Do you want to be an asshole?"

She laughed as she gave me the same answer I had given her back then, and the same chestnuts.

"Give me some food. I'm hungry."

I couldn't look at Ellen's smiling face properly.

Just because nothing happened doesn't mean it's over.



[Event Occurred - Assassination Threat].

[Explanation: someone is trying to kill you; crush or subdue the source of the provocation].

[Reward: One related trait].



The event occurred a long time ago.

Rewards are abstract. However, trait-giving events have usually had powerful rewards.

But it's an event, it's a fluke, and lives are at stake, and we can't put a price on it. This is work that needs to be done without reward.

In addition to making me dodge death, the preview created a problem that I had to solve.

Someone, or some group, is trying to kill me. I need to determine their identity. They may be a group, or they may be a vengeful individual.

But who the hell is trying to kill me and for what reason.

The biggest one is the Orbis class. But in that case, killing me would be simple revenge. Killing me wouldn't solve anything.

Above all.

I don't know anything else, but I want to make sure I find the assassin.

It didn't happen, but he killed not only me, but Ellen as well.

Make sure you find it.

I don't know if it's right to seek revenge for something that didn't happen or not.

Anyone who does that for a living deserves to die.

He didn't kill me, he didn't kill Ellen, but he tried to.

It must be found and killed.

And I'm going to find out who's behind it and make them pay.

It was the first time I'd ever been so cruel, but in my mind, it wasn't a rejection.

I am not reassured. I don't take it for granted that my enemies are only outside the temple. There could be people inside the Temple who want to kill me, too.

Don't let go of the tension.

I wore disposable protection bracelets all the time.

While listening to the lecture and walking around the temple, I was paying attention to everything around me.

You never know if it'll give you one more preview when another threat is coming. You can't rely on a dirty trickster.

I felt like I was being drained alive.

The only place you can be sure is in the royal class dorms.

Unfortunately, it's hard to use connections in this situation.

Even Ellen, who was with me, thought I was being neurotic when I said there was an assassin.

If nothing happens and I go running around looking for help saying someone is trying to kill me, I have no proof.

You'll mess up here and there and end up looking like you've lost your mind.

I felt dirty.

If someone is trying to kill you, it's true, but to others it sounds like bullshit.

I need proof, and that would require me to actually be attacked by an assassin. And it's unclear whether or not I'll survive the process.

Of course, you could try to force Bertus, Charlotte, or the Temple to somehow protect you or help you, but they will probably take steps to prevent you from leaving the Temple.

In such a situation, I would rather not play my most important card.

Because I have allies that only I can handle.

I sent the letter outside the temple. Going out myself would be dangerous now that nothing is known.

A few days later.

Someone knocked on my window.

One bird.

It pecks at the window as if it has something to say.

I opened the window and the little bird flew into my room in a flurry of shrieks, and I drew the curtains.

Last time it was Maid, this time it's Sara.

The little bird chirped and took on the form of a dainty user in a maid's outfit.

"Jae-hyung, it's been a while."

It was Sarkegar.

I wrote to Loyar at the Rotary Club and relayed the message in our own code word, "Send Sarkegar to the Temple," and he arrived shortly thereafter.

I don't think I'm a good leader.

I tend to favor my subordinates, not for work-related reasons, but for personal reasons.

He's the epitome of a boss in reverse.

I tend to visit Elise for no particular reason, just to chat about Temple life. She's a good listener.

Loyar tends to visit for work-related reasons.

Sarkozy, on the other hand, who goes by the pseudonym Count Argonne Pontheus, is rarely seen. I don't even know where he lives.

And then there's the part where I feel like the tension is always a little bit too high, and I feel like if you've been through me, you'll know that I'm not really interested in rebuilding the Demon Realm, so I kind of stay away from it.

I hadn't seen Sarkhegar in a very long time. Of course, it was in my private room, but it was a temple, so he didn't say anything unnecessary.

"I knew you were on the rise. Not to mention that you've already taken control of the transportation network of the Yellow Road......."

"Never mind."

"Yep."

Cancel.

I hadn't seen him in a long time and he started talking nonsense. He was obviously thrilled that I had called him.

"God, I would enter the fires of hell for degradation. Whatever you command."

I wish you'd stop saying such horrible things in your beautiful, soothing voice.

"I'm not asking you to go to the fires of hell, but I think I'm going to go to the fires of hell now."

"......What do you mean, degradation?"

"I think someone is trying to kill me."

"What kind of lowly horde of chewing, killing fiends would plot such a thing!"

They say that what you see is what you get, and Sarkegar, dressed as a maid, looked cute.

"If you say the word, I will tear them limb from limb and hang them on the cross for daring to try to kill the demonic enemy......."

"Why do they do that in the ecliptic?"

I told Sarkeghar, who was quite excited to hear that my life was in danger, the details of the incident. What had happened, and how it had made me many enemies.

"Um, so you're saying we don't know who's trying to degrade it yet?"

"Yeah, but I'm sure there is, I have a pretty strong gut feeling."

"Intuition, a great monarch must have great intuition. Your instincts are unmistakable. We will find this assassin and those behind him, Zhao Hai."

I love the idea of infinite trust.

It wasn't that they needed Sarkhegar's power. The only way to reach these creatures outside the Temple was to use Sarkhegar as a messenger.

Count Argonne Pontheus is recognizable in his own right, but there are other groups as well.

"Tell Elise about this, tell Loyaar, and tell the Thieves' Guild."

"Yes, let's all work together to stamp out those nefarious forces that seek to degrade us."

Well.

By human standards, if they're trying to kill a demon prince, they're not cruel, they're heroes and saviors of humanity.

Sarkozy is on my side, so I guess I can say that.



* * *



My Temple connections won't believe me because they think I'm not credible. So I have to do what I can.

I wish an assassin had attacked me that day, it would have made things easier.

I'm not sure I've ever had such a bizarre thought.

If I did, many of my allies would have risen up and tried to find the assassin.

It's entirely possible that the assassin is not an organization, but an individual with a vendetta against you, in which case it would be extremely difficult to catch them.

I don't have a list of suspects in my head.

However, it's too much.

There's a lot of people out there who have a grudge against me.

So we'll just have to take it one day at a time.

It's an erasure method, eliminating possibilities.
