            Episode 591.





Crusader Knight Commander Elayon Bolton.

The successor to former Crusader Knightmaster Revere Lance, who stepped down from the position due to what he did to his adopted daughter, Olivia Lance.

He was pro-Imperial, but only in comparison to Leviathan, not in the sense that he was fully embedded in the Empire.

Leviathan Lance dreamed of establishing a Holy Empire completely independent of the Crusader Knights and the forces of the Five Great Houses, and he intended to make the first High Priestess of that Holy Empire his adopted daughter.

He dreamed of an empire of gods called the Holy City, divided into five schools of thought, and a pope who ruled over them.

Of course, very few knew of his ambition, and he was forced to put an end to his long dream by being killed by a demon.

Compared to such a Leviathan, Elion Bolton is a more centrist figure.

Good enough. Someone who thinks the status quo is the best we can do with the forces we have and the resources we have.

As such, he was a natural fit for the powers that be.

The fact that the organization is still around after the events of the Gate proves that Elayon Bolton is more than capable of leading the Crusaders.

Ellen was alone in the meeting with the Crusader Commander.

But while I was alone in the room, the visit itself was accompanied by a group.

Ludwig, Heinrich.

And Louise von Schwarz.

The other three were not in the interview room, but were in a separate room waiting for the interview to end.

That was Louise's opinion.

Ellen asked if it would be better to wait outside so Louise wouldn't get caught up in a nasty argument, but Louise shook her head.

"Come with me, but do the talking.

"Don't you think it's better to be face-to-face together? If we're going to be separate, it's better if they don't know we're here together.

If you're going to go with them, go with them to the meeting with the Crusader Commander, or at least make sure they don't know you're there.

Ellen thought that was good.

I wondered if I shouldn't have come to the meeting in the first place.

"Just the fact that you're not here alone puts pressure on them.

'The Grand Master of the Templars must take my presence into account because you and I have come together, but I have my reasons for following my youngest friend to the High Temple of the Templars.'

"They won't believe you for that reason, but you don't realize how many problems you can get away with for that obvious reason, because all that matters is how you look.

'It will be much easier for you to talk to me if I'm not there.'

"Do you understand what I mean?

Listening to Louise's explanation, Ellen nodded.

"Okay, I see what you mean.

Like Ellen, Louise's mere presence is significant. The Crusader Knights may not actually talk to Louise von Schwarz, but they can't help but feel her presence.

So even in the unlikely event that the crusader leader had strange intentions for Ellen, he would have to give it some serious thought before he acted.

Ellen is a warrior in her own right, but she is also a guest with the heir to the Schwarz family.

Therefore, the conclusion is that to deceive Ellen is to deceive a warrior, but also to deceive the Schwarz family.

Presence can backfire if you overdo it, and Ruiz knew how to use it in moderation.

So Ellen waited alone in the interview room while the rest of the group waited in another room.

A warrior's name is never taken lightly.

Ordinary people couldn't ask for an audience, and even if they could, they'd have to wait until the crusader leader had finished his business.

But just because Ellen is here, the Crusader leader must stop what he's doing and come to the interview room.

If Ellen says she wants to see the crusader, it's no different than if she says she wants to see a horse and tells it to get in front of me right now.

It took less than ten minutes for Ellen to arrive in front of the Great Hall of the Templars, to reach the interview room, and to see the face of the Grand Master of the Templars.

-delay

When the door to the reception room opened, revealing the leader of the Crusader Knights, Elayon Bolton, Ellen rose from her seat and bowed to him.

"Hello."

As Ellen greeted him, Elayon Bolton stroked his shortly shaven beard thoughtfully.

"Hmm. I didn't expect to see you on the ecliptic."

"I see."

Ellen is very polite, but she is fairly polite. Even when she met Louise von Schwarz, she only said hello.

The emperor and the cider are at odds because of their temple days.

So Ellen is not particularly polite to anyone.

Of course, there's no one in the world to point that out. Not then, not now.

"Sit down."

"Yes."

When invited to sit down, Ellen took a seat on the couch, and Elion Bolton sat across from her.

They're pretty familiar with each other.

I've actually been on the battlefield with the crusader leader, and I've seen Ellen in meetings, even if she's not always there.

But it's not often that I get to come back to the ecliptic and see you at the Great Hall of the Crusaders.

Just before the gates burst.

Ellen was there the day Olivia Lanchette went on a rant about Reinhardt's whereabouts.

I don't think that was the first time.

Ellen thought to herself.

I wasn't sitting there for a good reason then, and I'm sure I'm not sitting there now.

Ellen is polite, but she doesn't talk back.

"Do you know why I'm here?"

"......."

Elion Bolton is silent for a moment.

"We've been informed that you entered the scene of a temple fire."

"Tell me from start to finish, what's what. What you know and what you don't know."

Ellen said nonchalantly, without changing her expression.

"You knew you'd come out like this."

This had never happened before, and Elion Bolton smiled bitterly.

"I do it when I have to."

Ellen knows how to be rude when she needs to be rude.

"If you're not going to tell me, what are you going to do?"

At that, Ellen pauses for a moment.

"I'm going to ask until you tell me."

I could lie here all day and no one would touch Ellen's body.

Even if it's the crusader himself.



* * *



Ellen demanded the truth from Elion Bolton, half threateningly.

But the answer was simple.

"I don't know."

"......."

Ellen stares at Elion Bolton, stunned by the bluntness of the answer.

"You don't think I'm going to believe that."

"What you don't know, you don't know."

Ellen tries to figure out how to slip in a lie that is so casual.

If your opponent is consistent with the mortar, what the heck are you supposed to do?

"Are you saying that Archbishop Rowen in the temple wasn't part of the Crusader Order? I didn't know he was part of the Tuan Order....... What are you talking about?"

"No, Archbishop Rowen was a member of the Crusaders. He is the Inquisitor of the Crusader Order and the one in charge of the Inquisitors of the Zodiac."

As Ellen had seen and thought, Archbishop Rowen was indeed the head of the Inquisition.

"So, you're saying you didn't know he was torturing refugees in the basement of the temple?"

"To be precise, we didn't know about it until now."

"......Are you trying to make a pun?"

Ellen didn't know where to begin to point out that the leader of the Crusade Knights didn't know what he was supposed to know.

Ellen glares at him, and he stares down at the table.

"I'll have to make excuses for my incompetence."

"Incompetent......?"

"Yeah, incompetence."

The Crusaders look at Ellen, still, and say.

"I've been commanding paladins and priests as a crusader in the Alliance, and I've only been back in the ecliptic for a little over a week now."

"......."

"Is it so hard to believe that I couldn't help not knowing what was going on in the ecliptic?"

The Crusader Commander was busy.

It's been busy as hell.

Hence my statement that I couldn't care less and didn't know what was going on with the Crusaders of the Yellow Dawn and the Five Great Houses.

I wasn't competent enough to bother with that, so I ended up being incompetent enough to not know.

If nothing else, Ellen couldn't deny that Elion Bolton was being honest with her.

The Alliance is not just an army of the Empire. It is an army of many surviving nations, as well as the Mages' Guild, the Duchy of Saint-Tuan, the Army of Cernstadt, and many other groups and nations.

As such, each army is subdivided and the direction of the army is determined by the General Headquarters.

The Crusader Knights are a very important part of the Alliance, as is the Cernstadt Army, one of the largest of which includes the Kaiser's Army.

Just as the Emperor was busy, Louise von Schwarz, commander of the Cernstadt army, was unable to leave the Allies until the King handed over command of the army.

The leader of the Crusader Knights, Elayon Bolton, was also unable to leave the Allied lines.

"I don't know if you'll understand, Warrior, but the Crusader Knights are not a simple group."

Elion Bolton slams his fingers down on the table.

"The Crusader Knights are a coalition of the Five Lords."

"Of course I know that."

"It means an empire formed by the union of five imperial states."

"......."

It's a blasphemous statement, but it's semantically correct. The Crusaders are already a small empire in their own right.

"But the leader of the Crusaders is not the Emperor."

"......!"

Ellen couldn't help but roll her eyes.

Ellen, apparently, said that a few days ago in response to Ludwig's question.

The position of Crusader is above Cardinal and below Pope, and only as high as the Pope.

When human nations come together to form an empire, an emperor emerges, but when the five orders come together to elect a crusader knight, he is no more than a pope; he merely leads the group by proxy.

"Do you understand me when I say that I commanded the Crusader Knights of the Alliance as a Crusader Knight Commander, and as such, there are bound to be matters of the Order or Knights that I do not know about?"

While the Grand Master of the Crusade is in retirement, the five Popes are not in retirement. And the Knights Templar have no authority to command the popes.

If the Popes are hiding something from the Templars, the Templars may not know about it.

Ignorance is not bliss.

Ellen doesn't realize that just waging war is a daunting task.

Seriously, the Crusader Templar had no idea.



* * *



Elion Bolton could not help but be ignorant of the affairs of the ecliptic.

This was partly because he might be overwhelmed with the task of conducting the war, and partly because the Popes were responsible for the affairs of the Order of the Zodiac and were not obligated to relay them to Elayon Bolton.

The Templars are nominally less powerful than the popes, so the pope's failure to inform the Templars about the affairs of the Imperium is not a dereliction of duty, but rather something they had no reason to do in the first place.

Elion Boulton didn't say the popes were weird.

The fact that the current Crusader Knight Commander is unaware of the situation in the Zodiac is not a surprise. It just leaves a lot of room for Ellen's imagination.

"I knew that Archbishop Rowen was fulfilling his duties as the leader of the Inquisition in the Eclipse. But I didn't realize he was torturing heretics."

"And I was contacted this morning and dispatched paladins, because it's not good for civilians to go into a place like that."

"It was my orders to secure the site and hide the underground facility."

"Like I said, you can see why."

"But we don't know what Archbishop Lowen was doing."

"I'm just hiding things that people shouldn't see."

Ellen listened to Elion Bolton's words in silence.

With all the attention the fire received, it was impossible to bury the incident quietly.

If his story is true, Elayon Bolton had his paladins deliberately collapse the building, burying the staircase to the basement in rubble.

The event had already happened, there was a massacre and a fire. He was lucky the looters hadn't gone underground and buried him alive.

Soon.

He doesn't know the raiders, and he doesn't know why Archbishop Rowen was killed.

Faced with the task of cleaning up the crime scene and uncovering the truth, Elion Bolton did just that.

The paladins on the scene also knew that the place was a temple of the Inquisitors, but they didn't know what happened.

If word got out that he was capturing and torturing people in the temple's basement, it would only make the Ecliptic's bad reputation worse, so there was nothing Elayon Bolton could do but clean up the mess.

And it was Ellen who went into the field to get a sense of what was going on.

Elayon Bolton doesn't know what Rowen was doing, and he'd have a hard enough time getting back to the ecliptic to figure it out in the first place.

"Really, you don't know anything?"

"I don't know, but I can make a guess."

Elion Bolton stares at Ellen for a moment.

He's supposed to be in the Allied camp, but he didn't just come back in the first place.

"Recently, the cemetery in the basement of the Crusader Knights was robbed."

It was information that very few people knew, but Ellen had heard it across the street. A big event, but one she'd forgotten about because it had nothing to do with her.

"Are you sure you don't want that job at......?"

"Yeah."

Elion Bolton nods.

"I would have been looking into that."

The leader of the Crusader Knights had returned to the Imperium to find out what had happened, and the heresy inquisitors who had remained in the Imperium in the first place must also be investigating.

It's a big deal that we can't let go of, even though other factions or people might be like, "Oh, that happened to us.

"It was refugees who looted that cemetery....... Is that right?"

At Ellen's words, Elayon Bolton shook his head in disbelief.

"We can't know that far. And there are no treasures buried in the tombs of saints."

Elion Bolton looks at Ellen and says, "You're right.

"It wasn't the treasure that was stolen, it was the remains."

"Is that ......?"

Of course, there was no way Ellen could know the truth.
