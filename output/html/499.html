            Episode 499.





Olivia Ranze and the priests take a moment to marvel at the arrival of the giant army of spirits, but then they have to get down to business.

The fight against the unidentifiable masses of demons was taking on a form that I wasn't sure if I should call a fight or not.

The enormous, overwhelming figure of hate suddenly tore through the air into a pile of dozens of souls, plummeting to the ground and crashing down on the paladins and priests.

-Crrrrrrrrr!

-Ah....... Two, Tuan.......

The spirits quickly overtook the paladins and priests, and they began to cry out in agony, fainting and clutching their heads with foam in their mouths.

-Puck! Puck!

Unable to withstand the strain on their minds and bodies, their bodies and faces began to swell in a puffy mass, and one by one they began to burst.

Those who didn't explode began to exhibit strange behavior.

-Quiet!

-skuck!

As if overwhelmed by something, he began to swing his sword indiscriminately at the priests and paladins around him.

"Possession......."

It's not uncommon for evil spirits and demons to possess humans and do nasty things to them.

However, it was capable of possessing and wielding highly trained paladins and priests.

They were powerful and overwhelming demons.

Some have even had their bodies disintegrate under the weight of the demonic possession.

They were the most powerful spirits the world had ever seen.

The fragments of the original demon protruding from the torn body of the priestess begin to rampage, looking for their next host.

You don't know what to do with the possessed, but you must deal with them before they possess you.

Olivia runs toward the rampaging spirits.

"Judgment on those who have strayed from the path of purity."

Tiamata responds to Olivia's holy chant and begins to glow a brilliant golden color.

You can't think about justification.

At this rate, the priesthood will be wiped out.

You have to do everything you can.

"Peace to those who have no rest."

-Woof!

As Olivia lunges at the creature, which is trying to find its next host, she roughly stabs Tiamata.

"Power to destroy all that is beyond reason."

-Flash!

-Kaahhhhhh!

"Be in my hands!"

Olivia Ranze is the only priest in the world who doesn't appeal to God.

-Crack!

Olivia and the other priests could clearly see the storm-like release of golden divine power, and how the demons it engulfed were torn into a thousand pieces in an instant.

Olivia calls out to the priests.

"It's not something you can't defeat! Harden your heart and face it! It's just a bunch of demons that can't die and wander the world!"

Everyone in the priesthood gritted their teeth at Olivia's harsh cry.

They are the great powers against the unclean.

No matter how much time you've spent dealing with monsters, it's more in the nature of priests to confront and exorcize these unholy beings.

So don't panic.

No matter how powerful the demon, no matter how powerful the grudge.

Obviously, it can be destroyed.

The devil is back.

After saying he might be gone for a while, he returned less than a month later.

But when the entourage saw the returning demon, they couldn't help but notice the strangeness of Reinhardt's appearance.

"Reinhard......?"

"Long time no see. How are you?"

"Uh-huh. It's me....... You said it would take forever....... At least you're early. Why are you touching your hair......."

Reinhardt's expression was indelibly pleased as he touched Herriot's head, saying he'd missed her.

His demeanor, eyes, and demeanor were that of a man who had spent a very long time in a very faraway place.

There was something different about not only the look in his eyes, but the momentum itself.

Instead of feeling anxious and impatient, I felt like I was well prepared, with a certain sense of relaxation and calm.

"And Charlotte?"

"I'll be in the Oval Office."

"Everything okay?"

"Oh....... that......."

"Why, did something happen?"

"That's....... You'd be better off listening to Charlotte."

It's not like the seasons have changed, but time did eventually pass.

So, it was inevitable that something would happen while the devil was away.



* * *



I realize that there is no perfect justice in the world.

It was clear to me that if I chose something, I would lose something.

I also knew that when you sit down to make too many decisions, you're bound to sacrifice someone because you think you're making a good choice for everyone.

But every time the things I knew in my head became true and stared me in the face, I had to realize that this position was too much for me.

"Riana is......?"

"Yes."

Riana was sifting through the refugees.

I've lost count of how many survivors have died at Riana's hands.

I nodded dumbly, listening to Charlotte's sobering report.

I was worried that something big was going to happen in my absence.

But the stool was already there.

It was still going on as I sat there.

I just didn't realize it.

"So until you get back and make a new judgment, we're suspending all survivor searches, and we're suspending all base relocation efforts."

After all, I'm in charge.

Charlotte halted all progress, reserving all judgment until I returned.

Regardless of what happened, I can't help but admire Charlotte's abilities.

I hadn't even realized it until now, and then I saw it in the report.

At the end of the day, it's not people like me who should be in this position, it's Charlotte.

"By the way, where have you been? You said you were going to be a while, and I thought you wouldn't be back for a while......."

Charlotte shook her head.

"And something....... seems to have changed a lot."

"Really?"

"Yeah, I don't know how to say it, but......."

Just as Harriet looked a little unfamiliar with me, Charlotte seemed to feel a little unfamiliar with me.

As Charlotte spoke, I was at a loss for words.

I've spent quite a bit of time in a world where time flows differently from reality.

If you come back and say that no time has passed, will you believe me?

"Where did you go and what did you do?"

"Um......."

I can't talk about the monthly fee directly. Luna didn't tell me to keep quiet about the monthly fee, but it wouldn't do me any good to go around talking about it.

But if you ask me what I did in Lizaira, I don't really have a reason to hide it.

It's not like there's anything wrong with that, right?

If I do say so myself, what I did for a few months was pretty bizarre.

"I'm back from chopping wood and plowing fields."

"......?"

Charlotte thought I was making some kind of joke or something, and she tried to force herself to laugh.



* * *



We need to think about Riana's problem.

It wasn't just a question of whether or not to punish Riana, but that wasn't the only problem Charlotte told me.

Some deep pit outside of Mott Mokna that Riana drove people into and killed.

"One soul?"

"Yeah, the Master of Demand said there might be a problem later because of all the listening that's going on there."

Apparently, Charlotte has already briefed the Senate on the matter.

I've seen ghosts in action on Vampire Council. But I've heard that it doesn't have much impact in the real world.

However, Lucinil realized that too many demons could have real-world consequences.

"Well, for starters, the Holy Order's prefect, Olivia Ranze, was dispatched this morning, so she might be the right person for the job."

"I see."

"Actually, I don't know that we need to do anything, because if we abandoned Port Mokna, that would solve the problem....... But they want to get rid of the fire roots."

With Tuan's divine power, and Olivia sharing Tiamata with me, she would be able to exorcise or purify a great many spirits.

The gathering spirits may cause some problems, but Olivia has already been dispatched to deal with them.

"And the Empire has now begun organizing a massive expeditionary force to take over the remaining gates."

Taking down gates that were once impossible with a handful of commandos.

Now the Empire is organizing a massive army to break the last of the gates.

The collective might of humanity will be gathered, and one by one, we will wage an all-out war to destroy the remaining warp gates.

The strongest and last army humanity has ever organized.

Without that army, humanity would be doomed.

"We'll have to do something about that."

You can't help them overtly, but you should think of ways to support them behind the scenes.

After all, gating is everyone's problem.

"Anyway, great job while I was gone."

"Uh, huh? No, what....... It's a job to be done......."

Charlotte's face flushed a little at my coined phrase.

I learned something I didn't want to know, but I needed to know.

She can see and read things that I can't. So, I think it was a good idea to bring Charlotte to Edina.



* * *



Upon returning from Rizaira, I realized that not only was the world out of whack, but Edina was out of whack, too.

The most urgent decision was about Riana.

I could have called a meeting of the Senate to make a decision, but I decided to confront Riana face-to-face.

I know she's been cheating on me, but she's been doing it under the guise that she's making a judgment call for me.

Whatever it is, we need to talk about it.

I was hoping to find Elyse or Lucinil among the Lord Vampires, but they were absent, and the only one left in the castle was Antrianus, who had returned from an intelligence gathering trip.

"You're back, great one."

As always, it's been a while since we've seen Antirrhynchus being as polite as possible on the outside while being vicious on the inside.

I never thought I'd see the day when I'd look back on this old man with fondness.

"I got the job done faster than I thought I would."

"That's a good thing."

It wasn't actually a quick fix, but the more I talked about it, the more complicated it became, so I had to skirt around it.

Until this morning, I was in Rizaila.

I had the odd feeling that every moment of my stay in Rizaira had suddenly become an incredibly distant past.

There will never be a day when I can return to Rizaira, and I shouldn't hope for it.

Because even if everything works out the way I wish it would, I still have a ton of people to answer to.

So pretend you've had a very long, very long dream.

I couldn't imagine a life like that, and being suddenly thrown into it was a luxury.

"By the way, since you're looking for me, do you have somewhere to be?"

"I need to go to Port Mokna."

"Ah....... You mean that place? I hear there's been a lot of bad stuff going on there lately."

Antirrhinus smiled, as if he knew why I wanted to go there.

To be honest, I don't know the exact situation there, so I don't know the level of the actual threat.

"Well, I'll get right on it."

Antrianus begins casting Mass Teleport.
