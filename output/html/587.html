Heinrich, Ludwig, Ellen, and Louise.

The four of them abruptly left the temple, leaving the cat behind, of course. Not a good place to be.

We all had our hoods up because it included people who didn't like to be in the spotlight and people who shouldn't be in the spotlight.

There's no reason to be stealthy, but you don't need to be overly conspicuous either.

Heinrich, however, looked guiltily at the snow on the streets and the countless guards clearing it.

Ellen, who has been leading the way, looks at Ludwig.

"Tell me everything you know about that priest."

"About Rowen......?"

"Yes."

"Does it....... important?"

"In some cases."

Ellen didn't bother to explain to Ludwig why the story about Rowen was important.

Ludwig began to tell the story as best he could.

The name is Rowen.

His rank as a priest is Archbishop.

And that he was tasked with cleaning up the mess while being escorted by a guard.

"An archbishop-level priest wandering the streets alone, things must be pretty bad."

"Yes......."

"Hmmm....... It must be that way. Most of the priests and paladins will be with the Alliance, and the Tuan priests are absolutely dwindling in numbers......."

There are so many places that need priests that an archbishop-level priest would have to roam alone, and so few of them.

Louise nodded as if she understood what I meant.

It might help your case if you tell us everything you know about Rowen.

Although Rowen is already dead, Ludwig considers how much he knows about her.

I don't think he deserved to die, but Ludwig didn't know much about Rowen.

We've only been working together for a little under a week, so we don't know much.

But then Ludwig remembers.

A story about an archbishop.

"......I heard about that."

"What story?"

"Father Rowen was originally a bishop, but after the Gate debacle, he became an archbishop......."

At that, Ellen and Heinrich nod slowly.

"There are so many vacancies, someone has to fill them, and you've been given an undeserved position....... I'm pretty sure that's what I heard."

Ludwig's ability to put clues together and deduce something is poor, but his memory is by no means bad.

You are not a lord who has lost a province.

She was actually ordained an archbishop in the wake of Gate.

"If you're talking about an archbishop with an extremely reduced archdiocese to manage, you're talking about someone who wasn't really an archbishop in the role of archbishop."

Ellen says as she walks away.

"He probably had a different job title, and he probably had different duties than he actually had."

Right now, they don't know what they're chasing, but they know what they need to focus on.

It's also important to have a good idea of who Rowen is.

Ludwig couldn't help but feel strange.

A dead person.

He's been murdered, but Ellen is asking about a different victim, not the fire scene or the suspect's description.

But Ellen might be sensing something she doesn't see, and Ludwig can only squeeze out what he knows.

"Before we broke up yesterday, I asked you what you really do for a living."

"What did you say?"

Ludwig's words were echoed by Heinrich.

"I'm looking into the strange things that happen in refugee camps."....... He says he's been doing cleanup work and learning about the strange things that happen in refugee camps....... Strange things happen in places where so many people die, he says, and he tries to deal with them if he can......."

"You recognize strange things?"

"Apparently....... and that's what you're doing."

At Ludwig's words, Louise nods slowly in her robes.

"If you don't read too much into it, you're trying to respond to an unspecified situation in a refugee camp....... If you think about the slightly risky possibility......."

Louise says still.

"I've been keeping my finger on the pulse of everything going on in the refugee camps....... I guess that means the same thing."

"That's....... What do you mean, sister?"

At Heinrich's question, Louise glares at her son.

"His actual role may have been intelligence gathering or surveillance of the refugee camps."

The answer was not Louise, but Ellen.

"Do the Crusader Knights or the Order of Tuan have any organizations involved in intelligence gathering?"

"Um......."

Just discussing the possibilities was getting me to the point where I was wondering if this was a problem I shouldn't touch.

"With the combined power of the Five Great Lords, the Crusader Knights are a force more powerful than most nations."

"Right."

"If a force of that size doesn't have an internal organization dedicated to intelligence gathering, that's even weirder."

"Wait....... So you're saying that Ms. Rowen was a spy or something....... or something?"

Ludwig said, puzzled.

"And, why do you only keep talking about....... you keep talking about......."

Rowen is a victim and a victimizer.

But Ellen and Louise were talking as if Rowen was the key to the case.

As if it were a suspect.

"Ludwig."

"Uh, uh......."

Ellen looks at Ludwig.

"If this is simply the work of angry people, there's nothing I can do about it."

"......."

"If Rowen was an ordinary priest, someone who really only did purification work, he would be a victim of injustice."

Ellen says, looking at Ludwig, whose expression is getting harder and harder.

"But if Archbishop Rowen wasn't an ordinary priest, this wouldn't be ordinary."

Archbishop Lowen.

The case depends on who she was.

In a normal case, there's nothing Ellen can do.

"If it's not something out of the ordinary, I might be able to figure something out."

Only if it's suspicious will you be able to figure it out.

The simpler the original case, the harder it is to solve, and the more complex the case, the easier it is to find clues.

Ellen focuses on the victim first, rather than the suspects, to see if there are any complications in the case.

"That's why I'm asking."

Nothing is certain yet.

I'm just asking, just in case.

Ellen added and walked away.

At the edge of the road, with the burned-out temple in the distance, the group is forced to stop.

"Of course, it's under control."

Louise said, and we all nodded.

"It's not the Guard, it's the Crusaders."

As Ludwig had been told by the head of the Guard, the scene of the crime was already being guarded by troops of the Crusader Knights, not the Guard.

There were a few people milling around the burned-out temple, but most of them just walked by, shrugging off any sparks.

"I cannot touch the affairs of the imperial court, and I cannot touch the affairs of the Crusaders. You know what that means, don't you?"

"Yes."

She was a curious individual with too much on her shoulders to move.

She wants to help Ludwig, but only to the extent that it doesn't cross her personal boundaries. When people start to suspect her intentions, something even stranger happens.

"I have no intention of getting close. Youngest, you're in a different situation than I am, but there's no harm in getting too close."

"Yes, sister."

Heinrich nodded, his expression steadfast, as if he understood Louise's concern.

Louise doesn't need to get involved in the Crusaders' affairs because of her political stance.

She could only offer advice, and had no intention of getting involved in the case.

Add to that the fact that Ludwig is no different from a civilian in the eyes of the Crusaders, and they won't give him a pass.

But whether it's an imperial case or a Crusader case, there's someone with intangible, massive power that can go anywhere.

Ramen and Rafelt.

There is no such thing as a door that won't open in the presence of two holy relics.

"Ludwig, you follow me."

And don't be afraid to bring a friend along for the ride.

What Ellen did was simple.

"What's going on?"

He approached the paladins cordoning off the burning temple, removed his hood, and spoke a few words.

"Yo, warrior......?"

The paladin in charge of blocking the entrance froze at the sight of Ellen, his gaze darting inside the temple.

Ellen does not hold a position with the Crusader Knights or the Great High Priestess.

However, being the owner of two holy relics already symbolizes more power than the Pope or the leader of the Crusaders.

Going against Ellen is like going against God.

"Last night, a mob set fire to this temple and slaughtered the priests, so the Templars are being sent to identify and preserve the site."

The paladin nodded at Ellen's question.

"Do you mind if I take a look inside?"

"There is a risk of collapse due to the fire, brave, if you enter......."

"If a building ten times bigger than this collapses, it's okay."

"Well, you may be the only one, but even outsiders......."

The paladin balked at the idea of bringing Ludwig in, not even alone.

"He's a friend of mine."

"But......."

"Is there a problem?"

The paladin was speechless at Ellen's words.

Ellen is an agent of God.

No matter where his orders come from, they can't outweigh Ellen's words.

Ellen didn't bother to wait for the paladin's answer, as he couldn't do either.

There wasn't a large paladin anywhere who dared to grab Ellen by the shoulders.

We're in the middle of nowhere, but Ellen doesn't mind being in the middle of nowhere.

It's just that she doesn't actively try to take advantage of them, and when she does, she's the kind of person who can get away with anything.

The burned-out temple had a partially collapsed roof and was in a precarious position where it could collapse at any moment.

So it was only natural that the paladins guarding the entrance would say it was dangerous for Ellen to enter.

"They're following.

But Ellen noticed something else.

Ellen entered the scene, followed by a paladin. They were mice before a feral cat.

Ellen looks around the interior of the temple. The chairs and other items in the temple have been burned, and the stone walls are covered in soot.

Ludwig, understandably, had a bad complexion.

The fire was contained, but I saw countless bodies here.

Now that I was back at the scene, I couldn't help but replay the scene from the morning in my head.

"What happened?"

"We're not sure yet because we're still investigating, but it's believed that unspecified people stormed the temple, looted the goods, killed the priests, and then set it on fire."

Even within the Crusaders themselves, it's unclear how the events unfolded.

"Do we have a casualty count?"

"Three laymen, three priests, and seven temple workers....... All were found dead."

Ellen nodded as she listened.

'We don't know the size of the mob, but....... It would have been impossible to put up much of a fight.'

The temple wasn't very large to begin with, but it was also very thinly staffed. This was inevitable, as the Tuan Sect's power had declined.

'All dead....... It's not that weird of a situation to be mobbed.'

This temple was too small.

This makes it very likely that Louise and Ellen's assumption that an archbishop-level priest would not be easily killed by the people is incorrect.
