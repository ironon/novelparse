            Episode 485.





Luna had told me that she might not be able to teach me something properly.

True to her word, Luna never taught me anything after that.

A quote from Ellen's childhood friend, Lena.

A passing remark resonated with me that if you rush too much, you don't get to do the things you can do.

Luna's comment about being overly emotional was somewhat in line with Lena's.

But being calm wasn't going to make that happen.

I had too many other things on my mind.

No matter how much I told myself I'd put it off for later, it only made me more anxious that it was all out of my hands.

Luna still hadn't taught me anything, and I continued to practice my enchantments in the clearing, feeling nervous and anxious.

"I packed you a lunch, eat it."

"Uh....... That, uh....... Thanks."

Lena would come by occasionally to give me water or bring me lunch.

I felt a little embarrassed, and Lena seemed to pick up on it.

"Auntie Luna took care of it for you, do you think I would have done it myself?"

"......Ah, yeah."

No.

I need teaching, not lunchboxes.

It's clear that Luna had a thought, I just didn't understand it.

Luna Artorius was unknowingly looking out for me without giving me the help I really needed.

At a crude wooden table in a vacant lot, I ate a sandwich with hard bread, ham, and vegetables.

Auntie Luna, by the way.

My first impression of Luna Artorius was that of a transcendent absolute.

In Rizaira, she's no more than a neighborhood lady.

Auntie (world's best, packs lunches).

"By the way, you look a lot like Auntie Luna and Ellen, don't you?"

"Sure."

The resemblance was almost too good to be true. Of course, if you look closely, Ellen was a little bit older.

Still, Ellen is now 20 years old and an adult. But that doesn't mean she looks exactly like Luna anymore.

"Ronan looks a lot like Ragan, and no, that's weird because Ragan looks a lot like Ronan."

Lena chuckled, as if she hadn't realized how funny she sounded.

Lena says, and stares off toward the village.

"You feel it too, right?"

"......what?"

"My town, it's a little weird."

I hadn't expected Lena to say this, so I was taken aback.

Seriously, does Lena have no more idea what kind of town Lizaira is than I do?

"It's weird, because when you look at Aunt Luna, she doesn't look like she's aging at all."

"ah......."

Her uncannily long face was free of blemishes and showed no signs of age.

On the other hand, Ronan Artorius doesn't show a lot of signs of age, but it's definitely there.

I was pretty excited to find out that my neighbor Lena thought it was weird too.

"From the time I was very young to now, Aunt Luna hasn't changed."

"Really?"

"Yes."

Lena leaned her face close to mine and lowered her voice to a whisper.

"And, you know, sometimes there are old ladies and gentlemen in the neighborhood, and you call them Auntie Luna?"

"...... is it?"

"Yeah. He doesn't do that when the kids are around, but when we're not around, he calls me that, like he's on a pedestal."

Per Month.

I had a vague idea that Luna Artorius was something special, even in Lizaira.

So maybe it's only natural that the elderly should be treated with respect.

"I thought you'd tell me what's what when I got older, but I don't know if it's because I'm not old enough yet, or if you just don't want to tell us at all. You don't tell us anything?"

Lena pouted, as if she was secretly disappointed by that.

-Busy

"Lena, don't talk nonsense to a stranger."

With a low voice from Lizaira's side, someone appeared.

"Huh? Arta. What are you doing here?"

One of Ellen's two childhood friends. His name was Arta.

A blunt, sharp-looking man.

If Lena is on the sassy side, this guy is like a personality flip.

Arta hasn't seemed to pay much attention to me so far.

"Hey, outsider."

"Uh. Why."

The bluntness of the call did not produce a polished response.

"It's kind of sad to see you doing this alone, let's practice together."

He rummaged around in the vacant warehouse and brought out two wooden swords.

-Whoosh!

I lightly catch the wooden sword he throws at me.

"Do you know how to use a weapon?"

Arta narrowed her brow slightly at my question.

"No, I don't write well."

He then points a wooden sword at me.

"Compared to the lagan type."

I said no.

In the end, it was just a matter of being good at it.

Lena looked at us in the middle of our confrontation to see if we were going to argue.

Arta stood still, staring at me, her wooden sword pointed at me.

I don't see any particular momentum.

I don't know where the line is drawn between what's special about Lizaira and what's not, but Lena is definitely normal, and Arta doesn't seem special either.

Enchantment is not an ability that can be learned by just anyone.

It is a power that only a select few can realize. Even in temples that have scoured the continents for talent, only a few succeed in enhancing their powers, and even then only belatedly.

Ellen and I were a very special case, having awakened to magical enhancement at seventeen.

Ellen, who became a master class at the age of eighteen, is almost certainly a unique case.

Also, it's safe to say that I'm pretty much the only one who can take on a master class with just a power boost.

So no matter how special Rizaira is, Arta is no match for me.

If Arta is around twenty years old, it's not a very special case that she hasn't yet realized the power of enchantment. In fact, it's quite common.

Because.

I didn't want to go in with a bunch of enchantments just because my opponent couldn't enchant, even though he was a bit of an overpowered guy.

For technology, see Technology.

Me, I'm losing to Ellen, not so much anymore.

Arta takes a step, a forward step.

-Tak!

Moment.

Missed a move.

-Bam!

Almost instinctively, I defended my flank, and there was a cheerful clang of a wooden sword.

"What."

Arta pulls back, this time pointing her wooden sword in front of her.

"Isn't that too shallow?"

-Whoosh!

The wooden sword that grazed my right cheek made a menacing crackling sound.

The speed and destructive power was palpable.

"You."

This asshole.

"What is it?"

I'm not even enchanted, so how can I make this move?

-Whoosh!

I brought my knee up to strike at his head for getting too close to me, but he twisted and dodged to the side.

"Well."

Arta shakes her head.

"What do you think?"

He spins the wooden sword in the air a few times, then points it at me again.

Lena is normal, but.

This guy was no ordinary guy.

I don't know what it is, but he's not to be trifled with.

I have an ability average of over A-rank without using any enchantments.

The guy who doesn't use enchantments moves similarly to me.

-curl!

Arta smiles at me, blue flames all over her body.

I threw down the wooden sword in my right hand.

I don't need a weapon that can't withstand my power.

"Oh."

Arta laughs.

"Actually, I like it better."

He threw down his wooden sword.



* * *



I don't specialize in hand-to-hand combat, but it's not like I can't do it.

Because swordsmanship isn't the only thing I learned from Ellen.

-Bang!

But that's weird.

-Woof!

This is, obviously, weird.

He and I bumped fists, and a menacing ripple swept through the clearing.

He crossed his arms to block the fist I threw at him and bounced back.

If you have enhanced your flesh with Enchantment, your flesh will be harder than iron, depending on your Enchantment output.

I manage to block it by crossing my arms, shake it off, and it leaps right back at me.

-Bam!

I felt a dull thud as I blocked his top kick with the top of my left arm.

Arta's destructive power is beyond the reach of the naked body.

This doesn't make sense.

No matter how strong your body is, there is no such thing as a level of physical strength that enhances the strength of your body. That can only be accomplished through the release of energized magic.

-Thump!

-Bam!

-Puck!

-Bam!

I even watched in disbelief as his back kick missed me and kicked a tree behind me, snapping it in half.

Does this make sense?

It's a feat only possible for me, who has enhanced my physical abilities in a way that borders on cheating, but Arta is doing it with his bare body.

It wasn't as if he had blue magic wrapped around him.

How is this possible.

How does it make sense that there's a guy with more bare-bones power than me using a cheat that literally doesn't exist in the world?

Is there such a thing as a fair play that is greater than foul play?

Unconcerned with how my head was spinning, Arta went on the offensive.

-Bang! Quack! Chirp!

The clash of bare and enchanted flesh swept across the clearing, stirring up dust with every step, and digging deep into the dry earth with every step.

The technology was there, the power was there.

But the overall output will never be able to match mine.

He lunges at me and I catch him trying to pivot his left foot back on its axis for a kick.

I quickly lower my stance, kicking out my left foot, which is its axis.

"!"

-Bang!

In the blink of an eye, you've lost your balance and are about to deliver a decisive blow to the fallen guy.

-pot!

Arta backed away, one hand on the ground, bouncing backward, almost acrobatically, to keep her distance.

"Not bad. I lose."

Arta threw up her hands in defeat and shook her head.

It's not a done deal, but it's like they've come to terms with the fact that they're going to have to keep trying.

However, I couldn't figure it out.

"You, what?"

"Hmm?"

I don't understand it at all.

"How can he move like that when he can't even enhance his magic? How can he hold on?"

"......Ah. I said something."

Arta shrugs.

"I've been using that all along?"

"......what?"

His body was still, but a stream of blue energy could be seen in his flesh.

If you don't do this, you won't see it, so I'm showing it to you on purpose.

"Do you have to see it to know it?"

Sophisticated mana enhancements that don't even require mana to flow outward.

I felt like everything I knew about common sense had been denied.

Does Rizaira teach enchantment as well?

Are Lena and Arta something, something different?

Ellen wasn't this good.

Does Arta have anything to do with Rizaira's secret?

"Well, in the end, you're stronger than me, but let me tell you something, hmm....... Your magic enhancement is....... I guess you could say......."

Arta looks at me and shakes her head.

"It's ridiculously inefficient."

Luna says.

Lena's words, followed by Arta's.

I finally realized what my problem was.



* * *



Two years after Gate.

With the ability to boost my status points with achievement points, my physical abilities have improved by leaps and bounds.

I'd say it's more of an anomaly than a leap.

He had cheated his way to an accomplishment that no one else could have achieved through hard work.

As such, I have increased his horsepower rank to SS due to his unusual growth.

so I felt like I was getting a master class on a topic that could only be enchanted.

But the only thing that went up was the output itself, not my skills.

No, it's not a level that hasn't risen.

If anything, it's regressed.

"Your enchantment is a projection of your mind, and your enchantment is very wild and unruly."

At Arta's words, I could only nod dumbly.

"I don't know what's going on with your body, but an enchantment like yours should break it down. It's strange that it's not broken."

It's just that my body can handle my rough ways because I have strong underlying physical abilities.

I strengthen my flesh as I forcefully release powerful magic.

It's a wonder I'm able to tolerate it at all, but the enchantments I do in the first place are like gnawing at myself.

It wasn't always that way, but somehow it became that way.

So, while I was able to beat Arta in power, I couldn't keep up with him in the technical department.

Sophisticated disenchantment that doesn't even show signs of disenchantment.

If Arta can convert nearly 9% of her hp into power, I can't even convert half of my hp into power.

It's not overly efficient, but the high absolute value of the output makes up for it.

I won the practice match, but I was feeling defeated.

Power is important in horsepower, but since I can't add more power, what I can do is increase efficiency.

When my power enhancement took the form of a giant blue flame, it meant that the power was burning incomplete.

This method is just a force stamp.

This needs to be fixed.

"......Thanks."

What Luna didn't teach me, Arta, oddly enough, did.

No, she knew this was going to happen.

"What's in it for me?"

Arta shrugged, but said nothing.
