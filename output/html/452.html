            Episode 452.





Razak, the main port city and capital of the Edina Archipelago, had only one warp gate, and it was small.

It wasn't long after the event that Reinhardt started bringing people in to help with the broader response.

Eleris destroyed the warp gate before it could reach Razak, Riana summoned lightning bolts across the land to wipe out the monsters, and Reinhardt and Olivia, as well as Leruen and Galarsh, worked to rid Razak of its monsters.

So things calmed down pretty quickly.

Still, the Gate debacle left an indelible mark on Razak.

Countless buildings were burning, and bodies lined the streets.

The monsters were mostly gone, but the streets were filled with the cries of people.

The gate situation is basically designed to create fear and confusion in people.

In the midst of the fear and panic, it would be difficult to deal with the creature, and even if they could, the damage would be immense.

It is unlikely that every location with a small warp gate will have an archmage or combat troops stationed there.

Even though we were on top of it the first day, there was a lot of damage in Razak, and I don't think it would be any different elsewhere.

Unless it was a city with powerful wizards and knights, it was likely to be destroyed rather than damaged on this scale, and a city with that level of military presence would inevitably have medium to large warp gates, which would increase the number and size of the monsters that would emerge.

Riana and Olivia couldn't help but freeze as they watched Razak turn into a living hell in a single day.

No matter how much they say they're doing it to save Reinhardt, this is the work of the Devil's minions.

Activating Akasha with her own hands, Eleris was speechless as she realized the depth of her crime.

The Razak situation has been sorted out to some extent.

So we gathered at the front door of Angel Capital.

Valier the Demon, Elise, Lerouen, Galash, Olivia, Airi, and of course, Herriot and Liana.

Everyone was staring at Valerie.

After firing up Akasha, Eleris couldn't keep her head up.

But there was no despair on the face of Valier, who had tried to stop this from happening and had started it all.

I've tried to stop all of this, and everyone is feeling miserable and bitter, even though they didn't do anything to cause it.

The devil didn't seem to think about any of that.

"Razak's been cleared, so there's no time to lose, and I think we can handle the monsters coming out of the miniature gates on our own....... Airi, how many islands in the archipelago have miniature warp gates?"

"......It's St. Louis, Fort Lambs, and Greenwinds."

"Okay, let's split up into groups of three. Elise, take Riana, get the coordinates for St. Louis and head there. You and Olivia will go to Fort Ramsey, and the Greenwyns will have Harriet back soon, so I think you can take her and clean up after her."

They were to divide their forces between three different ports, the only large cities in the tiny Edina Archipelago.

It was his judgment that two of them in this room would be enough to handle the small warp gate.

"We need to move fast, because if the monsters overrun the city and get away with it, we might be in for a tedious scavenger hunt."

As if he didn't have enough time to express his feelings about the devastation that had occurred, Valier was brief with instructions on what to do next.

It seemed like the kind of attitude a party leader should have, but it also seemed too cold.

But directives.

At the Demon's command, the road vampires begin casting.

Still fearful of the situation, those hiding in Angel Capital stare at the city's saviors beyond the front door.

Bali didn't give them the slightest glance.

As if it was their job to save them, but now that they've been saved, there's nothing more to do.

"Airy."

"Uh, ah....... Yeah."

Airi still doesn't know what's going on. Valerie was only saying what she had to say.

"Let's go to the Royal Palace of Edina."

"The Royal Palace......? The Royal Palace is....... Why?"

"I'm going to be king here from today."

As if to say, I'm going to make it happen because I said so.

The volley was too casual.

For everything.

Late at night.

-currrr

The burning zodiacal gradient had mages scrambling to put out the flames.

The ecliptic, home to humanity's greatest powers.

However, the city of Ecliptic Gradient is home to the largest concentration of super-sized warp gates on the entire continent, as well as the largest concentration of small and medium-sized warp gates.

The most dangerous city, the Gate of the Zodiac, was subdued within a day, thanks to humanity's greatest powers, who jumped into action as soon as it happened.

But the damage was done.

In addition to the destruction and burning of the city's major infrastructure, as much as a third of the city was destroyed and more than a quarter of its citizens were killed.

Like the port cities of the Edina Archipelago, the Zodiacal Gradient was filled with the screams and wails of countless people.

And it's better that way.

Everywhere in the Empire, where warp gates were installed, there were worse scourges raging.

-Woof!

The last of the Zodiac's monsters has fallen, as the cathedral-sized beast crumbles to the ground with a final crash.

-Crack!

In a flash, Ellen Artorius, who had climbed the creature from its legs to its shoulders, plunged her Voidblade into its skull and crushed its skull with a blast of magic, landed on its back and waist as it crumbled to the ground.

Now everyone knows that Ellen not only has a bizarrely deformed lament, but also a sun god's cloak, the Rapelt.

"Is this the last one?"

At Ellen's words, the men who had hunted the last monster nodded in agreement.

What's done is done.

Just focusing on coping is urgent.

Just as the current Demon King doesn't give any indication of his feelings about everything, Ellen is no different, seeing herself as the cause of this mess.

Similarly, the knights of Shanapelle, who had hunted down the last giant monster, arrived at Ellen's location.

"Ellen....... Why on earth would....... helped the devil escape?"

At Savior Tana's words, Ellen stares at her.

Up until this point, I'd been too busy reacting to the situation to talk about it, but now I had to.

Ellen helped the demon escape.

There were no casualties, but Ellen's actions may have led to another war in the future.

But Ellen didn't make any excuses or rationalizations for her actions.

I didn't say that this happened because you didn't believe in the devil.

Ellen herself didn't believe in the devil.

"Are you going to arrest me?"

"......."

"I don't think so."

So Ellen gives the empire a dose of reality, not reason.

This is no ordinary Swordmaster, but one with two holy relics.

In fact, Ellen had killed the most monsters today, second only to Saviolin Tana. Not the smaller ones that come out of the Edina Archipelago, but the giant ones, the ones that are so powerful that a single one can reduce a village to ashes in an hour.

The last thing we need is to treat Ellen like a criminal in a situation where we all feel sorry for her.

Maybe after all is said and done, but for now, the Empire should be grateful that Ellen is cooperating.

"Please tell me where I should go. There must be a lot of dangerous cities."

Ellen feels responsible for the situation.

"Also, if you have any stimulants, please bring them with you."

As such, Ellen had no intention of taking a break.

There is no such thing as time to be sad and depressed.

There's no time to be remorseful about your actions.

Just as Reinhardt doesn't beat himself up about how nothing would have happened if he hadn't done anything.

Ellen didn't take the path of regret, telling herself that if she had trusted Reinhardt more, none of this would have happened.

You can't save yourself, and you can't save others, with a tragic appreciation of the devastation that has occurred.

You'll have to make that judgment at that time.

You have to move in time for that.

We must save one more city, one more person.

Because they think it's the only thing they can do.

It's not about regret or self-pity, it's about doing the best you can under the circumstances.

Demons and heroes.

Both, in a sense, are stronger than before.

In ways neither of them ever wanted.

The palace of the kingdom of Edina was located on the outskirts of the port city of Rajak, on a cliffside of a high hill.

It was never as large as the Imperial Palace, nor was it as elegant as the White Palace of Arnaria, located in Arnaka, the capital of the Duchy of Saint Thuan.

More of a citadel than a palace, the size of the castle was a measure of the quality of the Edina Kingdom.

Still, it was the royal castle of a nation. It was not the humble scale of a lord's castle or manor house on a provincial estate.

The castle was on the outskirts of the city and was not directly affected by the gate incident.

It wasn't hard to get directions to the castle.

I think he had some idea of the upheaval in the city, and that it was me and my crew who were organizing it, when he saw me and Airi walking up to the castle.

And Airi had been doing business in the city for quite some time. And this angel capital business had been going on with the support of the royal family.

Airi's friends.

The man who, in a matter of hours, put an end to a cataclysmic, kingdom-destroying event in the capital.

It was strange that the door wouldn't open.

In the real world, the king was still blue in the face, and his vassals had no idea what was going on, so it was no wonder they panicked.

"You are....... Who are you?"

Guards.

Bodyguard knights at the king's side.

I look at their facets.

"While the people of the capital are dying like dogs, this bastard of a king is here, shivering and sleeping......."

The sudden outburst stiffened the king and his guards.

"I'm not going to bother explaining anything."

Using Sarkegar's Ring, I summoned Alsbringer and slung it over my shoulder. I could feel everyone's breath catch in their throats at the sudden appearance of a demon and a soul-bound sword.

"From this day forward, this kingdom and all the islands of the Edina Archipelago belong to me, Valie the Demon."

Airi's face turned white at my blunt remark.

There's no time for persuasion and debate.

I look around.

"No sneaky bastard."

Still, it was clear that we weren't quite sure what was going on.



* * *



Of course, no one is going to give up their country just because you ask them to.

The first to react was the knight standing next to the king.

"Bastard, no matter how suspicious the circumstances, you come out of nowhere and defy His Highness!"

He descended the steps of the throne and rested his hand on the hilt of his sword.

"Don't pull it."

"What......?"

I said so towards the article.

"If you pull it, you die."

"You insolent......!"

-Thwack!

-Bam!

The knight who drew his sword was struck by Alsbringer before he could even leave his scabbard, and his sword shattered as if it had exploded.

Didn't kill it.

But before I could get a good grip on the sword, the lost knight was just looking at me with a dumbfounded expression on his face.

"If you try to do more, you'll end up with a warning."

If we need to see blood, we will, but we don't need to see it on purpose.

He was probably the most skilled knight in the room, and as he froze, neither the other knights nor the guards approached me easily.

I passed the driver who cut in front of me.

No knights and guards stood in my way.

-jerky

Climbing the steps to the throne room, I stood before the king.

"Get out of the way."

"What......?"

At that simple statement, the king froze and stared at me blankly.

"Get out of the way."

No one ever laid a hand on me. I think it was because they realized that if they tried to touch me, I would run for my life.

The king looked around, but it seemed that no one would dare risk their lives to defend their lord in the presence of a demon.

It's not about loyalty.

Because I'm not just a thug, I'm a demon.

He's a demon that makes entire continents go crazy.

This is a country that couldn't even handle a small gate situation and nearly destroyed its capital.

The Devil was too big a name for the soldiers and knights of the Edina Archipelago to handle.

He's not just a rogue or a ruffian, he's a demon.

No one knows what will happen if I start to get my hands dirty, so just by showing my true colors, I stir up people's sinister imaginations.

The reputation of fear that has been cast upon you is yours to exploit if you choose to do so.

That's why I'm able to do this, barefoot and with only an iriman.

Son of Valier the Ancestor, who was an absolute.

No one can touch me because I'm playing out terrifying fantasies in my head about what he could do.

I watched as the king shakily rose from his seat.

-Hair

He sits on the throne of an absent king.





I didn't love the gray rock hewn throne, but I didn't love it either.

Sitting in the master's chair was easy.

I can't believe it's so easy to steal a country.

But it's a start.

You may be the boss, but not everyone recognizes you as such.

Sitting on a throne doesn't make you a king.

However, I made the master of the throne stand up on his own.

That's important.

"Half the world."

"Lord of all the lands of the Darklands."

"Leader of all the demons in the world."

"Demon Lord."

"In the name of Valerie."

"To the previous kings and royalty of the Kingdom of Edina, who have surrendered their thrones to me, I promise you a long life in peace."

Well, that was my first royal name.
