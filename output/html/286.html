            Episode 286.





Even the crazy, rootless event called a cross-dressing competition is called a competition after all. It is a legitimate event, promoted by the Student Government Association and approved by Temple.

Not only is there a prize for the winner, but it's a well-structured competition.

The good news is that there are so few participants that there are no qualifiers.

We don't need cross-dressing dudes doing charm offensive bullshit to get to the finalists.

Straight to the finals. They come out by number, make their pitch, go around the room, and then we vote for a winner.

You can't become a completely different person, but you can put on a different outfit and change your vibe a little bit, and if someone who knows you sees you, they won't be able to tell.

I have a cheat key for this situation, the Ring of Sarkhegar.......

I feel like such a dog for saying this, but.......

There's no way there's anyone prettier than me there.......

So first, we need a dress to wear to the competition.

And you have to decide what kind of bullshit you're going to do to sell yourself....... what kind of bullshit to do when appealing.......

Should we dance or sing?

I really, really want to cry. I can't tell you how many times I've been frustrated and sad about my life here, but I've never been so frustrated that I feel like I'm going to cry.

To me....... What are you really doing to me.......

You must never be seen as Reinhardt, lest anyone guess it's you. You'll also need to tuck in your usual shitty temper.

If you suddenly turn around and do a hard turn, somebody might say, "That's Reinhardt, isn't it?

Most of the people who come to the tournament don't know me, but there are some who have heard of my notoriety, and I think there's a very high probability that Kono Lint will come.

It didn't take long for Eleris to return.

Empty-handed.

"Hmmm....... Well, first of all. that....... I went to the boutique and saw....... Most of the dresses are custom made, so....... They say they have to take your measurements and make them....... Of course, there are some made-to-order ones, but....... It's not quite right for you to wear......."

"......."

My height is about 181.

You can turn into the Ring of Sarkegar, but it's an adventure to adjust your height just in case.

Why did you leave the pageant?

No, but he was short back then.

What did you do?

You might say, "Well, I'd rather be short than tall.

"Let's get her a dress with a long skirt. You'll be able to say you were bending your legs, and you'll be a little shorter."

"Oh, you mean hoop skirts."

I don't know what that means, but I think it's called a hoop skirt.

Shorten your height with Sarkozy's ring. If you cover your legs with a bulky hoop skirt dress, you'll have the excuse that you were bending your knees if you get caught.

Now that I'm shorter, they're less likely to recognize me.

As long as the organizers are good at keeping it secret.

I feel like I'm losing, but I can't help it, because I'm already preparing myself for discovery. Body shape is something that I can control to a certain extent, so I can make my body fit the clothes instead of the clothes fitting my body.

Eleris said she'd better get back to work then, and turned to leave.

"Well, that....... I think the sleeves should be, uh, long."

If you could see my biceps, that would be a little weird, too! Hearing my words, Elise's lips trembled again and she nodded.

"Oh, that....... Yeah....... degradation."

Sickness.

Fucking real.

I seriously hate myself for thinking about how to be a proper crossdresser!

Still....... I have to win.......

You can't help it if you want to win....... I'd really want to kill myself if I came in second.......

As I waited for Elise, who had gone out to buy a dress, I stared blankly at the ceiling, my mouth open.

The appeal is....... What the hell am I supposed to do.......

Someone, please, kill me.

In the end, all I did on Sunday was prepare for a cross-dressing contest.

Right now I have to focus on the main event of the tournament, which starts tomorrow.......

Why do I feel like I'm treating the pageant more importantly?

As for the dress, Elise had brought a booklet of designs from the boutique and flipped through them. The design was one thing, but it was the sleeves and skirt that mattered. She picked a dress in the style of that wedding dress, called a hoop skirt.

And bringing the dress you bought in a trunk.

I've been beating myself up, but in the end, I can't let it go to waste.

As I said.

There's no point in rushing to the top if you're not prepared.

If we don't win first place, this whole thing is bullshit.

"......."

"......."

I was now, finally, trying on the dress Elise had bought. That was on my list of priorities.

Something you can wear by yourself.

So, I was now wearing the dress that Elise had bought.

I didn't change her face shape, but I did adjust her height to match her hair and dress length.

To make sure that no one would recognize me, I changed my hair color to silver instead of my usual blonde. I don't want my hair color to be so different that it makes me look different.

Elise looked at me with a lukewarm expression.

"......Say something."

If it's a dog, at least say it's a dog!

"Why in the world would you do this......."

Eleris pursed her lips in embarrassment.

There is no Demon Realm, but a Demon Realm lord is currently having his cross-dressing examined by an underling, and if he doesn't get a psychotic break, that's weird.

"That, but....... This, strangely....... you look good."

Damn!

Don't pat yourself on the back!

"That's the important thing, do you recognize me?"

"What? It's just a change in hair color....... I don't think it's made much of a difference......."

It makes sense. After all, it's the original version and I'm not wearing any makeup, so it's unmistakably me.

"Mirror....... Do you want to see it?"

"......."

Unsightly.

I don't want to look dirty.

"Show me......."

Still, you have to see it.

Eleris summoned a reflective barrier from thin air. I saw myself in the mirror formed by the magic.

Reinhard (silver hair, dress), who seemed to carry all the cares and worries of the world, stared at me.

Rumbles.

Dizzy.

I....... Why would I?

Is this my karma after all?

I think it all started when I played the trick of turning into Sarkegar's ring and being confessed by Kono Lint? Didn't I show him that possibility when he didn't even know it was possible in the first place? Now that I think about it, it's all my fault for turning around and looking at my karma?

It's very sad, but it's not that weird, it's just that Reinhardt makes himself look good when setting up his appearance.

But problem.

I can't help but recognize that it's me from a distance, but up close, I'm the one who knows.

You need to do the following

"That....... will still be....... if I start it?"

Elise carefully laid out the makeup she'd bought in front of me.

Elise said she didn't know how to apply makeup. It was a skill she had no reason to know.

So, she said, she learned how to do makeup with properties while walking around looking at dresses in boutiques.

I don't know how much she learned about makeup in that short time, but I wouldn't worry about it. Elyse is Elyse, so I figured she'd be good at it.

The problem is, it's not her face, it's my face.

I shed the uncomfortable dress once and for all, and sank into a chair.

You've tried on the dress, you don't need to wear it anymore.

The only time I've worn it since then has been to a women's pageant.

"Whoa....... Okay, let's do this."

"For example, ......."

I felt like I was on a death row.



* * *



I'd rather be in a situation where I'm going to Miss Temple. I'd just be a different person altogether, and I think I'd be more comfortable with that.

But this is a cross-dressing contest, and Reinhardt signed up for it in the first place.

I have to accomplish the bizarre goal of looking like a completely different person, while maintaining Reinhardt's appearance as much as possible. In reality, the organizers will keep my identity a secret, but they know it, and they'll think it's weird if someone else shows up.

So I changed the color and length of my hair and called it a wig.

And makeup. Thicker makeup could make you look like a completely different person. The funny thing was, Eleris seemed to be very good at it, considering how quickly she'd learned. Her dexterity wasn't mediocre, but she'd seen it all before.

I could only look at Elise with a dying look on my face.

Importantly, Eleris can't enter the temple.

There are two ways to do this

You can learn how to apply makeup from Eleris, or you can visit her on the day of the competition to get your makeup done and return to the Temple.

They're both like dogs.

"......."

Both Elise and I had the same dying look on our faces.

Elise's eyes are wide as if she has no idea what she's doing, but she's applying makeup to me, and I'm not talking to her.

But as she applied more and more makeup, Elise's expression became more and more grotesque.

What's....... with a look on his face like he wants to know.

"......What's wrong with you?"

"That....... That....... what......."

Eleris's lips quiver.

"You look so good in this......."

"......mirror."

I could see the face with the makeup almost done.

"......damn."

I see.

Too much makeup.

There's a little too much makeup on Elise, but basically the original is fine, so I feel like I can do whatever I want with it.

Then Reinhardt's face isn't even my face in the first place, it's technically just a character customization.

That you can change at will.

I can't even remember what the original version of Valerie looks like now. I mean, technically, it's fine.

I've been on Reinhardt's face longer, so this side feels more like my face.

Anyway.

It's weirdly okay, which makes it even more annoying.

Here's the thing.

"......looks like Reinhardt to me."

"Well, yes....... ."

Reinhardt's face is not intentionally made that way, but I have a strong impression that it is because of his life.

So it's like a real-life version of "What if Reinhardt had been born a girl?".

Even if you don't immediately recognize me, I'm sure anyone who knows me will inevitably say something like, "Isn't that Reinhardt's sister?" or "Does Reinhardt have a sister?".

I imagined Kono Lint asking me to introduce him to my sister.

This is the worst.......

Makeup can only take you so far. You've succeeded in making yourself look good, but you can't hide it.

Now we come to our final task.

"I need to do something about these dirty eyes first."

Ever so subtly, we get into detailed molding. The Ring of Sarkhegar, using its power.

Soften the angry eyes a bit, and make the jawline a bit thinner, not overly noticeable, but just a tiny bit.

Let's put the self-pity aside for now.

I win.

Do whatever it takes to win!

It took me three months of fine-tuning in the mirror.

It feels like you're saving a preset, and you're memorizing this look just like you memorized Reinhardt's look.

By the time I was done, I thought my eyeballs were going to fall out.

"......下载."

"......why."

"Now it's him, unless it's a girl....... I have a strange feeling....... I think I'm at that level....... That, I'll stop."

Just when I thought I was dying of praise, Elise spoke up.

Right.

If a girl doesn't have a face like this....... That's even weirder.......

"But....... The more I look at this, the more I think it's Reinhardt's sister or Reinhardt's brother......."

"For example, ......."

Since you can't touch the big picture, whether you're changing the color of your hair or fine-tuning your face, you're bound to end up being a derivative of Reinhardt.

That doesn't mean you can't reverse them all.

It's like hell. Eleris hesitantly opened her mouth, struggling to speak.

"Degraded....... I think I know what the problem is......."

"What is it?"

"Facial expressions."

Elise pointed to my face in the mirror.

"Facial expressions are the problem."

My expression in the mirror.

I can see the look of death on their faces, and I know they're stressed as hell. You feel like your nerves are on the verge of exploding.

Yes.

This is the facial expression default for the Reinhardt mk.I.

My usual dirty look. I don't have dirty eyes in the first place, I just have a look that makes my eyes look dirty.

But I'm even more stressed about this preparation, so my face is ten times dirtier than usual.

So, right now, I'm about ten times more Reinhardtian than usual.

"Look....... You should try smiling......."

"I'm not in the mood to laugh at ......."

What's not to laugh at in the mirror after this shit?

but that didn't work out.

The corners of my mouth quirked upward.

Forcing a smile was harder than I thought it would be.

Oh, shit, practice smiling in the mirror. What kind of announcer are you?

"Joe, a little more crispness......."

"Working on it......."

You need to put a smile on your face when you're feeling like crap.

It was to die for.

Eleris is right that facial expressions are a problem.

"Apparently....... seems to be working."

All I had to do was change my facial expression, and I looked like a completely different person.

I don't even recognize it.

It's just that I've changed my usual frown to a smiley face.

Eventually, another hour passed, and another, and another, until it was the middle of the night and I was practicing smiling in Eleris' semi-subterranean room.

Finally.

"This is....... It's perfect, it's like a different person altogether."

"Yeah......?"

In the mirror, I saw myself smiling disgustingly, even though my mind had been pulverized into dust and shattered.

I see.

It never looked like Reinhardt.

That's it, you're all set for the pageant.

This is what it's like to have sour water coming out of your stomach. No, it's bitter water coming out of your stomach.

That night, I almost cried in my sleep.

No.......

It was really, kinda, kinda neat.
