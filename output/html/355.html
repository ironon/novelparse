That time.

Ellen was returning to the ecliptic from a break in her home village of Lizaira.

I was curious about the secrets of my hometown, but my parents told me it wasn't time for me to know yet.

However, unlike her brother, Ellen ended up with two holy relics, just like her brother.

Cloak of the Sun God.

I could have returned sooner, but the delay was to familiarize myself with the use of the sun god's cloak.

Before anyone else, Ellen was eager to show Reinhard the Sun God's cloak. She would have one more new holy object for the fight against the demon.

I haven't figured out how to explain the weirdness of my hometown yet. After all, you're explaining something you don't even know.

Reinhard doesn't talk about his secrets, so why can't I talk about mine?

No.

If anything, they'd rather tell you a little bit about their own secrets, even if it means they feel bad about it.

Ellen harbored some vague expectations.

Honestly.

Anything else is probably good.

I've been gone so long, I can't wait to see Reinhard.

I don't know what he's been doing, but he's not lazy, so he's probably been training and keeping himself busy.

Ellen was so eager to get back from Rizaira that she hung herself.

I would have had to practice swordplay with someone else because I wasn't confident enough.

Ellen could think of a couple of people who might be worthy opponents for Reinhardt.

Saviolin Tana, a first-year head teacher.

Or.

"......."

Olivia Ranze, 5th grade.

Thinking that he might be training in swordsmanship with a senior she didn't like, Ellen wished she could come back sooner rather than later, as he was prone to strange behavior.

Ellen stepped through the warp gate in front of the temple and quickly entered the temple entrance.

Maybe they're accusing me of coming too late.

Still, I haven't been gone that long.

Feeling unnecessarily worried and nervous, Ellen took the tram to her royal class dormitory.

Of course, I wasn't training with Olivia.

"If you're Reinhardt, ....... I haven't seen it since yesterday."

This was Klippmann's answer to the question, "Where's Reinhardt?



* * *



No one outside of the family knew that Charlotte, Saviolin Tana, and Reinhardt had gone to the Demon Castle.

It's vacation time, so Reinhardt might be going somewhere, or he might be gone for a few days.

So where did it go.

Ellen didn't mind waiting in her dorm for Reinhardt to return.

Still, I'm a little tired. I can't wait to show Reinhard his new relic and talk to him.

And again.

You are strong, and you have the confidence to be stronger.

You'll get mad when you hear it, but Reinhardt is still weaker than you.

If you want.

I'm sorry to my parents for giving away the town's treasure.

He would rather die than watch Reinhardt die.

Wouldn't it be better for Reinhardt to have the cloak of the sun god.

That's what Ellen thinks to herself.

I can give it to you if you want.

Ellen couldn't wait to see Reinhardt, if only to see the look on his face when he heard that.

Where did Reinhardt go.

I don't think she told anyone where she was going. I wanted to ask Herriot, but he's out of the dorms, too, and a visit to the Magical Research Society reveals that he's now studying magic at the Imperial Palace.

She didn't know what she was doing traveling all the way to the palace to study magic, but she did know that Herriot and Reinhardt weren't together.

If so, click Next.

-Smart

"What the hell, you."

5th grade dorm.

Olivia Ranze opened the door at Ellen's knock and stared at her with a cold expression.

Olivia stares at Ellen, who seems a little different than before.

Normally, he's always smiling, even when he's being a jerk, but now his face was grim.

For a moment, it's hard not to realize that Olivia Lanchester isn't the same person she used to be.

"Reinhard, do you know where he is?"

Ellen wasn't exactly intimidated by Olivia, so she told her what she needed to do.

"Isn't ...... in the dorm?"

"I heard you were gone since yesterday, and I wondered if you knew."

"Chet, you're hanging out without talking to me again."

Olivia let out a rueful grunt, then smirked at Ellen.

"At least I don't feel like an asshole for not knowing."

"......."

Eventually, they'll try to argue, as usual.

Olivia doesn't know Reinhardt's whereabouts either.

Ellen then had no further use for Olivia.

"I don't need to know."

"Uh, fuck off."

-Bang!

Ellen stares at Olivia's harshly closed door.

"......?"

This person.

Whereas before, it felt like you were openly pretending to have a thorn in your side.

Right now, I feel like a hedgehog.

Ellen couldn't help but notice that Olivia wasn't the same.

Ellen thinks as she walks down the hallway of her fifth grade dorm.

Herriot is studying magic at the Imperial Palace.

Olivia is chilling in her room.

No one in the dorm knows where Reinhardt went.

Then there was only one place to go. Unless he'd left the ecliptic altogether, there was only one place for Reinhardt to go.

Rotary Club.

It doesn't matter if it's not there.

I'm also looking forward to playing with the gray-haired lady for the first time in a while.

Ellen exited the dormitory where she had just arrived.



* * *



Basically, Ellen wasn't that interested in other people.

It's changed a little bit since I've gotten to know Reinhard, and as I've gotten friends, I've tried to pay attention to that side of things.

But basically, Ellen is indifferent and unconcerned with what's going on around her. As a result, her attention span is limited.

So, Ellen doesn't really know what a Rotary Club is. It's an organization with a suspiciously strong gray-haired woman as president. That's about it.

I've wondered what the white-haired lady was doing, but I've never dug deeper than that.

A lady who gets angry when you call her ma'am.

It's just that we recognize it.

Except that Reinhardt's secret has something to do with the Rotary Club.

The Rotary Club is associated with a thieves' guild, so Reinhardt and his secret are involved in something like a criminal organization.

I had a rough idea of what to expect.

The white-haired woman would occasionally visit and give herself a good beating, but she hadn't been around much lately.

Ellen left the temple and went to the Rotary Club's new headquarters.

Reinhardt's disappearance led to a love-hate relationship with the Rotary Club.

I do know that things have gotten a lot better since I started opening shops in the Magic Train.

But what lies beneath the surface is the true story of the Rotary Club.

Ellen believes that Reinhardt's secret is connected to a criminal organization, and that the reason the white-haired woman is so suspiciously strong is because she is the head of a shady crime syndicate.

The misunderstanding led Ellen to do something very suspicious.

It's a bad guy, but he's probably someone important to Reinhardt, so let's not wonder.

So Ellen wasn't crossing that line.

Such as the Rotary Club headquarters.

"Hey, it's Reinhardt's girlfriend."

"......?"

The people at the club headquarters had seen Ellen a few times, so when they saw her, they said so.

Girlfriend.

Ellen couldn't help but shake her head at that, but she inclined her head toward the club member who recognized her.

Girlfriend.

Girlfriend.

Girlfriend.

The words echoed strangely in my head.

Then another club member, who was next to the person who referred to herself as Reinhardt's girlfriend, tapped him on the shoulder.

"Uh-huh, man, what is Reinhardt talking about? Reinhardt didn't say anything."

"Oops, is your girlfriend Adriana after all?"

"If you're good enough to leave it to....... I've said enough, haven't I?"

Adriana.

The mention of the name made Ellen shake her head even more.

Why should people in the Rotary Club know about Adriana, a senior who dropped out of Temple?

-Bang!

"Yuck!"

Suddenly, the door burst open and someone ran out.

It was a gray-haired woman.

He jumped up and down, frightened, as if he were running away from something.

Whatever she was doing, her hair was covered in white foam.

-Won't you get over here?! You're not supposed to wash off all the bubbles!

And then there was an angry shout from inside.

"No! I don't want to wash my hair! Why do I have to wash my hair every day!"

-What the hell is that?! Aah! Stay right there!

"I take care of my hygiene......?"

The white-haired woman cried out in horror and stopped talking. Her eyes locked with Ellen's, who was staring back at her from the front of the headquarters.

"Uh....... You?"

And then someone from headquarters came running out.

Somehow, the black dress she's wearing is soaked through.

"......er....... You?"

It was Adriana, a former Temple senior.



* * *



Adriana washed Loyar's hair once and then dragged him back to her to wash his hair again.

Ellen sat still in her boss's office on the top floor of the Rotary Club's headquarters.

Ellen doesn't know why, but she does know that Adriana dropped out of Temple.

We also know that Reinhardt knows Herriot's parents because the dropout issue led Reinhardt to visit the monastery to which Adriana had returned.

I had just heard from Reinhard on the last night of the festival that Adriana's original monastery was in the Duchy of Saint-Thuan.

And that night.

I also saw Olivia Ranze and Adriana return to the Royal Class dormitory in the middle of the night.

We don't know what happened or what has happened since then.

However.

After that, Adriana doesn't go back to the monastery, but instead seems to be living at the headquarters of the Rotary Club.

It doesn't seem like a problem you should care that much about.

A strange sense of dysphoria swirled in Ellen's mind.

Among other things.

The look on Adriana's face when she saw Ellen.

That look of obvious embarrassment.

It was giving me a hunch that Ellen might have some kind of deep secret.

I don't know how much time passed, but Adriana came up to the top floor of the headquarters, dressed in a clean white dress after changing out of her wet clothes.

Adriana was the only one who knew where Mrs. Whitehead was.

Adriana and Ellen weren't the best of friends. Of course, it wasn't as bad as her relationship with Olivia.

A senior who was close to Reinhardt.

No longer in the temple.

It was nothing more than a paternalistic relationship.

"Ah....... Um....... Ellen, right? It's been a while."

Adriana did the same, so she smiled a little awkwardly and sat down across from Ellen.

"Yeah, it's been a while."

You have no right to interrogate Ellen.

However, Adriana came to see Ellen, who was waiting for her, as if she had to face her.

"I didn't realize you were here."

"Oh, umm....... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just happened to......."

Adriana smiles awkwardly.

He's not good at lying, Ellen is sure.

"Reinhardt isn't here, is he?"

Ellen started with the most important reason she was here.

Now I don't know if this is really important or not.

"Yeah, I'm not here. Do you happen to have....... is something wrong?"

At Adriana's worried comment, Ellen shook her head.

"No, I heard you weren't at the temple, so I stopped by to see if you were here. Nothing's going on. Even if you were, ....... I don't know about it."

Not that there was any reason to tell you that.

But Reinhardt was doing things in places she didn't recognize. Adriana's stay at the Rotary Club was most likely Reinhardt's doing.

Even so, Reinhardt is under no obligation to tell him what Adriana's situation is.

But.

Adriana and Olivia returning to the Temple in the middle of the night.

Their frozen expressions.

Reinhardt's reaction, as if he knew something.

What the heck.

What it was.

"May I ask why you're staying here?"

At Ellen's question, Adriana fidgets with her fingertips, squeezing and releasing the hem of her dress.

"That....... had a problem at the monastery where he was staying, and he couldn't stay there. So....... I asked her, Olivia, to help me. So I asked her if she could find a place for Reinhard to stay at....... and she said she could find out where Reinhard was staying....... So I thought I'd post it here....... Yeah. That's how it happened."

Someone who can't stand to lie.

Ellen looked at Adriana and thought about it again.



* * *



There was no Reinhardt in the Rotary Club.

Adriana lied to herself.

Ellen didn't pursue Adriana further, and there was no reason to. Then a gray-haired woman barged in with a towel around her neck and quickly took Adriana away. Something about her needing to play with me.

Ellen returned to her Royal Class dorm.

Reinhardt stepped away for a moment. He's on vacation, which is understandable.

However, Ellen was determined to find out more about this strange occurrence.

Asking Adriana more questions was impossible because of the white-haired woman.

There was one more person to ask.

-Smart

Once again, Ellen came to the fifth grade dorm and knocked on the door.

-Dalcock

"...... Why, what, again. You don't know where Reinhardt is?"

Olivia said, looking nervous as soon as she saw him.

I've been thinking about what to say.

"You were with Adriana the other day."

"......?"

Olivia's already nervous expression hardened at the mention of the name.

"I need to talk to him about something, where is he?"

Olivia stares at Ellen.

"What are you talking about? Let me tell you."

It's more wary than annoyed.

"I just wanted to say it in person."

"......."

Olivia stares at Ellen for a moment, then says, "I don't know.

"I went back to the monastery."

This one's a lie, too.

Ellen confirmed that both Adriana and Olivia were lying to her.

"Really?"

"Yeah. Even if you told me where it was, I'd have a hard time finding it. It's better if you just don't care......."

"The senior. Adriana."

Ellen shakes her head.

"Just now, I'm on my way to meet with the Rotary Club."

"......what?"

At Ellen's point, Olivia's expression hardened even more.

"Senior."

Ellen looks up at Olivia.

Get them to lie to you, get them off the hook.

"Miss Temple contest, why didn't you come?"

Ellen asked the most important question.
