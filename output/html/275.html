            Episode 275.





Charlotte's abilities are currently safe, but we don't know when they will become dangerous.

Also, Saviolin Tana was not in the best shape, but she struggled to cope.

So, just in case, the imperial family dispatched her to deal with Charlotte's outbursts.

That's probably not the only reason why she's staying in the dorms instead of the Spring Palace, but there's another hidden reason.

That's me.

Charlotte stays in the dorm so that I can be available in case of an emergency, but also so that I'm not exposed.

Of course, being a dormitory warden isn't a bad job, but going from being a First Knight of the Empire to suddenly being a temple warden is a weird thing.

1The Emperor's conclusion for the safety of the Empress and to deal with her outbursts.

The knowing side.

Bertus and Charlotte seemed to know this was coming, and I found myself thinking that this was the right move, if a little out of character.

1As important as the role of Knight Commander is, the safety of the Empress is so important that you'll have to put it aside for a while.

-Director Shanafel on......?

-Why?

Everyone who knew about Saviolin Tana was baffled. No one seemed to understand the situation.

If you didn't know any better, you'd think this was some kind of sick April Fool's joke.

Except for Ellen Artorius, who's over there with a stern, "I should have eaten more breakfast" look on her face.

Standing between Mr. Effinghauser and Mr. Mustang, Xavier Tana had removed his Templar livery and was now wearing a two-piece suit.

"Sir is a good enough title. I can also see to your personal training if necessary."

Their eyes lit up at the prospect of being trained by the world's strongest man.

Ludwig, who looked like he didn't know what else to do but to be excited.



* * *



Originally, there was not a prefect for each grade. There are no grade level wardens, and they are on call and patrol.

But Saviolin Tana has a pretty unique position: she's the headmistress of the first grade.

Her interest is obviously in Class B, where Charlotte is, so she doesn't care about Class A as much.

Aside from the new headmaster.

Finals week has begun.

After Monday's integration exam, there was a lot of chatter during the free time.

"Aren't you looking forward to the festival?"

Of course, a guy like Kono Lint seemed to have nothing but festive intentions.

"I heard it was a festival, but what does it do?"

Erich replied.

"It's a beauty pageant!"

......Yes, that's right.

They think that alone adds a lot of value to the festival.

Their formal names are Miss Temple and Mr. Temple.

And there's a cross-dressing contest.

Normally, the final exam is also the final exam, but I'm supposed to be busy practicing for interscholastic competitions, but with the closure of the Orbis class, that's gone.

I know the student government is scrambling to get something done.

With Royal Class, you don't have to do much to prepare, just enjoy the festivities.

"Reinhardt."

"Uh, why."

Kono Lindt even talked to me about how excited he was.

"Aren't you going to the tournament?"

"Tournament?"

"Uh, but....... Aren't you good enough to get in? They're taking applications today?"

Competitive play is gone, but Temple-wide tournaments will be implemented.

There are grade-level tournaments, and there are unlimited grade-level tournaments.

Originally, I wasn't going to participate because I didn't think I had much of a chance of winning first place.



[Won the (Festival) Unlimited Tournament - 15,000 points].

[Won the (festival) 1st grade tournament - 10,000 points].



But the rewards of the challenge are enormous.

The Orbis class has been decommissioned, so it's highly unlikely that they'll be in the field, and even if they are, I've awakened a spirit to enhance their power.

Enchant Self-Suggestion.

It's safe to say that practically no one can beat me at this point, except maybe Ellen. Of course, we have to assume that enchantments will work in a tournament situation.

If my ability is particularly useful in real life, can I use it in tournaments, which are practice matches, not real life?

In Spring Palace, I tried to do it and it worked.

Ellen said she didn't go last time because she thought she was too sure of winning.

A final exam is still a final exam.

I'd like to see the tournament go out eventually.

Aside from the achievement points, winning a tournament can also earn you a trophy and a cash prize from the Emperor.

"Hmm, let's try that."

The three Ganodab brothers look at me.

They've been looking at me in awe for some time now.

Of course, before we could do that, we had to get some answers.

"Hey, Ma."

"?"

I walked over to Ellen in the front row.

"I'm going to the first grade tournament."

"Yes."

"You're not coming out."

"Yes."

Ellen nods coolly.

Is this enough to win?

The way the three Ganodab brothers looked at me changed.

That asshole. He's cheating.

He was like, "No, but if I die and wake up, I can't win. No, but if Ellen comes on, I can die and wake up and still not win?

I don't need second and third place! I have nothing to gain unless I win! The prizes are worth pennies! This variable has to be stopped somehow!

In a nutshell, it knocked a strong contender out of the running.

This is a bit cheating, but.......

Ellen glares at me, and then says, "I'm going to throw it.

"If you don't win, I'm going to yell at you."

"No! Last time, you told me to only go to the quarterfinals!"

"Things have changed."

Apparently, Ellen's standards for me are much higher than they used to be.

The disenchantment was unnecessarily successful, so I took it.......

My declaration of war.

Our strongest rival, the Orbis class, would have been scattered and reassigned to a generic class.

We don't know if they'll come out or not.

But it doesn't change the fact that I'm a strong favorite to win without Ellen.

Before I knew it, it looked like this.

-By the way, isn't there a Miss Temple outgoing in our class?

Cub.

If you're going to yell, yell a little louder so everyone can hear you.

Herriot and Riana cast their 'disdainful' glances at Kono Lint.

You should realize that you're a flesh-eating bastard in a different sense than I am.

"Oh, no! I, I just thought....... I thought you all deserved to get out......."

I said just don't say it. You?

-Bam!

"Reinhardt!"

And.

Suddenly, the door to the first grade classroom burst open and Olivia Ranze appeared.

No, you should be studying during exams, not here." Olivia scurried over to me, not caring that everyone was stunned by her sudden appearance.

Then, he pretended to hold out a piece of paper. I looked at what was written on it and froze.



[Miss Temple Pageant Application].



Apparently, that's what it said.

"My sister, Miss Temple, is going out!"

"......Well, what is it?"

"Of course you're going to take me, right?"

Miss Temple contestant application.

What the hell, man, are you trying to sell me on this?

"Ah, ah, why does it stick whether I leave or not!"

He even grabbed my face and tried to rub it, and I pulled it away in frustration.

No.

The kids' eyes are getting weird again.

Now I'm going to be a dick in the classroom.

That's what it feels like.

When I force her to pull away, Olivia glances around the cheapened classroom.

"Hmmm. I guess I don't have any competition here."

"......."

"......."

"......."

Liana, Ellen, and Harriet's expressions turned bizarre.

I was like, "Why is that thing suddenly arguing?

No, why did you have to come in here and turn off the aggro? Olivia snorted at her classmates, whose faces were rotting from her out-of-line remarks.

Then, suddenly, he stomped off somewhere.

First position.

I was next to Ellen.

"You, you're not coming out?"

At the sudden provocation, Ellen glared at Olivia.

"Why would I leave something like that?"

At Ellen's words, Olivia covers her mouth and looks down at Ellen.

"You think ...... will work?"

"What?"

"You think I'm going to lose if I don't watch?"

No! Why do you always do that to a kid who's standing still!

Leave me alone!

I wanted to smack Olivia Ranze in the back of the head as she smiled. I was about to go over and say something.

An accident happened.

-Bam!

"Yuck!"





Ellen stood up and grabbed Olivia by the scruff of the neck.

The look of horror on the kids' faces washed over me, and so was mine.

Hey, the lid is open.

Ellen grabs Olivia by the scruff of the neck and glares at her with a stern expression.

"I don't know what the hell you're doing to me in the first place, but get lost, I don't want to deal with you."

"This....... You just beat up....... now you're going to beat up......?"

I was about to step in when I realized that Ellen was in trouble.

An anomaly occurred.

-Koooooow!

"!"

"The world....... is wide....... to keep in mind......?"

Olivia grinned broadly and grabbed Ellen's wrist for her slap.

Like it was no effort at all.

Olivia forced Ellen's hands to part as she molded her blow with her vice.

She's the strongest girl in first grade. She is recognized as a freak of nature among us.

Even the older students watched in horror as Ellen was pushed away. Releasing Ellen's hand, Olivia straightened her clothes and smirked.

-Cock!

Olivia nudged Ellen's bewildered forehead with her index finger.

"I know you're confident, but there's always someone better than you, remember?"

"......."

Ellen stared at Olivia, wide-eyed.

"Why, do you want to fight in a no-holds-barred tournament, because I'm pretty sure I can win both, Miss Temple or the tournament?"

Olivia looked at me, leaving Ellen alone with Earl.

-frown

Olivia winked at me and left the classroom.

Ellen stared blankly at the classroom door where Olivia had left. Everyone was looking back and forth between the frozen Ellen and me.

-There was a time when I envied that bastard.......

-She's never going to get disfellowshipped.......

Erich and Kaier muttered in low voices.

Konorint tapped me on the shoulder.

"There....... Come on."

I never thought I'd see the day in my life when I'd be pitied by this asshole.

No matter how strong I am, I'm still no match for Ellen.

And Olivia Ranze, who may be different than that Ellen, but she's definitely stronger.

Everyone seemed to be imagining that I was going to be popped open like a shrimp amongst a bunch of nasty humans.

Anyway.......

Nuna.

Let's see.

I searched.



* * *



After a while.

"I told you to stop grinding your teeth!"

"Me, I'm sorry! Da, I won't do it again!"

I ended up walking up to the fifth grade classroom, had a temper tantrum, and told Olivia off.

"Are you really going to spill it? Are you going to spill it? Do you want me to see it? Do you want me to see it?"

"Reinhardt! I was so mean! Yes! I apologize! Can I apologize to her?"

"It's apples and oranges, just leave the kid alone, you're not going to pay for the night, huh?"

"Yeah, I'll let it go!"

The situation was the same, just in a different grade.

All of the other fifth graders stared blankly as the sneaky junior grabbed the senior like a mouse.

In the end, I had Olivia sobbing and begging for more.

I didn't expect to actually cry, so I panicked a bit.
