            Episode 545.





The earthquake was simply a vibration caused by a giant monster crawling through the ground.

And the giant monster burst forth, devouring vast swaths of land.

-Queueueue!

And so, no matter how fast, no matter how well prepared, the giant Worm, which had devoured the monsters, the soldiers, and Scarlett in an instant, howled with hundreds and thousands of barbed teeth bared from its gaping maw.

Scarlett was devoured.

"No!"

He can't let Scarlett, who just saved his life, die in vain.

I don't know how to deal with that giant monster.

Ludwig grabs his sword and runs toward the giant worm.

Unbeknownst to the other soldiers, Scarlet is capable of enchantment.

We don't know how long we'll last, but we'll be able to survive in the belly of that giant worm, a little longer than others.

Before that.

We need to dismantle that monster before Scarlett runs out of breath.

The sword in his right hand is a toothpick compared to that behemoth.

But he has no choice but to do it. Ludwig runs as a giant worm emerges from the ground, its massive head thrust toward the soldiers, who are horrified by the creature, and devours them.

We don't know how to trim it, but we'll trim it.

I run, determined to get Scarlett out of that gill if I can.

-Quueue!

Ludwig dodges, then stabs his sword at the creature's head.

-Bam!

"Cr......gh!"

It's obviously going in.

Swords don't always cut it.

But too much of a good thing can be overwhelming.

I could poke at it all day and still not break it down.

Can you save Scarlett from being trapped in the belly of this monster?

-Whoosh!

"Ugh!"

The monster raises its head, and Ludwig's body, still clinging to the sword embedded in his chest, floats into thin air.

This monster is shaking off a hanging human with a knife embedded in his body.

This in itself has saved countless lives, as the monster's movement has been contained.

But that's not enough.

A little more.

You'll need to slice and dice through this hide to get to the scarlet.

Ludwig's eyes fill with blood.

-Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!

I can't do it, but I'll do it while I can.

Ludwig gritted his teeth and stabbed his sword through the air.

If it was a master class.

If only it were stronger.

Ludwig gritted his teeth and swung his sword to save Scarlett's life before it was snuffed out, but it wasn't enough.

The truth is always devastating.

What you can't do, you can't do.

-Woof!

"Boom!"

Guisu deliberately slams his head on the ground, shaking Ludwig off.

-Queueueue!

Then he roars at Ludwig, who has spun around.

It's like he's going to swallow the one bug that's been bothering him.

That moment when the monster's hideous gills spill out.

-Tuk-Tuk!

-Ke-e-e-e-e!

A huge spear of ice flew out of nowhere and stuck into the worm's gills, jerking it backward.

-Bang! Quack!

With that, a slew of offensive spells begin to fly out of nowhere, hitting the creature squarely in the gills.

It's a hopeless battle, but you're not alone.

Wizards, who have been watching the situation from the rear, provide magical support when a monster appears that requires urgent action.

-Queueueue!

The worm becomes a mop in real time.

Humans are not weak.

The power that humans have scraped together is not weak.

Humanity's last army is the strongest because it is the last.

And.

"Move over, Ludwig!"

Ludwig heard Delphine Izdra's voice above the screaming monsters.

When I turned around, there was Delphine, with a protest hanging from her one-handed bow.

Just as a sword is a toothpick in the face of that behemoth, so too is Delphine's arrow a toothpick.

But it's not just an arrow.

Having awakened to the rare power of Elementalism, Delphine Izadra's arrows are anything but ordinary.

-Woof!

Delphine's arrow, condensed with wind, emitted a grotesque wail.

A wind so condensed that space seems distorted, an arrow so imbued with elemental power, and the moment it is fired.

-Two bangs!

With an explosive roar, the arrow shot into the worm.

-Bam!

Ludwig watched, wide-eyed, as the shockwave created by the release of the enormous wind force compressed in the arrow ripped the monster's gills right off.

In the midst of the spray of flesh and monster blood, Ludwig saw Scarlett, her whole body covered in monster blood.

Alive.

Scarlett, who has been protected by a blue energy shield, falls to the front of the battlefield.

The other soldiers who were swallowed are already torn apart, but Scarlett is unharmed.

But he was unconscious.

An enchanted blue shield protected Scarlett, but it was fading.

Even more unfortunate, Scarlet landed not on the Allied side, where the soldiers were, but in the direction of the monsters, as if bouncing off them.

"No!"

Supporting fire from the mages and Delphine's power allows Scarlett to escape the creature's body, but at this rate, she will be torn apart by the onrushing monsters.

We were under siege.

Scarlett, unarmed and abandoned in the midst of the monsters, lay motionless as they swarmed her from all sides.

Ludwig runs.

"Ludwig! No!"

Delphine shrieked as she realized Ludwig was about to make a reckless lunge.

But Ludwig runs, pulling the dead soldier's spear from the ground.

You can't take on giant monsters, but you can kill what you can kill.

-Thump! Quack!

Ludwig opens the way, charging like a chariot with his human body.

Stabbing with spears, punching, and kicking.

Run toward the waves of monsters that are closing in on Scarlett.

Too many people die because of a momentary lapse in judgment, a moment of injustice, a moment of injustice.

Ludwig gritted his teeth, picked up the weapons of the dead, wielded them, discarded them when they broke, took up new ones, and charged.

Delphine thinks she can't stop Ludwig, too, and opens up with a barrage of flame, thunderbolts, and wind-laden arrows.

If Scarlett is swallowed by a wave of monsters, there is no next.

"Turn off......!"

The wizards' backup support is probably going to go elsewhere, so hoping for their help is like hoping for luck.

You can't hope for luck on a battlefield where there's more bad luck than good, so Ludwig runs through waves of monsters.

-Quack!

No matter how much Delphine pierces the monsters with her spirit-powered arrows, other monsters fill the void.

Stabbing, slicing, and dicing, Ludwig eventually reaches the fallen Scarlett and picks her up.

But there's more to it than just picking up Scarlett.

The only way to survive is to get out of this hellhole.

Obviously, you can't protect against every attack.

Ludwig's only free hand is his right, as Scarlett has been picked up.

-Puck! Kwazik!

-Queueueue!

-keeeeeeek!

"Eek......!"

Your pace is naturally slower than when you're alone, and you're not as free to attack.

Your mages are supporting elsewhere, and your soldiers can barely handle the monsters in front of them.

-Bang! Quack!

The only thing that helps is the arrow that Delphine shoots as she approaches to save Ludwig and Scarlett.

Without it, he would have been swept away by the monsters and buried with Scarlett.

Under supporting fire, Ludwig takes it one step at a time, kicking and stomping his way through the oncoming monsters, trying to stay out of their midst.

But in the end, Ludwig has a square.

And while some monsters are overly large, others are not, and they are bound to be less visible.

We're almost out of the wave of monsters.

Ludwig saw a small snake slithering toward him from the side too late.

Small snake.

Ludwig was a little late to the party, but that doesn't mean he didn't react.

"......!"

-Bam!

Just as the little snake was about to bite him, Ludwig grabbed it with his right hand.

Not the head, though, but something a little further away.

A snake will bite if it can't get a hold of your head.

"Oops!"

-Bam!

Just because it's small doesn't mean the attack is any less devastating.

The small snake's sharp teeth pierced through Ludwig's magical enhancements.

And.

"Eek!"

Ludwig couldn't help but groan at the intense foreign sensation of something pushing through the gaping wound and the burning pain of his nerves.

"Ludwig!"

Delphine's complexion turned blue as she watched from afar as Ludwig was bitten by the snake.

"Eek!"

-Woof!

Ludwig swung his right hand a few times like a whip at the door snake, and it soon slithered away, but the wounds from the bite were already evident.

"Off......aah!"

Even Ludwig screamed in agony at the pain of the teeth that dug into his grip and the venom that burrowed through them.

But you can't stop walking.

-Two bangs!

Once again, Delphine's arrows pierce the waves of monsters swarming toward Ludwig and Scarlett.

In the distance, Delphine watched Ludwig with an arrow in her hand.

-Run away!

Delphine's urgent cry.

Ludwig takes each step with his left hand, supporting Scarlett, while enduring the burning pain in his right hand.

The wound on his right hand and the disoriented Scarlett believing that once he got to the rear, things would work out.

-Kwazik! Bam!

Ludwig fights his way through the waves of monsters, trying to ignore the graying areas in real time.

The venom of the small snake was clearly having a devastating effect on Ludwig's body.

The arm is probably good.

Instead, we need to keep Scarlet alive.

If you fall here, if you collapse from the pain, Scarlett will die.

Ludwig gritted his teeth, stomping on the monsters with his feet rather than his uncooperative right hand, running toward the path cleared by Delphine's supporting fire, and soon he was out of the middle of the horde.

"Ludwig, are you okay?!"

The Delphin's primary role is to provide ranged support, including Elementalism, from the rear.

But when he saw that Ludwig and Scarlett were in danger, he went deep into the battlefield.

"I'm, I'm fine, I'll get Scarlett to....... faster than me"

"No! Your hand feels weird right now......!"

-Whoosh...

Delphi is too.

Too much.

We're in the deep end.

Suddenly, Ludwig and Delphine felt the sky darken.

The behemoth was already leaping toward them.

"Ludwig! Du......!"

But Ludwig wasn't the one the creature was after.

Leaping over Ludwig, he recognizes a more dangerous presence and attacks.

-Bam!

"Phew!"

Ludwig saw waves of monsters, a giant wolf with hundreds of eyes that leaped over his head and bit Delphine's shoulder blade.

The blue magic that enveloped Delphine's body was crushed, and the wolf's massive teeth sank in.

-No support!

"Del...... pin?"

Delphine's body is crushed by the wolf's teeth.

Ludwig could only watch in disbelief as the death took place in an instant.

-disconnect.......

Delphine Isadra, blood spurting from her mouth, speaks with only the shape of her mouth and the last of her strength.

No elemental power, no Ludwig, no nothing.

In the heat of the moment, I was unable to stop the rush of the great monster.

It was a moment.

It was only for a moment.

But it was a moment that took Delphine Izadra's life far too easily.
