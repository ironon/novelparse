            Episode 405.





There were plenty of people who followed me, but there were also plenty of people who didn't need to.

Most of them thought that if they could get past me, the next great warrior, they could get a piece of my popularity.

Otherwise, it seemed like some guys were following me around trying to hit on me because I had a girl they liked.

It had become a routine to travel around with a fan club and get into fights here and there. Ellen and Harriet were still on the sidelines.

Herriot seemed to be crying to himself.

I always had my hat pressed down over my puffy eyes.

I know I've been to dangerous places, just as Ellen has, and I know I will continue to do so.

I couldn't stop her, and I couldn't watch her, and she seemed to struggle.

Olivia was away from her dorm often.

She was assigned to be an Inquisitor for the Crusade. She was practically past the age of graduation, and since she would receive class credit for her outside activities alone, the Royal Class dormitory was now little more than a place to sleep.

Ellen and Harriet were depressed, and Olivia was trying to make a name for herself so that the devil would come after her, which was never going to make me feel better.

Stress here, stress there.

And.

When stress builds up too much.

My hair is falling out.

"Oh....... Xbal......."

At night, just before I fell asleep, I took a shower and froze at the sight of the damp blonde on my hands.

When I picked up my hair, I noticed a circular bald spot.

A common malapropism.

It was the size of a dime, and it was making its presence felt.

I didn't want to be reunited with this shit.

Why are you in my life again?

I thought we were supposed to break up for good.

"Whoa, whoa....... Whoa......."

Focus your mind. The circular bun was filled with hair in real time.

Hair Loss Permanent Immunity Ring.

The Ring of Dreadfind saved my life.

I am God!

God of hair loss!

Or should I say god of hair, because if he's a god of baldness, he's probably a god of hair loss.

I am God!

Lord of the hair! God of the hair!

Go ahead and dive in, I'll fill you up again!

For a moment, PTSD set in, but the Ring of Dreadfind saved me.

It's bad enough to be stressed out, but when you lose your hair, it's not doubly depressing, it's squared. It is neither added nor multiplied, but squared.

Without this ring.

It wouldn't have been able to enter the temple in the first place.

Without the ability to recover hair, I.

I thought I was going to make a name for myself as the first bald warrior in history.

Thanks Sarkegar.

You're a loyalist.

-TalkTalkTalk

And to my horror, when I returned to my room, a sparrow was tapping on my night window with its beak.

-Drupa!

I opened the window and a sparrow flew into the gun room, and when I drew the curtains, Sarkegar transformed into her usual dainty maid form as if she had been waiting.

"See you at the degradation......."

"I love you."

-Wrong!

"????"

Sarkegar flinched in embarrassment as I suddenly pulled him into a hug.

"You're the loyalist of the century, the one who will go down in history!"

Thanks for saving my hair!

No loyalist in the world has ever cured their lord of baldness!

"Yes......? Yes, I love you too, Jaehaeaaaah!"

Sarkegar didn't understand English, but he knew he had to do something, so he grabbed me and patted me on the back.



* * *



Sarkegar was there for my own reasons, but he was probably curious about my sudden behavior, so I explained why.

"......Do you mean your hair is falling out?"

"......Yes."

Unlike me, who thinks hair is a big deal, Sarkegaard, a shapeshifter, just doesn't get it.

"Regardless, it's a great honor to know that the Ring of the Clan has solved the problem of degradation."

"No, I'm honored."

I was about to bow, which made Sarkegar even more puzzled.

"I'm here to tell you about my contact with Owen de Getmora, as per your earlier instructions......."

"Oh, right. That."

Sarkeghar stood somewhat stiffly and began to pull out the package.

"The Imperials seem to have taken us at our word for now, but there's every chance they won't believe us."

"So would ......."

It is entirely possible that the Imperials believe the last raid on Raziern was retaliatory. We can talk in private, but we're still enemies, and that can't be helped.

"We need to find the cultists before the Empire does."

"I guess so."

The race is on.

If you find the cultists later than the Empire, they die.

If I find them first, I can put them under my feet.

I'll have to think about whether or not I need to keep them under my feet, but for now, there's absolutely no reason to let the pagans run amok like this.

We'll save it for later, but for now, we need to make contact with the Demons to keep them from going on a rampage.

"I've been gathering my own information, and it seems that the Empire is estimating the point of origin of the demonic religion to be in the southern part of the continent."

Sarkegar said, looking cautiously to see if he had done any research. Sarkegar was a messenger, but as an imperial noble, he had unrestricted access to imperial information.

Of course, that goes for me too.

Continent South.

Of course, since the unit is a continent, the number of countries and territories that fall under the single word "overly southern" is almost unfathomable.

South.

"If you're in the South, the only thing you know is Friday's gazoo."

Galarsh, I'm told, is based in a place called the Gelkorgis Desert in the southern part of the continent.

Of course, there's a very real possibility that we won't be able to get valid information due to the sheer size of the project, but for now, focusing on Galarsh was the best we could do.

"I'll leave it to Rusinil to get your thoughts to the council."

"Yes, degradation."

I watch as Sarkegar, once again transformed into a sparrow, flies out the window.

Empire first or us first.

While Sarkegar has access to information from the imperial court, I'm better at this.

I am a warrior.

You can get to the information the Empire has gathered much faster than Sarkhegar can by taking many different routes.

If you get your hands on the cultists, do you dispose of them or use them?

I'd have to think about that as well.

After that day of talk of engagement, Ellen stopped eating with Reinhardt in the middle of the night at restaurants.

It wasn't even a big fight.

It's not like we were seriously talking about calling it quits.

However.

Ever since she'd heard those words, it was as if they weren't supposed to do anything together. Outside of Tana's swordsmanship classes, Ellen and Reinhardt only glanced at each other when they passed each other.

But facial expressions.

The look on Reinhardt's face whenever he sees her is unbearable for Ellen.

If you care so much about Charlotte that you get engaged to her, and later married to her, to protect her. If you think that's good enough for you, I'd rather turn away.

The guilty glint in her eyes when she looks at herself haunts Ellen.

You'd think we'd be done here.

Because of the look in his eyes, she can't think that it's over. They don't act and treat each other as if they don't exist, but this feeling of being less than, well, less than, is what's hurting Ellen.

So.

Ellen sits in a diner in a daze.

Not eating or doing anything.

It's been a while since I've even felt hungry. By this time, I'm starving and need to eat something.

Sitting idly in a restaurant, waiting for someone who never comes.

Ellen didn't drink a drop of water.

I know Reinhardt isn't coming, but I can't sleep.

If you're outside, you might catch a glimpse of Reinhardt coming and going, but if you're in a room, that's not even a possibility.

Ellen in the lobby, in the dining room, on the stage.

I've had a lot of idle time.

If I ever come across it, I'll ask what it means.

Because it's all good.

Because I get it.

I want things to be the way they used to be.

I'm not going to feel like I want you all to myself.

As always, let's talk, cross swords, and maybe eat together sometime.

That's enough for me. If you and Charlotte get engaged, and beyond that, married, that's fine.

I thought we could be friends.

But.

Using that as an excuse to stay with Reinhardt is itself a sign that they can't be friends.

I was afraid that if I said anything, I would make the same mistake with Reinhard that I had made with my brother.

You said you liked me.

It was all a lie, and to let it go like this, so easily.

Was he playing with me? Why did you do that to me?

If Reinhardt were to die after saying that.

Fearing that she would never be able to take back what she had said, Ellen said nothing to Reinhard, afraid that she would hurt him with her words and not be able to take them back.

So Ellen wanted to talk to him, but she couldn't; she wanted to grab him and talk to him, but she couldn't.

Just as Reinhard tries to say something, but can't, so does Ellen.

It is already known that Reinhardt is the master of Alsbringer. Word has spread within the Temple, and the Royal Class dormitories are often crowded with Common Class students hoping to catch a glimpse of Reinhardt.

Ellen knows that this fame will one day be the knife that stabs Reinhardt in the back.

I want to do something, but I can't do anything.

You can't get involved in Charlotte and Reinhard's problems. She wants to help Reinhardt in his dangerous endeavors, but she knows he won't want to, so she can't even ask him to go with her.

So Ellen just sat there, dumbfounded.

Not knowing what to do or how to do it, just hoping to stumble upon it.

It was past his bedtime, and he knew Reinhardt wouldn't come out of his room, so he just sat around in the lobby and dining room.

Reinhardt didn't show up at the restaurant.

In her self-destructive malaise, Ellen thinks to herself.

All you can do is think about it.

All of this is happening because of one thing: Charlotte's life is in danger.

No engagement, no Reinhardt being in danger.

He wants to ensure Charlotte's safety at the expense of his own.

While it is known that Reinhardt is the owner of Alsbringer, the engagement is not yet public knowledge.

If Reinhardt is making a reluctant choice, then Charlotte's safety could mean that Reinhardt's engagement is off.

If it does.

I wonder if I should be next to Reinhardt again.

"......."

If so, how.

On that unforgettable night in Kamsenka, Ellen and Herriot listened to Reinhardt's explanation.

We don't know why, but Charlotte has lost the race to the throne, so her life is in danger, and she can't guarantee her safety unless she marries someone with a stronger cause than Reinhard.

How to make Charlotte safe.

Can I do that?

Ellen looks out the window of the restaurant and contemplates.

Be still and think about your name.

Ellen.

Ellen, Artorius.

"......."

Ellen stood up from her seat.



* * *



-Smart

Late at night.

At the sound of the knock on her door, Charlotte jumped out of bed in her pajamas. It wasn't uncommon for Tana to come check on her in the middle of the night if she was worried.

"Lord Tana, you must be tired, go to sleep......."

-delay

So when Charlotte walked in the door, unsuspecting, she was stunned to see someone she didn't expect.

"ah......."

Ellen Artorius came to Charlotte in the middle of the night.

"Can I talk to....... with you?"

At Ellen's cautious words, Charlotte held still and looked into Ellen's eyes.

The desperation in his eyes was too much for Charlotte to resist.



* * *



It's way past your bedtime.

Charlotte was in her pajamas and a coat, and Ellen was in her sweatpants, sitting across from each other on the terrace.

Charlotte was feeling guilty about Reinhardt.

And I had similar feelings for Ellen, if not more so than I did for Reinhard.

"Do you have anything to say?"

"......."

Ellen stares down at the table.

I don't want Reinhardt to be in danger.

Just as Olivia took on some of Reinhardt's risks, Ellen thinks she wants to do the same.

The world will focus more on Lagan Artorius' sister than on Reinhard and Olivia. It's a risky business.

That's something she can live with.

But how.

I hope he can make Reinhardt's inevitable engagement a non-event.

Charlotte de Gradias is losing ground.

So, we just need to get Charlotte's position right.

Ellen opens her mouth to speak.

"I'll be your knight."

"Huh? What....... What?"

It was so unexpected that Charlotte had no idea what she was hearing.

"If I become your knight, that alone will keep you safe."

Ellen Artorius.

Knowing the weight of the name, Charlotte couldn't help but panic.

Ellen didn't say anything more.

Instead of becoming the bride of Reinhard, Champion of Alth, Ellen Artorius, sister of Ragan Artorius, has chosen to make him her lord.

I didn't need to hear the backhanded way of saying, "Why don't you just do something you're not engaged to do.

Ellen bows to Charlotte.

"I will do many things for you. Anything for the Empire. I'll do everything. You can use me to do anything, and my balls will soon be your balls......."

Ellen pleads, her voice bitter.

"I won't say it's because I don't want you and Reinhard to be engaged. But Reinhardt will be in more danger. I'd rather be in danger. I'm everything. If there's anything Reinhardt needs to do, I'll do it........"

"......."

I can give you everything I have, but please don't take just one, the hero's sister asks the empress.

I see Ellen Artorius making these decisions because she doesn't want to lose Reinhardt.

Around this time last year.

Charlotte had seen the relationship between Herriot de Saint-Antoine and Ellen Artorius and pitied them.

I kept silent, thinking my words would destroy their relationship.

But now.

Charlotte found herself in the same position.

I became a taker, but I wasn't happy about it.

But now.

Watching Ellen make these choices because she didn't want to be deprived was not a pleasant experience.

If you decline.

If they are on equal footing.

Reinhardt knows who to choose.

As much as Charlotte didn't like her current situation, she certainly didn't like seeing Ellen's desperate expression.

"If they say no, what will you do?"

"......."

If she wants to be a knight, it's her choice to accept it or not.

If you grit your teeth and refuse, Reinhardt will betroth you to him.

If you look away from those desperate eyes.

"Please....... Please......."

If you turn away from those tears.

"Like this...... to....... Please......."

Maybe we can look forward to an even bigger future.

But Charlotte knows.

He himself was defeated by Bertus.

It doesn't matter if she's a knight, or a maiden married to a knight, as long as she knows that the demon's spirit resides within her.

We're at the mercy of Bertus.

You are always Reinhardt's burden.

I'd rather have a knight and his lord than a husband and wife relationship.

"Yes, be my article."

I smiled at Ellen.

"Instead."

Looking at Ellen, Charlotte smiles.

"This is the first and last concession."

You can't settle for a cowardly victory, so you want to win for real.

This is not a waiver.

You decide to cancel the unfair race and start together this time.

A knight who has no loyalty to his lord.

A lord jealous of his knight.

A strange pledge of allegiance, just beginning.
