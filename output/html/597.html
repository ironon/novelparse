            Episode 597.





It was a clubhouse that had been completely converted into a Dettomorian hideout since the Temple ceased operations.

As they entered the underground space, everyone but Ellen was stunned.

"What is this......?"

Ludwig.

"Crazy, isn't that blood?"

Heinrich.

"What is this, what is this all about?"

Louise.

All three felt a sense of dread as they entered a space filled with unidentified shamans and symbols.

Regardless of one's personal strength and experience, it's easy to feel an unexplained sense of dread when faced with this sight for the first time. In fact, Ellen was freaked out the first time she came to this place.

"Are you sure we can come to....... right?"

In fact, even Ludwig, who was a much-misunderstood but actually good friend of Dettomorian, said so with a white face.

In many ways, Detomorians deserve special treatment.

Ludwig has seen civilians killed by guards for praying to strange idols.

But the sight of all the idols and shamanic circles in this basement, even priests who have never harmed another human being in their lives, under the guise of embracing and edifying pagans, might wonder if they should be the first to hang a Detomorian at the stake.

For being a student of the Temple, and a royal student at that, Dettomorian was able to get away with setting up a scene that deserved to be called the heretic of heretics.

Obviously, civilians who knew nothing about the heresy would see this and assume it was the work of a pagan.

Passing by ominous and bizarre sights, everyone is feeling uneasy.

"It's okay."

Ellen, being a seasoned traveler, was not afraid to go underground.



* * *



The heart and soul of the shaman.

Arriving in the cellar-like space, Ellen could see that Detomorian was still sitting in the center of the circle.

Aside from the quaint, ominous vibe, it's a messy space to begin with.

Therefore, Ellen has no way of knowing if Detomorian is still wishing for the same thing.

I can't tell if the idols have been rearranged or the shamanic circle has been redrawn. It was crowded before.

However.

"You're here."

"Yes."

Detomorian said as he looked at the four who had suddenly arrived.

The word itself is already ambiguous.

Does it mean you knew it was coming or that it's just now coming.

The Dettomorian speaks in a way that is not easily understood by the listener, and whose intentions are unknown.

Ellen isn't very close to Detomorian either, and Ludwig tries to be, but can't.

Heinrich and Louise are frozen in place.

Ruiz isn't going anywhere, and Heinrich isn't going anywhere.

But there's something about the scene itself that overwhelms people.

"Did you think we were coming?"

In response to Ellen's question, Detomorian stares at the candle lit in front of him, which continues to emit a faint light.

"Well......."

Again, a vague answer.

Ellen approached the Dettomorian fearlessly, and sat down in front of the candle.

A warrior and a shaman sit across from each other with a single candle between them.

"Are you still praying for peace these days?"

"No......."

Detomorian was praying for peace until Ellen, Bertus, and Tana arrived.

"Then what are you doing?"

In response to Ellen's question, Dettomorian says.

"All is well."

"And peace."

Safe and sound.

Ellen shakes her head at that.

"I was praying for your soul's safety and peace."

"...... me?"

"Yeah."

The Dettomorian says still.

"Because that's the same word as peace."

Ellen still can't understand what the Dettomorian is saying.

But in the midst of this bizarre spectacle, it's hard not to feel a shiver run down your spine when you hear a shaman performing an unidentified ritual and saying a prayer for you.

"I see."

But Ellen looks at the Dettomorian and dips her head slightly.

"Thanks."

Say thank you.

"......."

Just like Ludwig did.

Ellen knows that the Detomorian is not evil.

It's still the same.

We don't know the outcome of the spell, and we don't know if it works. We don't know if the symbol the Dettomorian gave her really protects Ellen, and even if the Dettomorian is praying for Ellen's soul next to peace, we don't know if it will work.

But Ellen is grateful to Dettomorian because she knows his prayers are genuine.

After thanking the Dettomorian, Ellen cautiously raised her head.

Detomorian looks at Ellen with an expression that makes it impossible to tell what he knows and what he doesn't.

Detomorian, which is already extraordinary in a not-so-good way, seems even more extraordinary in this space.

If it normally looks dreary, in this dark and dreary space, the Detomorian feels like something that no word can really describe.

I wonder if we're in the wrong place.

You've been following a case and accidentally stepped into a place you shouldn't have.

The same thought was inevitably on everyone's mind.

But Ellen looks at the Dettomorian and says nothing.

"There's a cemetery in the basement of the Great Hall of the Crusader Knights."

"......."

Despite the blunt start, Dettomorian stays still and listens to Ellen.

"It's a cemetery where priests and paladins are buried who had powerful divine powers in their lifetime."

To cut to the chase.

It's too long a story to tell from the beginning, so I'll just ask what needs to be asked.

"I think someone has reanimated the remains in that cemetery and taken them somewhere."

"......."

"Is that even possible?"

As she spoke, it occurred to Ellen that the question itself might be rude.

It would be rude to assume that a Dettomorian would know the evil arts of creating the undead, and to come here to ask.

But in response to Ellen's simple but not lighthearted question, Dettomorian is silent.

However, Dettomorian's answer is not a yes or no.

"Don't."

"......?"

"Better not......."

Another word for it.

But since it was completely unintelligible, Ellen thought she had a clue.

What Detomorian is talking about.

"Do you think it's....... good?"

"Yes......."

It would have told me to sweep it under the rug and not dig into it.

"Can you elaborate on that?"

"No......."

I don't know if it's that I can't explain it, or that I can't understand it, or that I can't tell you. Unintelligible.

Everyone listened to Ellen and Detomorian's bizarre preamble.

That look that feels like a conversation, but doesn't feel like one at all.

Between them, Ludwig steps forward.

"Detto."

"......."

Ludwig sits down next to Ellen.

"Do you know something? Tell me if you do."

"......."

"I don't know, the priest I was trying to help was actually a really bad person, and I don't know what he was trying to do with me, and now I want to know what he did and how bad he did it....... I want to know what the hell happened and what's going to happen next......."

"You're going to die......."

"......?"

The Dettomorian's words puzzled Ludwig, as well as Ellen, Louise, and Heinrich, who listened in silence.

The Dettomorian speaks slowly, still looking at Ludwig with a sullen expression.

"Ludwig, you're going to die if you go any further."

At the sudden prophecy. Ludwig's complexion turned white.

"Do nothing......."

Although we don't know anything else.

Ellen and Ludwig could tell that Detomorian was genuinely worried about Ludwig.



* * *



Sudden prophecy.

It's deceptively simple.

Death.

And the prophecy was directed at Ludwig.

Ludwig was stunned into silence, his mouth hardening into a stone.

Ellen was puzzled, too.

"What do you mean, all of a sudden Ludwig is like that?"

"......."

Ludwig wasn't going to argue, nor was he angry.

Ludwig is not the kind of person to do that to a friend in the first place.

"If you tell me anything, I'm going to....... if you say something?"

Ellen asked on behalf of Ludwig, who couldn't think of anything to ask.

Why are you saying that, and if you saw something, what did you see?

"I can't convince you and....... I can't explain......."

The Dettomorian only says that. He doesn't say that he doesn't understand what he sees, or that he doesn't know why he knows this.

Ellen was Ellen, Ludwig was Ludwig, and the sullen-looking Detomorian could ask no more.

"You have to say something, don't you? Suddenly. What if he dies suddenly and you don't say anything!"

"It's the youngest......!"

Thus, Heinrich, who had been watching the scene from behind, stepped forward, looked down at the Dettomorian, and snarled.

Louise panicked as she watched her son walk out of the room with something tingling and ominous about him, and she gingerly grabbed Heinrich's shoulder.

Detomorian stares up at Heinrich, unmoving.

A piercing gaze.

And a quick glance at a nervous Louise in the back.

"......!"

In that brief stare, Heinrich felt an eerie sensation that made the hairs on his back stand on end.

A gaze that seems to know what truths are hidden, even if it's only for a moment.

Heinrich's gaze sent a cold sweat down his spine, and Louise felt her breath catch in her throat.

Heinrich had a gut feeling that he shouldn't mess with Detomorian.

"Detomorian."

"Yes......."

However, Ellen, who believes in Detomorian, calls him out.

"If we don't get a proper explanation of why this is a dangerous job, why Ludwig is going to die, why it's better not to know....... I, we have no choice but to try to find out more about this job."

"......."

"It's not that I don't believe you, but there's so much at stake in this, I don't think I can let it go."

"That's right......."

Dettomorian nods in agreement, as if Ellen is right.

"I mean small....... Small and low, with little evidence, little credibility, insufficient explanation, and little appeal......."

It's been a while since we've had a Detomorian.

No, almost the first time.

Don't drag or stutter.

"I speak what I see."

"Don't say what you haven't seen."

"But, of course."

"What I say doesn't always come true."

"Maybe what I said was just a bunch of bullshit."

"But in an age where death is rampant. It's not a hard prophecy to make."

"Everyone dies at some point."

"Anyone can die at any time."

"Now that death is as common as hunger and poverty everywhere."

"Anyone's death is bound to look easy."

"Rather than divining mediocre fates. It's easier."

"So."

"I'm not always right."

"What I see doesn't necessarily happen."

"This time."

"You must be right."

"Ludwig."

"Do nothing."

"You're going to die."

It's a world where death is too prevalent.

So it's easier to see death than to see anyone's fate.

So it must be true.

Ludwig has no idea why this has anything to do with his death, and neither does anyone else.

On their way to inquire about witchcraft and pagan rituals, they hear a death prophecy that is completely out of character.

Ludwig stares at the Dettomorian, stunned.

If I'm talking about Ludwig's death, it's because I don't want him to die.

"Let me ask you a question."

After a long moment of silence, Ludwig speaks up with a stern expression.

"Am I going to die for nothing?"

"......."

"I can't do anything, I can't do anything in my own strength. I can't get help, I can't get help, I can't get help, I can't get help, I can't get help, I can't get help, I can't get help, I can't get help, I can't get help. I can't be of any help, and that's how......."

Ludwig says, looking miserable.

"Is that how you die?"

Ludwig asks, but Dettomorian is silent.

"......."

No answer.

But this time, the silence feels different. Everyone feels the difference.

We don't know what this silence means, but it's a deliberate silence.

because you know what's going to happen when you say it.

You'll die.

It's not a pointless death.

Detomorians don't speak.

A shaman speaks what he sees. He does not speak of what he has not seen.

For a shaman who cannot lie, the only lie is not telling the truth.

"That's not it."

"......."

"Detto, right?"

Detomorian says nothing.

"That's it."

You don't die meaninglessly and in vain.

We don't know what's going on, but the fact that death is in sight is already a hint that we can do something about it.

Rather, I read hope that something can be done.

Even if death awaits, even if that statement is absolute.

There is hope that it might not be absolute after all.

Being able to do something was something Ludwig hadn't been able to do since the death of Delphine Izdra, since he lost his arm.

After a long silence, the Detomorian finally bows his head.

"Destiny is fulfilled by those who will change it."

Once upon a time. Someone.

"Like I tried to change my destiny and ended up like this."

As if you wished for it, and then you got it.

"Me too....... as well."

Detomorian sees the future now, but he intuits that he has completed it because he tried to change it.

The words that were meant to stop Ludwig's death actually propelled him forward.

The future was known, but not the people.

He realizes that he has, in fact, left Ludwig behind.

"Me too, I can't get out of that shackle......."

No one knows what a Detomorian is talking about.

But I could read the self-doubt and frustration in his words.

The silent Detomorian soon looked up.

"Find Ashur."

"......?"

We were all taken aback by this out-of-the-blue statement.

"Then, you'll know."

Existence that has no reason to be mentioned in this context.

A friend who is already dead.

What the hell does finding someone who can't come back have to do with this?

"What do you mean, find Ashur?"

"You! You keep saying things I can't understand. What are you trying to say?"

When Ludwig panics, and Heinrich finally lets his old temper creep in.

"Get out."

Detomorian's face is grim as he issues his congratulations.

"More like this. I wouldn't change a thing."

The shaman was already beginning to fear for his own mouth.

Now Nagara could ask no more questions in the face of that determined demeanor and the desperate look on the shaman's face.



* * *



The Detomorian may speak unintelligibly, but he's not a harsh person at all.

So telling the visitors to leave was almost the first time I'd ever spoken to someone in a command tone as a Dettomorian.

It doesn't matter who's listening.

Everyone heard shocking, incomprehensible, unintelligible words, and words whose intentions were hard to guess.

In the cellar of the lone fraternity house, lit by a few candles, Detomorian sat still.

With an attitude that makes it impossible to tell if you're praying for something, contemplating something, or doing nothing.

Into that silence, that candle-burning silence.

A small, soundless figure slowly approaches.

-Angel

"......."

Black cat.

Detomorian didn't even look in the direction of the cat.

The cat walks over and sits still across from the Dettomorian.

The first time she cried, the cat just stared at the Dettomorian.

The cat says nothing, and the shaman says nothing.

There is a long silence.

One hour.

Or two hours.

After a long silence, unknown how long, between the cat and the shaman.

"All I could do was this......."

The shaman opens his mouth slowly.

"To get you closer to something less dangerous, rather than something more dangerous......."

The cat listened to the shaman's apologetic words, but didn't react.

"But maybe I'm just letting everyone know after all....... Maybe that's what it is......."

The shaman hangs his head, and speaks laments.

"If you knew the future in full....... would have looked like."

-.......

"Even if I had full knowledge. As my actions change, so does the future. To know the future is to know nothing."

-.......

"Or is it that the future itself, clumsily learned, is....... Or was it orchestrated to fulfill its destiny......."

-.......

"I didn't realize I was no different....... I didn't realize......."

The shaman stares at the flickering candle.

"I wanted to do something, so I screwed up something......."

-.......

"I feel like this......."

The shaman finally, slowly, moves his eyes to look at the cat.

"You tried to change a fate that not even the gods could change......."

-.......

"It was stupid."

The cat sat still and looked at the shaman.

"You, you don't need my words."

-.......

"You know what to do."

-.......

"Well, you can do that."

At the shaman's words, the cat stared at the shaman for a long moment, then stood up.

The cat left without a word, and the shaman sat alone in front of the candle for a long time.
