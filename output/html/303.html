You've won.

I accomplished what I wanted and everything worked as expected, but I felt like my soul had been stolen.

And I should have realized that I was only thinking about the pageant itself.

Anyway, I need to get out of the convention center, and there's no way I'm going to have an army guarding me. I should have thought that there might be some crazies around who would definitely try to catch me on the way back.

But I was only thinking about winning, not planning a safe route home.

Many of the exiting audience members were waiting to catch up with me on the way back.

I couldn't help but notice the crowd outside the auditorium.

"......."

I feel like a celebrity.

But the difference between me and a celebrity is that I'm a cross-dresser. I'm surrounded by a bunch of guys, both male and female, who all want to know who I am.

If you tell me it's Reinhardt, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't want to know!

If you leave, you'll get caught.

If they get within striking distance, I'm not sure I can keep my fist out.

The other contestants in the pageant saw me at the exit and smiled sheepishly.

Obviously, there was no way they were going to get screwed.

What to do?

Apparently, this is the only way out.

Should I go out the window?

"That....... If you're not going to leave......."

"?"

As I stood in the doorway, unable to get past, someone spoke to me. I turned around and there was Kono Lint. He'd changed his clothes so he wasn't wearing a dress, but his makeup made him look ridiculous.

Of course, I'm here with clothes on, so I don't have anything to change into.

I could have just walked away.

"Oh, I'm sorry."

When I moved out of the way of the door, he sulked and tried to get past.

He's a dick to me in a different sense than he was to Reinhardt.

Konorint, I didn't get a good look at what that guy was doing, but I know what happened.

You teleported something other than yourself.

In the original, the most advanced form of Kono Lint's ability was to move everything with him, including his clothes. I don't know what happened, but this guy can now move other things.

I don't know if it's an enhancement or what, but I do know that Kono Lint has come a long way from the original.

Conor Lint's ability boost is more massive than my 5 hp increase today.

Kono Lint continues to stare at me, and I'm about to make my way to the exit.

Ability boosts.

Spatially move something other than yourself.

"Okay, wait, wait, wait."

I grabbed Konorint's arm without realizing it.

"Eh, yeah?"

Conor Lint blushed as I caught him, his lips quivering sweetly.

A look of not knowing whether to like this or not.

It's not like that, asshole!

There are people outside.

"Uh, can you move me outside, please?"

The only thing that can save me now is Kono Lint.



* * *



Naturally, he freaked out.

Kono Lint went on to explain that his powers weren't meant to be, that there might be side effects, and that he might end up naked. Of course, that could happen.

That can happen.

No! It's okay!

I'm fired!

I've earned 14,000 achievement points for the tournament and the women's competition. Combined with your existing achievement points, that's 18,000.

You can write as much as you want!

"I'll live with the side effects, so please do it."

"Well, at least....... Well, you might get a nasty surprise......."

Even when I blindly asked him to just do it, Kono Lint had a hard time doing it.

"It's okay, I don't blame you, I'll take it."

He looks at me as if to say that he thinks it's better to be thrown naked into the distance than to be caught by the people outside.

No!

You made it!

You don't believe me, I don't believe you, but you're a god.

After a moment's hesitation, Kono Lindt nodded with a puzzled expression.

"That, that....... I'll try it then."

Today marks the first time Kono Lint has successfully spatialized an object. Now we need to succeed in spatializing people.

Of course, it's entirely possible to end up moving only your clothes.

So, use retire.

Kono Lint succeeds in spatially transporting me to an off-the-beaten-path area outside the great hall, clothes and all.



[It takes 100 achievement points to cause that event].



100 points.

To my surprise, it was very affordable. I was expecting something like 500 points. Is this guy's ability already so advanced?



[Use 100 achievement points].



"That, hand......."

"Oh, yeah."

Konorint took the hand she held out tremblingly.

Come on, asshole.

Don't be shy, I said, and I glared at Conor Lint as he concentrated.

"Well, even if it doesn't work out....... too....... resentful."

"It's going to be fine."

"......."

He breaks his concentration and looks at me.

"...... Do you trust me?"

No.

What was I supposed to do?

Just let me go already!

"Sure."

I couldn't help but smile and say so.

-pot!

Then, in a blink of an eye, the scene before me changed.

"Futile."

I had never seen this kind of spatial movement before, so I couldn't help but gasp in surprise.

In one fell swoop, we were on the outskirts of the auditorium, away from the crowds.

I was the only one who didn't move with ConoLint.

The effect of the resignation was clear.

Luckily, I was still wearing my clothes. Now that I'm safely out of sight, all I need to do is change and get back on track.......

While I was thinking about that.

-pull

"......."

I could see something falling out of thin air.

What is it?

I picked it up out of thin air as it fell to the floor. I held it up to the dim light around me.

"......."

The moment I saw it, I realized I had written the wrong exit.

The clothes Conor Lint was wearing just a moment ago have fallen off.

Kono Lint manages to move me to the outside of the great hall, away from the crowds. Along with his clothes.

That bastard.

He sent not only my clothes, but also his own.

Somehow, it was dirt cheap.

Oh no, there's a new penalty for Conor Lint: having to send his clothes with him?

Still a dime a dozen or you?

Do I need to return this?

No, why don't you just come over here too?

Now that things have gotten to this point, you're going to have to come get your clothes.

But this is the boulevard.

Showing up here in your underwear would be too much for Kono Lint to handle.

They think I'm just a girl in a dress.

Should I give this back?

"......."

What's the point of getting out of this?

I'm tempted to just take it out.

I can't do better than that.

"Fuck......."

Eventually, I was forced to stagger back toward the auditorium where the pageant was taking place, still in my dress.



* * *



Luckily, I didn't have to face the crowds in the auditorium.

There were familiar faces on the benches slightly further away.

Heinrich, Erich, Kaier, and Liana de Granz were nearby, waiting for the upcoming Kono Lindt.

It's also dangerous to go to them.

But I hated being caught by the "I'll give you my brother" crowd more than I hated dying.

-Why doesn't she look like this?

-Do you want to change?

They were grumbling that the cono lint wasn't coming out fast enough, so I approached them, fortunately in a position where the light wasn't too bright and they couldn't easily see me.

"Well, over there......."

"......?"

I could feel everyone's surprise when the winner of the pageant suddenly showed up with the clothes.

"He's prettier than me. Why? Do you have to pee?"

Riana smiled at me and asked.

You are such a bitch!

All the other men were frozen, so Riana was the only one who could talk.

"Royal Class....... You're students, right?"

"Yes, but?"

It didn't matter if I noticed because I was wearing a royal class uniform.

"These are Mr. Lint's clothes......."

"......?"

At that point, everyone's faces went blank.

"He asked me to spacewalk outside....... I asked for a favor, but I also asked for your clothes....... and send them to....... It's going to be difficult....... But I'm not sure I can go back......."

"Ah. I see."

Riana held up a hand to silence me, as if I didn't need to say more, and then snatched up Kono Lint's clothes.

You're so good at recognizing these things.

My assessment of the subject I'd just thought of as a bitch had changed like the flip of a palm. Riana giggled and looked me up and down.

"If you're into that sort of thing, you should come over to the Duke of Granz."

"Is that ......?"

"If you say your name is Liana de Granz, they'll open the door for you, and you can try on all the men's and women's clothes you want."

He laughed, and it was clear he was trying to put me down.

You.

You're a real bitch.......

Anyway.

After returning Kono Lint's clothes to their side, I left the place like a fugitive.

I've seen enough dirty looks.

Now, please, let's get back on track.



* * *



There's no end to the dirty looks.

Yeah, there's no way you're going to let me off scot-free in this situation where your goal is to humiliate me.

I try to get away, but I end up being chased by someone who recognizes me.

"Hmm, that. Not a weirdo."

"......."

"I'm just wondering, if she's so broke, why she's going to a competition like that if she's struggling so badly. Hmm."

A middle-aged man with a bald head grabbed me and started rambling on. I think he was in the audience, but he was talking about how he was not a weirdo, he had a successful business, and his children were about to enter the Temple.

"I mean, if things are tough, I can personally sponsor you."

What is this.

I don't know why it's gotten to this point.

It could be that this person is actually a do-gooder who's trying to help you out of a pinch.

But you have a weird look in your eye.

You know what's really weird about the way you're looking at me right now?

I felt goosebumps all over my body.

"Of course, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I'm not looking for anything. It's just, if you have any difficulties with Temple life, you can talk about it. Uhm. Let's do that."

Yeah, I can say that, but you've got a weird look in your eye.

I'm pretty sure he's neither a Temple student nor a faculty member, so should I just slap him and tell him to stop talking shit?

Unfortunately, it's a festival and there are people everywhere in the temple. Naturally, there are guards on duty.

It would be even more embarrassing if I got caught punching someone in the face in public and had to be questioned by the guards. And of course they'd find out I was Reinhardt.

This is the final test.

If you don't hold your tongue here, the whole neighborhood will know that Royal Class Reinhardt won a cross-dressing contest and was dragged off to the Guard by a creepy middle-aged man.

Then it's a suicide angle, really.

Be patient.

One time I couldn't resist and ran into Bertus.

If I can't hold it together this time, it's really over.

"Oh, I see what you're saying, but that's okay."

"Uh-huh, I'll take the favors that adults give me, but let's go somewhere quiet and talk about it."

"It's okay, there's plenty of money in it, it's not that big of a deal."

"Don't think it's too weird, I'm just doing it because it seems like a good idea. Do I look that weird to you?"

"Not because I think you're weird, but because you're really good."

"Well, let's at least talk about it."

Oh, get away from me, you real asshole.

I'm pissed. If you can't understand me when I'm trying to make myself understood, I'm going to have to yell at you.

It's like it's never going to let me go.

"You're making me look so weird. Let's go somewhere quiet and have a cup of tea or something......."

That moment when you realize you can't use your fists, but you need to say something harsh.

"What are you?"

"!"

Someone approached, a man whose voice alone had a meaty resonance.

I turned around and there it was, a human tank.

She's changed into her own clothes, so she's not wearing a dress anymore.

Human Chariots, Richard Howleman.

I was not alone, but with a group of people. There were quite a few people, probably from the same class.

The middle-aged man froze at the appearance of a bully worse than a bully.

"What is it?"

"Oh, no. I don't want to talk to that....... I need to talk to this student about something......."

"This student doesn't seem to have anything to talk about with you."

Richard Howleman then looked in my direction.

Shot.

It's weird, but I'm glad you showed up.

Kick him out!

As if my pleading eyes hadn't already done the trick, the two-meter-plus thug twists his head and looks down at the middle-aged man.

"I don't think you have anything to say, huh?"

"Well, I'm not a weirdo!"

"A slender cow on a lustful night....... No, if you grab a student and don't let him get away with it, that's what makes you a weirdo, not anything else, eh, and won't you get the hell out of my way before I turn you over to the Temple Guard?"

A slender student.

You got your ass handed to you in a tournament by that skinny kid, asshole.

And I definitely meant to say girl.......

"That, that...... seems to have been a misunderstanding. Hmm. Uh, excuse me."

In the end, the middle-aged man ran away with his tail between his legs at the sight of the giant.

-Oh, that's great, Richard.

-Each, but this.

"Oh, it's loud!"

There were some assholes whistling in the back that looked like they were going to be bad.

Thanks for kicking them out, but I think there are worse assholes out there.

"Well, hmm. Big. Gee, are you okay?"

Richard looked down at me and coughed.

I'm kind of giving up now.

This is crazy.......

No, it's already gone.

"Ah....... Thank you."

My blood pressure is rising at the sight of a group of people who appear to be Richard's classmates or seniors whistling. They're probably here to see Richard in this state.

I have no idea why this guy is in a cross-dressing contest, but whatever.

Richard says, red-faced and unable to look at me properly.

"You might want to go back to that....... You'd better get back there quickly."

"Well, you should......."

-Dude, just send it?

-Let's eat!

"Oh come on!"

Richard shouted behind him.

Hey, at least you're being a gentleman. I thought you were a big ol' scumbag.

Now that I think about it, I was the one who started the fight in the tournament, not him.

Overwhelming garbage, I know. Richard looks at me with a troubled expression.

"Hey, you need to get back to work. Before you get in more trouble......."

"Ah....... Yes. Thank you."

Eventually, with the help of an unlikely source, Richard Howleman, I was able to peel back the layers of middle age.
