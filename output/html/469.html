            Episode 469.





The tip of Ellen's sword shook as she faced the demon.

His eyes, body, and legs were shaking.

-Kang! Card draw!

In the Demon's onslaught, Ellen was only able to retreat in an awkward position, unable to land a single offensive strike.

The devil was unforgiving.

The fierce blast of magical energy broke through Rafelt's semi-elasticity and slammed into the auror armor that encased Ellen.

-Bam!

"Ahhhhhhh!"

Hit in the stomach by a heavily weighted kick, Ellen bounced away and rolled unceremoniously on the floor.

Pain.

That in itself wasn't a big deal.

However, I felt like my heart was breaking.

He knows this fight is nothing more than theater. Reinhard would not kill him, and he would never want to hurt him.

It was necessary to show people that a warrior could stand up to a demon.

I wouldn't have known if I hadn't bumped into it, but I did.

Demons are scary, but people need to believe that a warrior can take them on.

That way, when people despair and curse the world, they'll still grit their teeth and try to live with the hope and expectation that one day the devil will die.

For those who hate the devil, they'll do anything to live to hear the story that one day the devil was slain by a warrior.

So even if you don't want to fight, you have to fight somehow.

The demon bounces off and leaps toward Ellen, who rolls on the ground.

And.

-Thump!

A massive, energized slam, crushing the earth where Ellen had just stood.

Ellen had already rolled out of the way.

Somehow he managed to keep his sword pointed at the demon, but the tip of it was shaking violently.

This situation said it all.

The look on Reinhardt's face said it all.

Now.

That things will never be the same again.

Walking hand in hand.

Hug or.

Like whispering to each other that you're important to each other, and sharing those things.

Can't be.

The hope of humanity.

Enemies of humanity.

It's just a relationship that's divided into such a cruel dichotomy.

So Reinhardt attacks Ellen regardless of his true intentions.

Technically, they fight to lose. The devil needs to be defeated by the warrior here and now so that the people have hope.

But Ellen couldn't swing the ramen.

A moon sword that responds to grief.

The power of the Voidblade Ramen was best understood by its user, Ellen.

The Voidblade is an absolute blade that cuts through anything. Even an auror-sheathed swordmaster's blade will slice through the hardest monster flesh with ease.

We do not know if Voidblades can cut through holy items.

However, if you swing it wrong, you could cut Reinhardt to pieces along with the holy relic.

That's why Ellen can't swing her sword around.

Reinhardt might get hurt.

Or maybe Reinhardt will die.

The demon stares at the warrior as he slowly retreats backwards, trembling and helpless.

"Scary, you."

The demon moves slowly toward the warrior.

"You're scared I'm going to die, aren't you?"

"......."

"You are......."

Ellen was tempted to bite her tongue when she realized that the demon had read her thoughts so clearly.

"I."

The demon points the Tiamata in his left hand at Ellen, not at Alsbringer.

"Still."

-Woof!

White halos begin to ripple across the Tiamata in the demon's hands.

"I had a lot to say to you......."

Something is coming.

Whatever it is, Ellen has activated auras all over her body.

Despite the distance, the torrent of divine power swirling through Tiamata was very ominous.

"Do I look like the asshole I was then?"

With this in mind, the demon struck him down in a fit of rage.

The demon unleashes a Tiamata at Ellen from a distance that the sword cannot reach.

-Flash!

Light storm.

Along with the thought of a storm of light that seems to be blinding you.

Ellen felt a powerful destructive force coursing through her body, like it was going to tear her apart.



* * *



-Kurrrrrr

The release of divine power that energizes the force itself, without the intent of the force.

A jet of power ripped through the great plaza, and Ellen barely managed to climb out of the crumbling building.

"Hmph....... ugh......."

Thanks to the protection of my lapel and my Auror armor, I was not seriously wounded.

However, without that protection, Ellen would have been killed by the attack.

The demon bounced a hundred meters away and stared at Ellen as she rose from the rubble of the building.

Right now, Ellen could clearly sense that the demon was furious.

Is he angry because he feels like he's being ignored?

It's not.

Just because you're important.

I don't want to point a sword at you.

Ellen wanted to scream.

But.

It really isn't.

I might get hurt.

How is saying you can't give it your all because you might die any different than ignoring Reinhardt, after all.

The reason he's not confident enough to make this play is because he's afraid Reinhardt won't be able to catch his attack.

That's why Reinhardt is furious.

I still think I'm the same kid.

Do you still think I'm that guy because I'm always right?

Ellen gritted her teeth.

Reinhardt is not the Reinhardt he used to be.

I didn't open the door to the master class, but I became a monster who could take on the master class without opening it.

I've always been ahead of Reinhardt, so it makes sense that I'm ahead of him now.

You can't say that you didn't have that feeling.

Ellen recognizes her arrogance.

Reinhardt became stronger.

Maybe even more than yourself.

Ellen holds the ramen with both hands.

Now we need to play.

You have to show people a play where you defeat a demon after a hard-fought battle.

The difference.

One mistake, and they're forced to make risky plays that could kill each other.

If you think about it, that's not hard to do.

Did I really need to be this nervous, scared, and panicked?

It's still heartbreaking and painful, but Ellen has to admit it.

It's not hard to do.

If you think about it.

We've crossed swords countless times.

Until it's past your bedtime each day.

At first, Reinhardt was barely worth fighting, barely able to walk. Then Reinhard taught him swordsmanship.

At some point, I got to the point where I could take it a little easier.

Every day like that.

I crossed swords every day.

At some point, Reinhardt got so good that I had to play against him.

So Ellen's breathing became labored until she was out of breath.

Daily.

Every moment.

They've been relentlessly pitted against each other.

As such, they know each other's swords better than anyone else in the world.

That's why it's easy.

It should be easy.

Ellen holds still and points the Voidblade she holds in both hands at the demon.

The trepidation was gone.



* * *



Fortunately or unfortunately, the Voidblade was unable to ring the holy relic.

A blade that could cut through anything could not cut through a holy object.

But all other defenses were defeated.

Demons could parry Voidblade Ramen, but only if they were blocked by a holy object. It could not block attacks directed at its body.

No matter how powerful your enchantments are, or even if you have access to Auror armor.

In front of the Voidblade, it was a piece of paper.

-Kang! Card gain!

The people could see that the warrior who had been trembling in fear, unable to do this or that, once he began to attack, he was unrelenting in his pursuit of the demon.

I don't know why I was freaking out, but now was the time.

Apparently, the Demon that had withstood the onslaught of the other Master Classes was now only concerned with blocking attacks against the Champion from a certain point onward.

In this fight, however, no one realized that Ellen was deliberately avoiding dealing a fatal blow to the demon, and that the demon was deliberately acting desperate to retreat.

Reinhardt's swordsmanship is essentially Ellen's, and Ellen's swordsmanship is essentially that of the warrior Lagan Artorius.

As such, it was inevitable that Ellen would know everything about Reinhardt's swordsmanship, and because of the difference in actual talent and aptitude, Reinhardt's swordsmanship would be an inferior version of Ellen's.

Demons fight by exchanging holy objects.

Use Alsbringer, then recall it, and summon Tiamata to fight if necessary.

When necessary, she summoned holy objects in each hand and wielded them like twin swords, but as far as Ellen could see, it was a matter of trusting her physical abilities, not finesse.

Reinhardt's swordsmanship was basically fighting with a single sword. Ellen's swordsmanship hadn't changed.

I had no one to teach me the unusual art of dual-wielding, and I wasn't about to abandon the foundation I'd already laid for dual-wielding just because I had two holy relics to get good at.

Therefore, the Devil's Sword was still readable by Ellen.

Of course.

"Maybe it's fighting to be read.

This is just theater for show.

So maybe he's intentionally attacking Ellen to make it easier for her to read, and she'll take it.

They crossed swords for an excruciatingly long time.

So it made sense that Reinhard could read Ellen's sword, just as Ellen could read Reinhard's sword.

Of course, just because it's theater doesn't mean it's all sword and sorcery.

-Bam!

"Ugh......black!"

When he sees an opening, he'll actually try to hit Ellen over the head with his sword, or stab her in the back.

-Bam! Quack!

Ellen deflected Reinhardt's sword with her lambent, then dealt the demon a physical blow with a left fist or kick.

It was a rough-and-tumble affair that no one would consider theater.

The scale of the fight is different than it used to be in the temple, when I didn't have access to enchantments.

It was a nasty, nasty fight, with fountains shattering, earth being crushed, and a few buildings falling apart as they were blown away.

No one else was allowed to interfere in the battle between the warrior and the demon.

Not the crowds, but the knights and wizards of the Empire, who watched the spectacle with bated breath, fearing it would be distracting.

It was a play, but to those who didn't know it was a play, it looked like a demon and a hero fighting for their lives.

And, yes, they were indeed risking their lives.

It's a situation where if one side makes a mistake, the other side dies.

No demons, no warriors.

They were at each other's throats, pointing swords at each other.

The great plaza for the execution of the Empress had been turned into a ruin by the fight between the demon and the warrior.

Until when.

Do we have to show people how we hurt each other?

Biting her lip until she could taste blood, Ellen thought to herself as she lunged at the demon.

Aim the ramen at Reinhardt's heart.

Now that he has shown this sword path, Reinhardt will attack with his left fist, a kick, or a twisting elbow as he parries the ramen with his Alsbringer.

If he did, he would block the attack with his Auror armor and set up a follow-up.

This attack is possible because they are reading each other.

Just like that.

That moment when you extend your sword, trusting that it will deflect the thrust.

Reinhardt doesn't deflect the Alsbringer, but rather stabs it toward Ellen.

-POOF!

-Kang!

"!!!!"

Ellen's eyes widened as she watched her sword pierce Reinhardt's chest like a lie.

Naturally, the Alsbringer aimed for Ellen's chest in her Auror armor, and she was forced to deflect it.

Intentionally allowed an attack.

Ellen's face went white, never thinking she would allow this attack.

"¯....... 으......."

The demon takes a few steps, then backs away.

Slowly backing away from Ellen, who is so startled that she loses her grip on the sword, the demon pulls out the ramen that has been stabbed into his heart.

-Bang!

The ramen drops to the floor in a heap, and Reinhardt slowly backs away.

"Me, me....... me......."

Reinhard glares at Ellen, who is about to say something.

As in, don't say anything.

As if we haven't already seen how Tiamata can heal wounds.

The demon who speaks only with his eyes retreats, clutching his pierced chest.

The demon raises one hand to the sky.

As if that's a sign,

A crack in the air reveals someone.

Ellen's eyes widened at the sudden appearance.

Herriot de Saint-Ouen.

Herriot, tearing through space, grabs the staggering Reinhardt.

Herriot and Ellen's eyes meet for a moment.

No Harriet, no Ellen.

There's a lot we want to say to each other, but we know we shouldn't say anything.

Ellen could only watch, dumbfounded, as Herriot escaped the wounded demon with a quick spatial shift.

Silence permeated the great square.

Most of them have fled the scene of the battle between the hero and the demon.

But there were definitely people watching.

The warrior, who at first seemed to be terrified, then, as if he had made up his mind, began to take on the demon, pushing him harder and harder until he finally mortally wounded him.

As the demon recovered from his wounds, he chose to flee rather than fight further.

It obviously felt threatened and ran away.

In other words, the devil is not immortal.

-Ma....... Demon.......

-The king has fled.......

-You made the devil run....... He made the devil flee.......

We all know the devil isn't dead.

I know that the healing power will restore him.

But in any case, the demon decided he couldn't take on the warrior and fled with his minions.

-The king has fled!

-The warrior chased the demon awayAhhhh!

A few people who had the audacity to watch the bloody battle from afar in the great square began to shout.

Reinhardt was getting the picture he wanted.

I painted a picture of a near-immortal demon in the middle of the ecliptic suffering defeat at the hands of Ellen Artorius, and so it was.

He made everyone see that a warrior could stand up to a demon, just as they hoped.

But it was the feel of the sword as it plunged into Reinhardt's heart that terrified Ellen.

Many civilians were dying, they were unable to execute the princess, and the devil himself appeared.

But such a demon was driven out by the hand of a warrior.

I couldn't kill it, but I might be able to.

Ellen was shaking with fear.

-You have defeated the demon!

People were praising the warrior.

The deeper the despair, the greater the hope.

But the more people projected hope onto themselves, the more Ellen felt her own despair grow.
