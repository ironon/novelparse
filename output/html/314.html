            Episode 314





Friday.

Today we have the Miss Temple contest and the finals of the unlimited weight tournament.

Olivia Ranze, who has to participate in both, will be very busy. The Royal Class first-years didn't seem to have much interest in an unlimited tournament starting with the quarterfinals now that their classmates aren't competing.

Ellen, Riana, and Kliffman were busy preparing for the contest.

However, Ellen saw me in the morning and just stared at me.

"Today......."

You know what to say.

"Why don't you go?"

"......Yes."

Ellen watched all of my tournament matches. Even if she didn't, there's no reason she can't go to the Miss Temple contest today.

I'm still not sure what to do about Mr. Temple, though I'm sure I could write a retrospective and make Cliffman Mr. Temple.

There's no reason I shouldn't go to the contest. Ellen looks at me hesitantly, then with a look of determination on her face.

"...... come on."

"Okay, be prepared."

"Yes."

When the contest is over, I wonder if I'll have anything to say.

He had that look on his face.

Ellen left with those words and went off somewhere with Riana to get ready.

While the others were off to their own festivities, I decided to go it alone during the day.

Without anyone present.

Now I'm going to watch the finals of an unlimited tournament, away from the attention of my classmates. I'm sure some of them will be there, but I'm going alone.

Olivia has a lot to be sorry for. She's always there for me, and she'd do anything for me, but she always puts me down. Yesterday, she even cheered for Harriet in public.

Just because you're a jack-of-all-trades doesn't mean you're a master of none.

I don't know if any of you guys are going to watch the finals separately, but I was going to watch the finals of an unlimited tournament without going with anyone.

Even if you start with the quarterfinals, there are only three matches left. So even if you didn't have to sit for very long to watch the final, it would be quite short.

-Wow!

The cheers from the crowd were incredible.

It doesn't change the fact that Herriot lost.

But just because the result was what I thought it would be doesn't mean the process was what I thought it would be.

Just as my tournament had its own twists and turns, the Unlimited tournament had some upsets.

Olivia has only dropped one set so far, and that was the one that Herriot took.

I was waiting for the game to start when I heard someone calling out to me from behind.

"Reinhard, you're here for the finals too, right?"

"Oh, Charlotte."

It was Charlotte.

Even if I was watching it alone, it was zoned so I was bound to run into someone if they came by.

Why would Charlotte need to watch the finals anyway?

The reasoning behind this was simple.

"I see you're here too?"

"Yeah."

Apparently, it's not Charlotte, it's Saviolin Tana who misses her. She can't leave Charlotte's side, but she wants to see the final.

Charlotte's not stupid, so she probably read Tana's mood and said, "Let's go watch the finals.

"If you want to go, I'll go. Why are you here alone?"

"Oh, just."

"Really?"

I figured I'd rather see it on my own than bring someone with me, but I wasn't going to move my seat just because I ran into it.

Naturally, Charlotte and Saviolin Tana sat next to me.

Charlotte looked around and crossed her arms.

"Hmmm."

"Why?"

"Huh? No......."

This neighborhood is reserved for VIP seats in the Royal Class.

That said, there are other VIP seats available.

Just now, Charlotte was looking at the VIP seats for dignitaries.

"Lord Bolton."

"Bollton?"

I shook my head, and Saviolin Tana looked at me.

"Didn't we say hello at the last fundraiser?"

"You mean at the fundraiser?"

I'm sure there's a name or two I've forgotten after saying hello at a sponsorship event. Bolton? Who's that?

"Hmm.

"Hey, you have a bad memory.

For a moment, I see that thought pass through Saviolin Tana's eyes.

"Sir Elayon Bolton, the current leader of the Crusader Knights."

"Ah."

Right.

You've heard the name before. Elayon Bolton, the new leader of the Crusader Knights after Leviathan Lance was deposed.

I didn't know who he was, and he didn't sponsor me, so I forgot about him.

Charlotte gave a subtle smile.

"I looked to see if it came yesterday, and it didn't, but it did today. Well, it's finals, after all."

"You don't think ...... would want to see Olivia win?"

"Well, ....... I'm not sure what Lord Bolton thinks, but it's a bit of a sight to behold."

How would the current leader of the Crusader Knights feel about seeing a potential next religious leader renounce his faith and win a tournament without divine power?

This can't be good. I remembered the name and recognized the face.

Not quite the same as Levereer Ranze, but just as stern and stubborn. He was dressed in robes, not knightly armor of course, and surrounded by an entourage of what appeared to be paladins, all of whom stood still and watched the action.

Saviolin Tana, who had been listening to us, shook her head.

"I don't know about Olivia, but maybe she's rooting for the other side."

"The other one?"

"Final Four, don't you know?"

"I don't remember any of them, except for Olivia."

Charlotte laughed wryly, as if she didn't even remember something that had nothing to do with her.

"We have a finalist who is certain to join the Crusaders after graduation."

"Oh....... Really?"

"I suppose it's something you might want Olivia to win."

Olivia's abandonment of her faith is inevitable.

So, the next Crusader might want to take the win from Olivia, who doesn't even use holy power.

Certainly, there were a few wannabe paladins in the Unlimited tournament field. Most of them were a force to be reckoned with.

Jordan Windsor, Royal Class 6th Grade A-3.

Radia Schmidt, Royal Class 6th grade, B-2.

Radia Schmidt.

The person who wondered what Olivia and I were talking about.

Someone who seems like a good person, but has a strange feeling about them.

He was a prodigy, using holy power with magical enhancements.

By the way.

Olivia is also a year in, so Radia Schmidt and Olivia are actually friends who have been at Temple for a long time.

Do you think they have bad feelings for each other because Olivia left her faith or something?

It's entirely possible that Radia Schmidt would be jealous of Olivia if she were to join the Crusaders.

In many ways, it would have been a comparison. As good as Radia Schmidt is, she wouldn't have been able to beat Olivia in the end.

If Radia Schmidt had been a member of Grace, I would have seen her once, but my first encounter with her was a brief conversation in front of my dorm.

If there was always someone above you who was a perfect match for your talents, that would be a pain in the ass.

While we were chatting about this and that, the moderator started running the contest.

-Royal fifth grader who has only dropped one set so far! Olivia Ranze!

Olivia teleports onto the field as the crowd cheers.

Despite the slight mishap yesterday, Olivia had regained her easygoing smile.

The difference is that Olivia, who had been fighting with her bare fists, is now wielding a sword.

Maybe he realized that he didn't need to draw penalties in the semifinals. Or maybe they realized that if they let their guard down like they did yesterday, they could lose a set.

The quarterfinalists were two sixth graders from Royal and a fifth grader from Orbis.

The Royal Class side was all Temple High School seniors.

Olivia Ranze's quarterfinal opponent is a fifth grader from Orvis. Melan Beniere.

It must be heartbreaking to have your Orbis class disappear right before you graduate.

The Orbis class was the cradle of revolutionary forces, and most of the students and teachers involved either dropped out or left the teaching profession.

Those who remain are either those who have not been subsumed, or those who have been subsumed but have decided to remain in the temple.

Revolutionary Forces.

It makes my head spin every time I think about it.

Regardless of my concerns, the first match of the quarterfinals was about to begin.

The process wasn't that important.

3:0

Olivia Ranze won the match.



* * *



Herriot only had a chance against Olivia because she was using magic, or because Olivia was stronger with a sword.

Her opponent seemed to struggle, but she was no match for Olivia.

Most importantly, my opponent looked frustrated, but not in a defeated way, as if he knew this was going to happen.

Next match in the quarterfinals.

Jordan Windsor, Royal Class 6th Grade A-3.

Radia Schmidt, Royal Class 6th grade, B-2.

They've made it to the quarterfinals, so there's nothing wrong with their skill. I've seen Radia Schmidt and Jordan Windsor play.

Radia Schmidt tends to lose with double buffs, and Jordan Windsor is pretty good even without access to holy power.

Obviously, they're very good players that I can't even compete with at this level, and I don't think Herriot would have been able to win against them.

Olivia is overly monstrous, but so are the other Royal Class upperclassmen.

It's a hand-picked group of people who have been honing their skills for six years. So even though Olivia is an off-the-shelf monster, they're monsters, too.

Talent doesn't run away with you.

Lastly, just because Erhi is surplus now doesn't mean he'll be surplus in six years. He seems to be trying these days, so there's a chance he'll awaken to the enchantment by year three, and another three years from there he'll be an unlimited tournament-ready monster.

Olivia Ranze was originally a classmate of the sixth graders, and would have been in Temple with them the entire time, except for the fifth grade when she left to serve in the Demon War.

So I was actually more like a sixth grader.

Your fellow Royal Class classmates face off in the finals of an unlimited tournament.

I thought it would be a fun and interesting experience.

If it weren't for the Gate debacle, I could see myself and Ellen facing off in the finals of an unlimited tournament when I moved up a grade.

......, but you'll probably lose.

I could see myself making it to the finals and losing to Ellen in the finals.......

Honestly, I didn't think it would be that offensive.

The second game of the quarterfinals was actually pretty exciting, despite my expectations.

-Take care, Radia.

-Take care of me too.

They smiled and greeted each other, wondering if things weren't so bad between them. Despite their different classes, they seemed to be in good spirits after spending so much time together.

But only for a moment.

Their faces hardened.

As if on cue, the jovial mood is gone, and a scavenger hunt begins.

Melan Beniere, the fifth-grader in Orbis who was just triple-teamed by Olivia, is probably a much better player than I am.

The two fighting there now are sixth graders at Temple.

This is the last time we'll see each other in a tournament like this.

Regardless of how they normally get along, this is the last time they'll be pitting their wits against each other on this kind of specialized battlefield.

So let's be real with each other.

-Woof!

Blue magic coursed through Jordan Windsor's body. It didn't feel like an explosion of flame like Ellen's.

That's the exact opposite.

It feels like we've gone all in on operational stability.

It feels like a well-honed blade, compressed and refined, without any unnecessary horsepower.

It's not about scale.

It's an extremely efficient form of disenchantment, using only the right amount of power where it's needed. Perhaps it's Jordan Windsor's style of enchantment that Ellen and I should emulate the most.

Radia Schmidt's case was a little different.

She slammed her sword down, suddenly, on the arena floor.

-Bam!

The metallic sword pierced the stone floor, and white threads of energy began to rise from the floor and wrap around the sword.

The white glow that enveloped her sword soon began to envelop her body as well.

That wasn't all.

Radia's body was emitting not only white light, but also blue magic power.

Divine power strengthens the body and supports magical enhancements.

A way to add strength to strength.

It's not my place to be self-suggestive, but that double entendre is absurd. Saviolin Tana watches the spectacle and says nothing.

"Divine Power of Als, the War God......."

I had already seen Radia Schmidt play, so I knew she was using the Holy Power of Als.

"The divine power of Als has....... nothing important."

"Yes."

I know, I know.

Als, the War God.

"Divine Power, unable to use the power of healing, instead focusing everything on offense......."

While Tuan's powers are not limited to healing, most divine powers can use healing to some degree.

However, the priests of Als, the war god, do not have the power to heal.

A power that specializes solely in destroying and crushing.

A destructive force that specializes in killing and slaughter.

That is the divine power of the War God.

Having absorbed enough of the divine power from the earth, Radia Schmidt draws her sword, a young sword of white light, and stares down her opponent, bathed in blue and white light.

-go.

-Yes.

They're not just superhuman, they're superhuman.

It's the epitome of royalty: two monsters clashing.

-Quack!

Sword clashed with sword, and I could practically see the shockwave as it cracked the atmosphere.

Given the level of confrontation, it was clear that the weapons issued were powerful artifact-level weapons that could withstand any fight.

And so it was a true battle of the superheroes.



* * *



The second match of the quarterfinals was won by Radia Schmidt from Class B. The set score was 3:1.

While Jordan Windsor excelled at enchantment itself, Radia Schmidt was able to use the divine power of Als.

That was the biggest difference.

Divine Power's emphasis on destruction was enough to make me shudder. Jordan Windsor was defeated by Radia Schmidt, who was aided by divine power.

Since there is no change in the number of people between classes A and B, it is not uncommon for class B to overtake class A in senior year.

Still, it's kind of weird to see it with my own eyes.

I could see a defeated Jordan Windsor gritting his teeth.

Whatever their usual relationship, in the end, they had lost by a decisive margin, something they had practiced with all their might throughout their temple life.

Accepting defeat is hard for anyone.

I didn't really empathize with either of them. If anyone deserved it, it was Olivia today.

Of course, unlike me, the audience seemed to be satisfied with the spectacle, since there was nothing to take in in the first place.

But this one, can Olivia win?

Olivia can't use her divine powers, and Radia Schmidt is at full strength.

What is the relationship between Radia Schmidt and Olivia?

If Radia Schmidt had been jealous of Olivia her entire time at Temple, she would have wanted to defeat her with all her might.

With a little time to spare, the finals were just around the corner.

After all, it's a match between classmates.

Olivia Ranze, who was A-1.

And then B-3, Radia Schmidt.

The finals spectacle was a little different than I expected.

Olivia's usually easygoing smile had hardened, and Radia Schmidt was smiling.

-Olivia.

-......Yes.

The vibe between the two of them was cheesy.

When talking to Jordan Windsor before the game, Radia Schmidt's usual eyes and smile seemed a little different.

Radia Schmidt.

There was something in her eyes, something akin to madness.

-The divinity I sense in you is stronger than before.

-.......

-Return to the arms of God, Olivia, you were born to do so, you were made to do so, you were made to live outside of the arms of God.

-Ladia, I'm.......

-Come back. Olivia.

It wasn't the jealousy or inferiority complex I expected.

Radia Schmidt had completely different feelings for Olivia.

-Told you, I gave up on the whole thing. I kept saying....... I kept saying.......

-No, Olivia, your divine power, your talent, your character, all of it. You are the only one who can truly unite the Five Great Houses. You are the only one who can bring this long history of faith to a close and move it into the next era.

Radia Schmidt smiles and turns to Olivia.

Olivia covers the divine power of Tuan, and Radia Schmidt covers the divine power of Als.

Even the same five major gods are different faiths.

Still, Radia Schmidt was trying to bring Olivia back to the faith. Olivia's embarrassment was palpable.

-Come back, Olivia.

-Sorry, Radia, I'm not going back.

I realized that I didn't know the specifics of what life in Olia's temple was like.

Just as Olivia's talent was something Leverier Lancet didn't want to miss.

A lot of people cared about Olivia, not the least of which were her classmates, who had a soft spot for her.

You've heard stories like this ever since you gave up your faith. You've heard it from people in the religious community, and you've heard it from many of your former classmates.

Those who had gotten along so well when she was a believer would have done anything to convince her to change her mind once she renounced her faith.

Olivia is tired of it.

In the end, contrary to my expectations, Radia Schmidt was not jealous of Olivia Ranze, but rather one of her most ardent followers.

"What are you talking about?"

As I and Saviolin Tana focused on the two in the distance, Charlotte asked Saviolin Tana.

"...... is trying to convince Olivia to return to her faith."

"ah......."

Charlotte sighed.

"You must be tired, too."

"......."

Olivia's exhaustion bordered on despair.

You know you're going to have to deal with this for the rest of your life.

There was more to Olivia than I realized.

-I have only one answer, Radia, and that is that I have no intention of returning to the arms of God.

Radia closed her eyes for a moment at Olivia's words.

-I see....... Then brace yourself.

-......will?

-Yes. Determination.

Once again, Radia Schmidt slammed her sword into the arena floor.

-A willingness to endure sad things.

-Kagak!

Radia Schmidt didn't seem evil. I was just being unnecessarily nervous. She had a kind smile on her face when she spoke to me briefly.

But Radia Schmidt, the woman Olivia was talking to, was a strange person.

The smile is gone from Radia Schmidt's face, and it's clear she's not feeling the same way she did in the semifinals.

Madness and obsession.

-Everything that is going to happen from now on is the will of God to put you on the right path.

-Whoosh!

Divine power surged from the arena floor and enveloped Radia Schmidt.
