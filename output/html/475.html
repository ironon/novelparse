I've only stuck around because I couldn't leave Edina, and as long as there was someone to replace me, I was going to leave Edina as soon as possible.

I had planned to leave the very next day after I finished packing.

The night before you leave.

Charlotte came to visit.

Charlotte seemed incredibly confused at first when she saw me sharing a bedroom with Harriet, but she didn't ask any questions.

It's that feeling of not asking for anything and then getting stuck.

As if that's what you'd think if you made that decision.

Charlotte asks as we leave the bedroom and meet on the terrace.

"Reinhard, I have a question for you."

Charlotte asks me.

"What is it?"

"I need you to clarify where my permissions start and end."

I wonder if it means that they want to know where the line is between what they can and can't do.

After all, Charlotte is a rolling stone.

After two years of just getting by, you're suddenly crowned king, no matter how confident you are that you can do better.

Charlotte looks out the window with a calm expression.

"I can certainly control the demons and vassals, but as you know. The Senate and other public figures are your friends and allies, so my command and control will not work."

"......Yes."

"I'm glad you trust me, and I'll try to live up to that expectation, but your long absence from Edina at this time of year....... will inevitably lead to discord between me and the others."

Charlotte was speaking reality.

The Senate is not really the people you control.

Riana, Olivia, Harriet, and Airi are my friends.

While they may control those below them, they are no less a public figure than the founding fathers, and may ignore the regent's instructions.

In some cases, like Riana and Olivia, they don't even like Charlotte.

They were both very likely to push back if Charlotte came out of nowhere and started telling them what to do.

That's why my decision to leave Edina before the Regent's rule has stabilized is so dangerous.

Charlotte is saying that there might be infighting.

Charlotte has only one power in Edina.

A declaration of support from me, the devil.

It hasn't been proven that it alone can dominate the entirety of Edina.

"If you tell me that I have no command or control above the Four Heavenly Kings, I'm not going to say anything about their business."

That's why we're not asking for permissions, we're asking for clarity.

I would like Charlotte's regency to be in the form of a full transfer of my authority.

However, I also agree that Olivia and Riana, who have been building Edina up to this point, might be offended by the sudden appearance of Charlotte telling them what to do.

Even if you know rationally that it's the right thing to do, it's hard to accept emotionally.

In fact, the reason I never had a problem with them was because I never had to argue with them. They generally agreed with me, and if they thought I was wrong, we talked about it until we were both convinced.

In Harriet's case, she still wanted to help Charlotte.

In Airi's case, she seems to be feeling the Archdemon's influence on Charlotte, so she should be fine.

But Riana hates the Empire, and Olivia hates Charlotte for not trusting me.

I was concerned about the potential for friction between the two.

What to do.

Above the Four Heavenly Kings.

In other words, if you tell her not to try to control the Four Horsemen and the Senate, Charlotte is only half the story.

I don't need a half-assed replacement, I need someone who can replace me completely.

So, technically, I don't need a regent, I need a demon queen to replace me completely.

"I know my subjects, so I know I don't have the authority to tell them what to do or interfere with them......."

"Enough."

However, Charlotte's words cut me off mid-sentence.

"You are my replacement, whole."

I look into Charlotte's eyes and say.

"You're not a regent, you're just another demon, and that's the way it should be."

Charlotte needs commands, not requests and persuasion.

I hope it is.

I want you to be a complete replacement for me.

Riana and Olivia.

There could be emotional friction with them, and there could be political issues.

Olivia and Riana's crushes on Charlotte may go beyond crushes to feelings of resentment toward me.

If they feel bad for me, I'll feel bad. And I might have to apologize.

But this isn't backyard politics, this is running a country.

Just because Olivia has done so much for me, just because Riana has sacrificed so much for me, doesn't give them the right to override the regency I've established.

If they intentionally try to ignore and exclude Charlotte, I will inevitably be disappointed in them for intentionally interfering with the running of the country over nothing more than their feelings.

In the first place, I don't even think they're the only ones.

They'll recognize the need for Charlotte.

And Charlotte will get the recognition she needs.

You need to prove that you have the ability to do so.

"So, bend it somehow."

"......."

At my words, Charlotte stares up at me.

As soon as you become regent, the king who should be supporting you is gone.

Just as I started out the hard way, Charlotte must lead the country among public figures who hate her.

I didn't put you there to do the easy stuff, I put you there to be a complete substitute for me, even when it's hard.

No, to the command.

"Yeah, okay."

Charlotte nodded.

It's kind of weird to think about this.

I found Charlotte's overly obedient behavior a bit, well, cute.

The next day.

Reinhardt has gone off somewhere.

"What the hell....... Why won't they tell me where they're going......."

Herriot sighed heavily as he looked at the spot where Reinhardt had just stood, having teleported away.

The king left behind a regent, and in his place were Harriet, Charlotte, and Olivia.

Once the handover is complete, Herriot assigns a new scribe and returns to his original duties of magical research.

The Demon King set up the regency partly to free himself, but also to free Herriot, the brain trust.

Charlotte stares at the spot where Reinhardt has gone.

And, naturally, she couldn't help but feel Olivia's eyes on her.

Charlotte glances over at Olivia.

"Do you have anything to say? Bishop Olivia."

"......."

At Charlotte's question, Olivia looks at Charlotte wordlessly. As if trying to gauge something.

Charlotte could read no malice in his gaze.

Obviously, not yet.

"Reinhardt is too nice."

"......."

"Maybe he's too nice to be an asshole, maybe he trusts people he shouldn't. That's what I was thinking."

At the bluntness of the words, Charlotte stares at Olivia.

"If I were to betray Reinhardt, what could I do?"

"......."

"If I were to intentionally screw up Edina, where would I go from there?"

At that, Olivia was speechless.

"I was almost executed by the Empire, and Reinhardt saved me, so there's no way I'm going back to the Empire."

Herriot had been listening to the conversation.

"So there's no reason for me to intentionally screw this up, and there's no reason why I should."

"There are some people who will ruin someone else as long as they ruin themselves. There are quite a few of them these days."

Charlotte nodded at Olivia's words.

"Yeah, I guess so."

Olivia has seen many who would kill a demon, even if it meant giving up their own lives.

A hatred so deep that it will go so far as to destroy itself.

"You won't believe me, and you're right to think that, because I'm guilty."

"......."

"Still, I'll do my best."

Charlotte lowers her tail.

I wasn't even going to fight it in the first place.

It doesn't compare.

The people here because they believed in Reinhardt.

She didn't trust Reinhardt, but he saved her in the end.

It's a different story.

"It's greedy of me to want your support, but please don't think I'm doing something to ruin something."

Charlotte bowed deeply to Olivia.

"In the meantime, good luck."

"......."

A former princess, guilty as charged, bows her head to the one who made a decision greater than her own.

At that unassuming bow, Olivia narrows her brow.

"......Why are you more asshole?"

It would have been better to be annoying, Olivia thought, kicking a rock that rolled unnecessarily.

-Ass! Sucks!

Clapping also requires hands and feet to be in sync.

Once she's angry and the other person hasn't given her an excuse to be angry, Olivia is grumpy and exclaims.

Charlotte looks at Harriet.

"Thanks for everything, Harriet. Keep up the good work."

"Oh, no, why don't you keep your head down......."

Herriot threw up his hands in dismay.

I don't know much about Ellen's home town.

A border town on the southwestern edge of Cernstadt. I'm told by Ellen that it's in the mountains and that many people don't even know it exists. She points out its location on a map, so I have a general idea, but it's too broad.

The name of the town is Liza.

Not surprisingly, the map didn't show any place names.

Originally, there might have been people in nearby villages who knew where Rizaira was. But after the Gate, all such small towns were wiped out.

So you shouldn't expect to find someone who knows the exact location of Lizaira.

We don't know if Lizaira is still alive and well after this incident.

However, we don't know for sure, but Ellen's mother was supposedly a stronger figure than Savior Tana.

I don't know anything specific about Liza and Ellen's mother.

Ellen's mother's name is Luna Artorius.

And he called himself the Lord of the Month.

As such, it is speculated that it may be related to the Lord Vampire clan, of which Sunday and Monday are long gone.

He said it was his policy to stay out of the world's business.

We don't know why this is the case, but if it's true, we can assume that even now, after the Gate scandal, there's been no movement from Ilwondang.

Whether Lizaira escaped the aftermath of Gate.

Is Luna Artorius really staying out of this?

See if I can find Lizaira.

We don't know anything yet.

You can't ask Ellen directly for Lizaira's location. It's best if you don't see Ellen, and you're not in a position to do so.

The reason you want to meet Luna Artorius is simple.

I don't know how to convince her, but I'm going to ask her to teach me. She has a transcendent power that even I can't understand.

I don't know how, and I don't see the slightest reason why she should teach me.

At this rate, I'll have to use Alsbringer in the final fight.

I don't want to die that way.

You may be able to resolve the situation without using Alsbringer, but if for some reason you need to fight Ellen in the future, you will never be able to defeat her in her current state.

It doesn't change the truth that I would have to be at least as good as or better than Ellen for me to have a choice.

You should at least reach the master class before the final fight. If you can, you should have more power than that.

There are some great wizards around me, but none of them have reached the master class.

The strongest, as far as I know, is Saviolin Tanada.

But at this point, it's impossible to ask her to teach us anything that isn't ridiculous.

Therefore, we should look for Luna Artorius, who is presumably stronger than her.

It's a really, really vague thing.

I have to find Ellen's mother and tell her to be strong.

In this situation.

At this point.

It's a ridiculous thing to do when everything is so broken.

There are monsters out there somewhere on the continent, but as I stood in the mountains of southwestern Cernstadt, I had only a vague sense of dread.

"Is this....... What is......?"

You said it was a mountain town.

In front of me was a mountain range that looked like a natural fortress, full of bizarre rock formations.

When Ellen told me about it, it felt like a small backwoods village, but it was a huge alpine landscape.

Geographically, the area was known as the Sren Mountains.

Ellen.......

Espionage You can't call it a mountain village when it's hidden in the middle of nowhere.......

Looking back, I realize that Ellen has always been a little different than the average person.

I didn't think it would be easy to find Lizaira.

As you can see from the map, this mountain range is incredibly vast.

And there's no way in hell there's a road to Rizaira in this rugged terrain.

-Woah, woah, woah, woah

I hear the cries of nameless monsters in the mountains.

Even within those mountains, there are already monsters roaming the continent.

I'd be lost for days, weeks, or months.

If I'm Lizaira Nabal, can I find her in the mountains, where you never know when a monster might try to kill me?

Where will I sleep, where will I get food?

They say it's to prepare for the final fight.

Suddenly, you're playing a survival game in a monster-infested alpine environment.

"a......."

Well, when has anything ever been easy?

I think what I'm trying to find is that somehow I've found it, and I've gotten it.

There's a powerful force at work here.

I'm trying to find Lizaira, and I'm trying to meet Ellen's mother.

So you'll find it, and you'll meet it.

I step into a huge, rugged mountain range.

To avoid sacrificing my life in the final fight.

It has to be stronger.

Must.
