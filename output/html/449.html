I had the wrong idea.

I'm not lying to you.

I didn't do it for the sake of knowing, for the sake of deception, for the sake of revenge.

They knew and loved it.

He knew it all and was generous.

Someone who can't help but hate me.

Who's weird for not killing me on the spot.

He liked me.

That simple thought, that simple answer.

He must have liked Reinhardt more than Reinhardt liked him.

It's one thing to like your classmates, it's another to like your enemy's family.

I liked someone I couldn't like, and I couldn't believe it.

When it matters most, only once.

I just needed to trust you.

It doesn't, and the world is about to end.

It's all your fault.

It was caused by the Demon King's minions, who possessed a strange artifact called Akasha.

But Reinhardt didn't want this to happen.

If Reinhardt hadn't been caught.

Unless there's an extreme situation where the Devil's minions have to make this happen to save Reinhardt.

This didn't happen.

If yes.

In the end, you're the one who brought this on yourself by not trusting Reinhardt when it mattered most.

In the end, you're the one who caused this, not the devil.

Because.

It's all your fault.

It was a difference of just one day.

The clue was at hand, and Reinhardt was not on the ecliptic at the time.

If you held out for a day.

If you had waited a day and asked Reinhardt everything first.

This didn't happen.

Because.

This is all your own fault.

The accumulation of misconceptions and lies had become so tangled that I didn't know what to believe, and time dragged on and on.

One day of miscommunication and mistrust led to all of this.

That broke everything.

Riana, Olivia, and Harriet were willing to trust Reinhardt in this situation.

I didn't believe it myself.

If the world ends.

Your biggest responsibility is to yourself, not to the devil's minions.

Ellen thinks so.

I don't know what Reinhardt's dream was, but I don't deserve to like him any more than he deserves to like me, because I'm the one who decisively destroyed it.

The sinner of the world.

I am a sinner to Reinhard.

I.

We must take responsibility for this situation.

By death, or something else.

Ellen Artorius must be held accountable.

-Bam!

"Boom!"

"Ellen, what do you think you're doing!"

In front of the knights of Shanapelle, Ellen broke the third sword, as if to say that she would not let anyone leave the Temple.

The Swordmasters of Shanapelle were horrified to see Ellen Artorius wielding a Voidblade that could shatter and cut through an Auror blade at the mere touch.

"Back off, I don't want to hurt you."

"If you keep this up, you'll lose the Demon to....... You'll lose him!"

"Don't miss it, because I'm telling you to."

Even with five Swordmasters, Ellen had a feeling that if he crossed the line she had set for him, she'd blow his head off with her Voidblade, not his sword.

Ellen's skills are impressive, but the power of the Voidblade Ramen is such that even Swordmasters struggle with its absolute cutting power.

Combined with the Sun God's holy relic, Ellen's defenses did not allow the Swordmasters to attack in the slightest.

The knights of Shanapelle begin to retreat.

-keeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

Through the broken barrier, flying monsters begin to enter the temple.

"We're not chasing demons, we're killing monsters."

The world might end because you can't trust your crush.

Ellen Artorius became the protagonist of that ridiculous situation.

How responsible would you be if the world ended?

Probably.

It might be all you have.

I'm not supposed to like Reinhardt anymore, I'm not supposed to be like that.

Now that she has made up her mind, Ellen must do something else. She can't allow herself to help Reinhardt. That's for the people who believe in Reinhard.

There's no place for me there.

Because you don't deserve it.

So you should be doing something else.

The only other thing you can do.

Taking responsibility for the situation.

A world that's falling apart because of you, and you have to hold it together.

You must protect a world that may be doomed.

I know that can't be atonement.

There's nothing else you can do about it.

Earn Reinhardt's trust again, build a relationship with him again.

I shouldn't want that.

That's what Ellen thought.



* * *



I thought I was in for an even more abysmal experience outside the temple gates than inside.

However, the situation wasn't as dire as I thought it would be.

-currr

The massive warp gate in front of the Temple Gate had already been destroyed.

The temple was home to some of humanity's most powerful forces, so they had to act fast.

Normally, the archmages of Shanapelle and the Imperial Mages are sent on missions across the continent. But now, due to my presence, they were gathered in the ecliptic.

Monsters are on the loose, the streets are littered with corpses and collapsed buildings, and people are running screaming.

However, the entire ecliptic did not appear to be in danger of collapse.

The flying monsters were constantly being shot down by lightning bolts, fireballs, or unidentified magic from the ground.

The Emperor chose to drastically reduce the number of troops on my side and deal with the catastrophe in the ecliptic.

It also seemed to understand and accept my point that we need to break the very large warp gates first.

While it's nice to see less damage on the ecliptic, it also means that provincial strongholds will suffer more because of the influx of troops.

An empire can't be in every field, every place.

As the ecliptic quickly stabilizes, the damage across the continent will be even greater.

And it's not in my best interest for the chaos of the ecliptic to stabilize quickly.

We must escape the ecliptic.

Fortunately, the guards, as well as the elite of the Empire and the Crusaders, were busy dealing with the situation, and the area around the monster-free Temple Gate was quiet, though there were signs of destruction.

-curl!

A crack appeared in the air, from which a woman with auburn hair soon emerged.

"Degradation!"

Elise appeared and hugged me fiercely.

"Are you okay?"

"......."

She bit her lip, unable to find the words to express her concern.

Elise did what only she can do: she fired up Akasha.

Without causing this level of chaos, there would be no way our overstretched forces could save me.

And as if that weren't enough, I wouldn't have gotten out the front door of the Temple without the unexpected help of Olivia, Harriet, Liana, and Ellen.

"First, you need to leave."

Eleris said, her eyes trembling, as if her own heart or thoughts were not worth speaking of.

Everyone was a little wary of Elise because they didn't know who she was.

"That person is......?"

But as far as Herriot was concerned, I had seen Eleris. The one I was supporting at Richie's grave.

I look at Harriet and say, "Because the person who lent me so much magic is here again.

"I don't have time to go into details, I'll talk to you after we get out of here, whatever."

At my words, Harriet nodded with a stony expression.

-Kaaaaaah!

-Grrrrrr!

The cries of nameless monsters filled the air.

-Ahhhhhh!

-God's judgment has fallen!

The cries of people driven mad by fear echoed everywhere.

"South of the ecliptic, Galarsh and Leruen are casting mass teleport and waiting, if you can make it that far......."

How much did it run.

Some of the articles that seemed to be scrambling to deal with the monsters found us.

"Scotra Kelton......."

We ran into Scotra Kelton's unit, the leader of Shanapelle's 3rd Battalion.

He was there during the interrogation just now.

Can we break through the knights of Shanapelle, even if they include Elise?

Seeing the look on their faces, Elise opened her arms to wrap around us and bite us back.

Scotra Kelton stares at us.

The demon has escaped.

As a knight of Shanapelle, he would have been obligated to prevent our escape.

The knights, including the Swordmaster, slowly make their way toward us.

"Jae-hyun, I'm......."

"Shut up."

What Elise is trying to do.

I know what I want.

"Don't try to find a grave in front of me."

It's pretty obvious what Elise wants.

We can't just let them die.

Although she's not actually my mother.

Ever since I came to this world, Eleris has been like a mother to me.

Just because a bean fails.

Just because the wind is down.

I opened the gates of destruction with my own hands.

I have no intention of letting them rest in death.

You have to live a little longer.

Like I could have solved everything by doing nothing, but I didn't know that and ended up creating this crazy situation.

As if to force myself to live this life that I would nevertheless trade for countless others.

Elyse must live, too.

You're alive and you have to do something.

Even if you can't pay for your sins, it would be cowardly to try to escape it all with death.

You can't pay for your sins with death.

I had no intention of letting Elise find a place to die.

Watching the upcoming Swordmasters, including Scotra Kelton.

Hold the flame of the day.

"I said it's something that responds to dark emotions."

It is an inauspicious object that reacts more intensely to killing, hatred, and anger, Eleris said as she handed me the flame.

This emotion I'm feeling right now must be a dark one.

No, it's more like the abyss itself than the darkness.

Despair, anger, and pain.

The compulsion to live nonetheless.

I must live in despair in the midst of destruction, not knowing what to do with the position I have created.

I don't even know what I'm feeling right now, only that it's darker than anything I've ever felt in my life.

I hold the flame of the day.

Capturing the power of self-suggestion.

With the power of words.

A spark of hope, representing my despair at the moment.

To the Essence of the Flame.

"Burn."

command.

-Crunch!

"Boom!"

"This is....... What!"

A great barrier of flame rose between the Swordmaster and us, threatening to melt the world.

Where the barrier of flame had risen, the earth melted into lava.

"Let's go."

A barrier of flames stands between me and my enemies.

We ran south.



* * *



The Zodiacal Gradient's vigilance was broken.

We were able to cope with the monsters pouring through the warp gate, but we didn't have the resources to catch a demon running to escape the middle of the ecliptic.

Scotra Kelton's troops were eventually forced to stop chasing demons and focus on taking out the monsters that were slaughtering civilians.

In exchange for finding the demon.

The price humanity paid for not believing in the Devil was bitter.

-currrrr

The collapsed General Headquarters building, the remains of the Great Hall.

Saviolin Tana was stymied by Effinghauser and Loyard.

Effinghauser, Loyard, Sarkozy, and Roussinil.

They paid the price for stalling.

Lucinil was incapacitated, his limbs bound in magical chains, Sarkegar, whose shapeshifting abilities annoyed everyone, was bound in a spatial bond, and Loyaar was groaning in his human form with blood all over his body.

And.

Savior Tana watched as Eppinhauser lay bleeding in the rubble of a collapsed building, a tempesta lodged in his abdomen.

"Why."

Saviolin Tana's voice was shaking.

"Why did you have to do this, Effinghauser?"

As far as she knew, Effinghauser was a patriot. More than anyone else, he loved the Empire and wanted to protect it.

After joining Shanapelle and being active in the organization, at some point he decided that he wanted to help train his successor, so he became a teacher in the Temple Royal class instead of Shanapelle.

Having seen Epinhauser up close, Saviolin Tana was convinced of his sincerity.

Then he sided with the devil.

Demonic forces can do that. They are demons.

But it was incomprehensible to Saviolin Tana that Effinghauser, who was human and loved the Empire more than anyone else, would make such a choice.

She was the one who struck the blow, but she was also the one who felt the most confused.

"Why did you do this, when you were on the side of the Empire more than anyone else?"

"......."

Effinghauser wipes the blood from his forehead and looks up at Savior Tana.

"He also....... More than anyone else....... of the Empire....... was on the side of humanity......."

"......The king?"

Effinghauser nodded wordlessly.

The words that the Devil did not wish for destruction, Saviolin Tana could not yet fully accept.

After all, it was the beginning of a catastrophe that threatened to end the world. No matter how much you say the devil taught you the solution, it's not true.

But Epinhauser was Reinhardt's teacher.

At least, he'd been watching Reinhardt longer than she had.

"No way, did you already know that Reinhardt was a demon?"

"......."

Epinhauser didn't answer.

We're not the kind of people who make things up as we go along.

The fact that he was able to do something so incomprehensible must have been due to his own conviction and willpower.

He even stood up to the strongest man in the world, Saviolin Tana, even though he knew he would die.

He would not have dug his grave in a meaningless place.

As he lies bleeding to death, Effinghauser gives a subtle smile.

"And......."

She's seen a lot of Effinghauser, but this was the first time she'd seen him laugh.

"The teacher is....... seeking disciples is......."

The junior, who always made a grim impression, dies a slow death.

He says, dying.

"Would it be so....... that special......."

As if you only did things because you had to.

Saviolin Tana watched Epinhauser's breath catch in his throat, until the end.

"......."

Lately, she's been having doubts about everything she's built.

Reinhardt.

Demon.

Humans who believe in demons, who follow demons, even though they are demons.

There are those who believe in and love the devil even though they shouldn't.

The many forms and facets of the demon she had seen.

While watching the demon say that he didn't want destruction, that he wanted to save the humans.

If he wanted to divide the humans, he should have said that the Demon's attack on Raziern was an act of the Empire, but he never mentioned it.

And, in a situation where it's almost certain that if you really believed the devil, this wouldn't have happened.

"And now....... I don't know anything."

Saviolin Tana felt lost.
