            Episode 453.





You have seized the throne of the Edina Archipelago.

Too easy.

A rogue who comes out of nowhere and makes the king stand up from his seat doesn't make him the master.

But I am the devil.

Everyone was afraid of me, not just because I was a strong rogue, but because I carried the heavy name of Demon King.

Those who didn't want to know that I was the Devil now know that I am.

So, it doesn't matter anymore that the whole world knows I'm a demon, and I'm going to take full advantage of the fear that comes with my name.

Fear is a very powerful tool of domination.

"As you have seen today, the warp gates of the entire continent have been tampered with to summon otherworldly monsters, which means that the catastrophe that is occurring is a world-scale disaster, encompassing the entire continent, not just this archipelago."

"Therefore, the anomaly that occurred in Rajak also occurred on the other islands of the archipelago, St. Louis, Port Lambeth, and Greenwindle."

"Currently, my men are working to quell the phenomenon at that location."

"The Edina Archipelago will suffer some damage, but due to its distance from the continent, it will end up destroying warp gates across the archipelago."

"The reason I tell you that I am the savior of the Edina Archipelago, which would have perished if left alone, is to let you know that my rule will be quite generous and gentle."

"Submit. You will have stability and peace."

"In the short term, I will focus on stabilizing the chaotic Edina Archipelago, and in the long term, I will venture into the monster-infested continent."

"I'll give you a day."

"We won't kill you if you refuse."

"Let those who will not submit to me leave."

"I will allow you to live as ordinary people in the archipelago. You will be able to escape my rule and go to the continent, but when you cross the long sea route and reach the continent, you will find that there is no land for you to set foot on but these islands."

With the entire continent in a state of chaos, going to the continent was a sign of death.

But they might decide that I'm telling a flat-out lie. They might think that the devil is just saying this to scare them.

It's your choice to believe me or not believe me, to obey me or not obey me.

I wasn't going to force it.

I didn't know if they would accept me, but I had a lot of work to do.

"There's been confusion, and it's scary, but for now, the upheaval in Razak is over. There's no need to be afraid, so let's get to work."

Even if the chaos has stabilized, there are still bodies in the streets. We need to focus on getting an accurate casualty count and stabilizing Razak, not just burned homes.

"All available troops are to collect bodies and determine the exact extent of the damage as of this hour, and report back to me immediately with the status of food and relief supplies stockpiled in the castle."

I could tell they were taken aback by the first mission instruction that wasn't overly demonic.

What is demonic.

Is it demonic to demand a blood sacrifice as soon as you take the throne?

Whatever demon they're expecting, I'm going to be a lot different than the one they're thinking of.

They were still dumbfounded, not knowing what I had asked them to do.

"Get your asses in gear, or get the fuck out of here, or listen to me, or get your asses in gear, you motherfuckers, you think you've got time?"

In the end, it was the same everywhere, I had to yell to be understood.

The soldiers left the castle on my orders, and I began repairing the damage in Razak.

I don't know if they'll be good at what I ask them to do, but it's day one after all.

The vassals were sent away to do their work.



* * *



Late at night.

One by one, they returned to Razak.

Just as I had instructed, they all arrived at the Edina Palace.

Riana even brought Duchess Granz, who had been fleeing from Angel Capital.

I'm sure we've all seen the horrors, but it seemed to make even less sense now.

I had just arrived in Razak when I left to go to another island, and now I was sitting on the throne of Alreal, the royal palace of the country.

"......What happened?"

"You said you were going to take the Edina Archipelago."

That's all I could say to Olivia.

We have a lot to talk about, and we need to figure out what to do next.

Neither Liana nor Harriet seemed to be in their right minds, as if they'd seen something horrible. Not to mention Eleris.

Lerouen and Galarsh weren't quite as grave, but their expressions were very serious.

"One day, one king....... Was it ever so easy."

Lerouen was frozen in place.

"That was easier than I thought, given the circumstances. Anyway, how did everyone handle the situation?"

"The damage was heavy, but we managed to destroy the gate and slay the monster."

They succeeded in controlling the chaos in the four main ports of the Edina Archipelago.

"The local administrations will take care of the damage, but now that this has happened, there could be riots or something......."

"There are a lot of people who have nowhere to go....... There are so many....... How do those people......."

Herriot said with a gloomy look on his face.

"We need to start with a damage assessment in each port: how many people have lost their homes, how many orphans have been left behind, and how much relief we can give them."

It's a headache from the start.

"I'm not going to be able to do any intercontinental trade with the way things are, and I didn't come all this way to make sure the Empire didn't know where I'd settled. The Edina Archipelago has to be self-sufficient somehow from now on."

I became king to deal with the Gate situation, but the country is in crisis from the start. The royal family of Edina will be grateful to have the Devil take this headache off their hands.

We talked a lot.

I had to explain to Airi, who had no idea what was going on.

And what to do next.

What to start with.

How to replace the people whose lives were destroyed and how to take responsibility as a king.

All new to us, all things we never imagined we'd be doing until this morning.

We had to do it.



* * *



It was probably the longest day I've ever had in my life, and I wasn't even done with it yet.

The royal palace was captured, but the castle was home to the royalty that had ruled the Edina Archipelago until now.

It was extortion without cause, but I am the devil.

Just as people have interpreted my behavior as if I were a demon and therefore had evil intentions, I have no intention of justifying my dominance with rhetoric.

I'm going to let them think they're doing this because they're the devil.

You don't throw the royals out overnight. They need to absorb what they know about the archipelago and the intellectual basis of their rule.

I was on the spire of a royal palace, looking out over the nighttime landscape of Rajasthan down the cliffs.

The port city was quiet after the gate was closed. In the distance, I could see soldiers wandering around with torches, collecting bodies at my command.

Smoke still billowed in places, and the cries of children who had lost their parents seemed to be audible.

All of this, my fault.

From the spire, I could see the horizon of the ocean beyond the harbor.

On the continent beyond the ocean, people were still dying.

This was my destiny.

Everyone in the Temple who is not here will probably be called into battle as the general mobilization order is issued.

Someone is going to die, and maybe even some of your classmates because the gate happened earlier than expected.

Even in this situation, which was ultimately caused by me, I'm going to do something, and I'm going to start something on this remote archipelago at the southernmost tip of the continent.

Could this be the path to saving someone's life?

Or are we just setting the stage for another war?

-Ahhhh!

Cries that shouldn't be heard seemed to be heard among the city lights.

-Stephen

I could hear waves in the ocean that shouldn't be there.

"Hey, what are you doing?"

I turned around at the sound behind me, and there was Liana de Granz.

If I became king, would we still be friends?

It was funny that I thought of myself as a king when I hadn't even been on the throne for a day.

Riana stands beside me, arms crossed, looking out over the landscape of Razak.

Liana De Granz.

While magic is important, Riana's Blitz ability was invaluable in taking down the Gate.

It also helped me escape.

"When did you know?"

Riana knew I wasn't responsible for Duke Granz's murder.

That's what saved me.

"Not long ago, my mom told me."

"...... is it?"

"I thought my dad said a lot of weird things, but a revolution, I had no idea he was going to do something like that."

Riana smirked down at Razak. Technically, Riana's discovery of the truth has nothing to do with her saving me.

However, Riana was going to save me, and she did.

It means there was an intention there other than to save me.

"You want to get rid of the empire?"

"......."

Riana was silent at my words.

"I thought you might be able to do that."

You may have been trying to save your friend, but you were also trying to save the devil.

Riana knew that Duke Granz's death was the work of the Empire, and as such, she harbored a vendetta against them.

The fact that Riana didn't immediately attack Bertus, Charlotte, or Tana reminded me of how vengeful she is.

It's a vengeance that can't be satisfied by killing a few royalty.

A vengeance that can't be satisfied, unless it's at the cost of an empire.

How much dark vengeance lay beneath Riana's seemingly carefree expression, I could not fathom.

I wonder if it's similar to the despair I'm feeling, or if it's deeper.

Just as Harriet gave up being a grand duchess and stood by my side.

Liana gave up being a duchess and stood by my side.

Of course, with the world spinning, how much more meaningful would that be?

"Apparently, you didn't really care about that."

"Right."

I said I did all this to protect humans, and I'm still doing it.

To share his vengeance, the demon seemed plausible, but in hindsight, probably not.

I don't want war, and I don't want empires to collapse.

However, Riana stretched and put her arm around my shoulders.

"But it's not like you wanted to do this, right?"

"......Yes."

My existence was already doomed, and by the time I realized it, it was too late.

In the original, the Gate was caused by Valerie, but this time it's at the hands of Eleris.

I didn't want something to happen, so it happened.

I felt like the protagonist of an old oracle.

"I mean, everything you don't want to happen somehow seems to happen?"

"...... Is that a bad word?"

"Because you don't want the empire to fall, somehow it's falling to pieces because of you."

Riana giggles.

It was one of those things where I wasn't even angry because it was overly malicious.

"In other words, if you have to go to war with the Empire, even if you don't want to, I'll give you a hand."

I wanted peace and stability for humanity, but my desire for it led to the Gate.

I still wish for peace, stability, and the maintenance of the empire, but I may be the cause of its downfall.

Because the world seems to be broken, somehow, that way.

Riana seemed to think that as long as she was by my side, she would have her chance for revenge at any moment. With her arms still around my neck, Riana gazes out over Razak.

"Hey, so I....... the Four Heavenly Kings?"

I felt my breath catch in my throat at Riana's words.

The Four Heavenly Kings?

Why is he thinking about this?

"You're ordering me four thousand kings, right?"

Riana looks at me with a twinkle in her eye.

Do it?

I hope you don't think this is some kind of neighborhood captain's game.

"Uh....... What....... If you sleep alone, how can you be King of the Four Thousand?"

"Get the other three. Vampires are like elders or something....... Harriet and Olivia and her sister....... The one with the pink hair? Doesn't that make four?"

I'm dizzy, really?

One minute you're talking about revenge, the next you're talking about this.

"Hey, that's plausible. Magic, paladins, psychics, and I don't know what that pink hair is, but that's four."

Airi, Riana, Harriet, and Olivia.

Riana had apparently drawn up a blueprint for the Four Heavenly Kings in her head even though I hadn't said anything.

I didn't say anything?

"Hey Demon, make my nickname feel a little better. Huh?"

-cookcook

Riana wraps her arms around my neck and pokes me in the side.

"You're an asshole."

At my words, Riana giggled and loosened her arms around my neck.

If you think about it, it's actually pretty easy.

It's lightning, so I'm just going to go ahead and thunder in.......

Why the hell am I even thinking about this?

"Anyway, I'm sure you've been through a lot. I saw the way you looked at me when you ran away earlier."

I hadn't cleared up Riana's misunderstanding, so when I ran into her on the way out, I thought it was all over.

The reality was quite the opposite.

"Good job, how did you resist the urge to make excuses?"

"Excusing it just makes the problem bigger."

"So."

Riana clicked her tongue.

"How have you held out so long?"

Build relationships with people without revealing your identity.

I put up with it under guilt and pressure.

Riana patted me on the head, as if to say that it was amazing that I had held out this long.

"Do you want to keep talking?"

Somehow, talking to this guy takes me back to my Temple days, which I can never go back to.

It was a good feeling, too.

It was also a horribly wistful, wistful feeling.

"Anyway, I'm going. I'm going to rest. I'm tired."

As if it hadn't been a long enough day, Riana stretches and turns to leave.

"Cliffman."

After that, I couldn't help but ask what I should have asked but never did.

"......."

"Are you okay?"

"What do you mean you're okay?"

Riana's voice was calm as she answered.

"Just. Anything."

"I didn't say anything to him."

I seem to recall that we vowed to take revenge on the demon together.

When Riana realized the truth, she didn't tell Klippmann.

I wonder if he realized that the empire was too great an enemy to share.

Riana worked with Herriot, but she didn't tell Klippmann anything.

For that reason, Kliffman will remember Riana as a traitor to the Empire and humanity.

Like I'm going to pile on the misunderstandings.

Riana will also accumulate misconceptions.

I wondered if that was okay.

Because when those misconceptions pile up and explode, it's a horrible feeling that makes you want to die.

"It should be fine."

Riana said and went downstairs.

She didn't tell Klippmann about it, because she knew she was up against a much bigger foe.

Riana, Harriet, and Olivia will be remembered as traitors to the Empire and humanity.

Because of that, everyone has to take on something, and I have to be able to take on what they have to take on.

I am their king, because they chose me.

I must be able to protect those who have chosen me.
