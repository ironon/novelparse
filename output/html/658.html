In a flash of blue light, one Immortal hit was reduced to ash and disappeared.

"......What is it?"

Christina looked at Saviolin Tana with a dumbfounded expression.

Christina doesn't know what a fight is.

But that doesn't mean it's not common sense.

Saviolin Tana is apparently called the First Sword of the Continent, or the strongest knight on the continent.

But what she was seeing was hardly a "prosecutor's" fight.

-Woof!

The azure auror swords floating around Savior Tana were proof of that.

No, it's not in the form of a sword.

A shape that looks like it's been forged and sharpened from horsepower.

There was a shape of an auror that was more of a "spear" so to speak.

Since the start of the battle, Saviolin Tana hasn't drawn her Galeblade Tempesta once, instead throwing her Auror blades around.

That's more like a wizard.

She knows this on a common sense level.

Those who can augment their physical bodies with magical power are those who have attained the level of Enchantment.

If you can go beyond that and enchant your own armor, call it a master class.

Those who go above and beyond, who can create a weapon out of nothing but aurors, a level that few in human history have ever achieved, are called Grandmasters.

"That's weird."

Saviolin Tana looks at the inaccessible Immortal and Christina beyond.

"It's been decades since I reached the level of a grandmaster......."

Saviolin Tana snaps her fingers, and a blue flash blasts the Immortals that attempt to attack her.

-Kookaburra!

There was a huge explosion, and along with a few ports, the immortals failed to react and disappeared in the blast.

"Why does everyone believe I've never taken a single step forward in my 'grandmaster' career......."

Last winter, Ellen Artorius challenged me to a fight.

The fight didn't escalate, so we don't know the outcome.

However, there's a difference between Ellen Artorius's imagined viola tana and the real thing.

It's not the beginning of a grandmaster's journey.

It's been decades since I reached that point, and my body is the same as it was in my youthful prime.

Isn't it a bit complacent to assume that she'll stay in place for decades, content with her position?

A man who lived his life knowing nothing but the sword.

He is a man who realizes that he has nothing in life except the sword on his back.

That time.

The years.

The world's strongest man, who has been on and off the battlefield since the Gate debacle, seriously realized the need for strength and has put his whole heart into honing himself once again.

It'll never be the same.

Why do you think someone who has reached the pinnacle will stay there?

Those who reached the top continued to climb in different directions.

You're wrong to think you'll be able to reach her if you go a little further.

It doesn't matter how hard the people below you have worked to break through and make it to the top.

The pinnacle is no longer where it stood decades ago, and it may have moved even further away.

Because.

Saviolin Tana is now a prosecutor, a title that seems strange to her.

No sword required.

It's not like you don't need a sword because there is a physical form of sword, the Auror Sword.

There's really no reason to fight with a sword.

Saviolin Tana is a being who has reached the point where she realizes that, at the end of the day, everything works.

All of the people who have been pierced by that magic spear while trying to get at Savior Tana are Master Class winners.

Even such beings are wiped out by a single auror shot.

The mind control spells used by archmages also don't work at all.

Training to counter magic is an essential part of a knight's training.

So it's no surprise that magical control measures don't work for the pinnacle of knights, Saviolin Tana.

Swords are swords, and magic is magic.

Christina says through clenched teeth.

"Yeah....... I know you're strong, but whether you can handle it is another matter, right?"

"......."

This basement is where the full power of the Immortals resides.

This is the total power of the immortals that Diane is supposed to be fighting.

Even if Xavier Tana is a powerhouse beyond reason, there are some things that are impossible.

It doesn't change the fact that she's in a crowd now.

It's like a tiger herding a bunch of cats.

But if those cats can pounce on the tiger until it collapses from exhaustion, the tiger will eventually die.

So no matter how strong Xavier Tana is, she's just walking into the middle of an enemy, naked.

There is no set end, it just gets delayed.

The reason Savior Tana is able to hold on right now is because the battlefield itself is limited.

The destruction of the lab itself affects the survival of the Immortal.

He's hesitant to let the fight escalate because he's afraid it might destroy the entire lab.

It's a small space, and you have to protect the lab, so the Immortals can't attack properly.

It doesn't matter how much stronger Savior Tana is than the public perception, it doesn't change the fact that she came in on a limb.

Despite Christina's words, Savior Tana summons several more Auror spears.

"You'll know it when you see it."

The confidence bordered on arrogance, and she couldn't help but grit her teeth.

-Flash!

With a flash of light, Ludwig reappeared on the battlefield where he'd been so long ago.

There are no immortals.

-The monsters are coming!

Suddenly, Ludwig sees the Allied forces in complete disarray as all their reliable allies have evaporated.

The collapse of the Alliance was imminent.

The presence of Immortals is important, but not essential. Allied forces can fight without Immortals.

But a crumbling morale will bring everything down like dominoes.

She's wrong.

No, I didn't even try to find the right answer in the first place.

I knew it was wrong, but I boldly declared that I would do something crazy just for revenge.

Slowly, Ludwig pulls a crystal vial from his bosom.

Then, open it and drink the contents.

"ugh......."

An artificial, nasty flavor that I can't even figure out how to implement.

After swallowing the tranquilizer, Ludwig roughly wipes the corner of his drooling mouth.

-curl!

Ludwig doesn't have an army.

All you have is a body.

You can't fill the void left by Immortal alone.

There are many things you can do with a stronger body than before. But at the end of the day, you only have one body.

On a battlefield of screams and shrieks, Ludwig can kill the monster in front of him, but it's still irrelevant to winning or losing the war.

Just fight.

-Thump!

With a few leaps, Ludwig is in the midst of the monsters, an auror sword materializing in his right hand.

-Whoosh!

With one swift spinning slash, a torrent of creepy-crawly aurors is unleashed and the monsters around them are swept away.

Ludwig could hear the exclamations of the soldiers who watched the ominous but overwhelming force from afar.

Although still irrelevant to winning or losing the war.

When it comes to localized warfare, there's definitely a role for Ludwig.

Someone wielding a pitch-black Auror sword, shaped like a greatsword, strides boldly across the battlefield.

It's so overwhelming that people don't back away, they follow.

They weren't always like this.

Christina, and others who have changed.

The days when we could laugh and talk amongst ourselves have become a mirage.

Someone became the bad guy to kill, and someone became the bad guy while trying to kill the bad guy.

And Ludwig, who watches, becomes a dreamer of his own evil in the name of judgment.

The ones I loved have gone to a place I can't love anymore.

The survivors have been reduced to being unworthy of love.

The one thing that doesn't change.

Fight for the people.

Fighting to save someone.

Because I didn't abandon that one absolute path.

Because you can't turn away from that.

"K......!"

-Koo-koo-koo-koo!

Fight.

With my right arm feeling like it was on fire.

While resisting the eerie sensation of black magic invading his body and thoughts.

Ludwig didn't even think to steal the tears of blood from his eyes.

Swing the sword.

"Aaaahhhhhh!"

It's like you've become a one-headed beast with black magic.

The stray black beast moves forward, slaughtering the monsters.



* * *



Immortal has left the battlefield.

In no time at all, they were gone.

The majority of the Alliance knows what Immortals are. Even those who don't believe the rumors know that they are powerful allies.

They disappeared altogether.

-where....... Where are you going?

Since Immortal's arrival, every battle has been planned with Immortal in mind.

Immortals have shown more power than we could have ever hoped for.

Thus, even those who knew what an immortal really was may have questioned the process, but no one questioned the absolute necessity.

Think about it later.

You'll need it for now.

I'm silent for now, because I need to be.

I know I shouldn't have done it, but I needed it so badly.

The Allies recognized the utility of immortals and relied on them.

It was the same for me.

-Grrrrr!

-Bam!

As I crushed the creature's head with a wave of magic in my fist, I could only stare in disbelief at the waves of monsters rushing into the vacated space.

So far.

Did it have to come to this?

I trusted that there would be at least a little bit of reason left.

You want to kill me, you want to kill the person responsible for the gate.

Do they want me dead enough to abandon everyone like this?

Where is the authority to do this?

Knowing that so many people had so much riding on Immortal, it suddenly disappeared.

The sudden disappearance of the Immortal stuns the advancing army, and they begin to falter and retreat.

Without the thousands of master classes that had swept across their path, and the destructive magic of their archmages in the rear, the army's strength was inevitably diminished.

No wonder the vanguard suddenly disappears when you're supposed to be following.

You grit your teeth and forge ahead, but in the end, your body is one.

In the areas I couldn't cover, the wire was gradually being pushed back.

You're confused, and a nauseating rage is building inside you, but you can't stop it.

There are no immortals.

Disappeared.

-Vanguard is gone!

-Run away!

Dangerous.

Immortals are obviously a big part of the power.

But in the original, you could have the final fight without the immortals, without the Titans.

You can.

Just to be clear.

The evaporation of Immortal took the morale with it.

It forces commanders and soldiers to make fearful guesses.

-Deserted us!

Broken morale is an epidemic.

Others follow the cries of the frightened soldier.

You can.

Without immortals, it's an uphill battle, but not impossible.

Many more will die, but they will not be wiped out.

You can do this without Immortal. Despite the loss of Immortal in the final fight, the Alliance has more than enough troops. You've gotten this far with enough troops intact.

However, Immortals have come to mean too much to the Allies, and their sudden evaporation is as much a betrayal of trust as it is a huge demoralization.

If the front row starts to collapse, so does the back row.

If the entire coalition is demoralized and collapses, that's it.

Now the entire allied army is marching, surrounded by monsters.

If it collapses, it's just rolled up and destroyed, there's no back.

-The Emperor has abandoned us!

Before I knew it, the screams of the soldiers about the evaporation of the Immortals had been replaced by it.

The Empire's secret weapon.

The immortal is gone.

In other words, the emperor has abandoned humanity.

In fear and dread.

A growing coalition of followers of the Demon King.

So those who thought the Emperor had abandoned the Allies were shouting in retreat.

The emperor hasn't abandoned it.

It was not Bertus who abandoned you.

But it doesn't mean anything.

There's no way you're going to be able to capture and persuade soldiers who are screaming random words in terror and desperation.

I don't even have time to rage about the insanity of retreating Immortals.

However.

If you walk away, it's all over.

We've been relying too much on immortals.

As a result, the empty space in Immortal is dozens of times larger than the actual space.

-We're all going to die! We're all going to die!

-Run away!

There's nowhere to run.

There's no point in shouting that we're surrounded.

You'll fall back, step on an ally's foot, get tangled up, start getting crushed by an ally, and then a wave of monsters will come crashing in and you're done.

Just like that.

The moment the Emperor's betrayal sweeps across the battlefield, sending the Allies into panic.

-Currrrrr!

The sky is falling.

A vast crack appears in the sky.

And not just one, but dozens.

Not over the heads of your allies, but all over the battlefield.

The blue sky becomes a spidery crack that projects darkness like a broken mirror.

"ah......."

The sky.

Of course, the sky is visible to everyone.

You'll see soldiers dropping their weapons and fleeing, countless superhumans looking back and not knowing what to do, and mages gritting their teeth and spewing magic from the rear.

Flashing rain from a broken sky.

You see a meteor shower falling over the battlefield.

It's magic that's traumatized everyone.

The day the heavens opened.

Because that's when it all started.

That's why it's a curse on all mankind.

-Wang.......

Everyone looks up at the sky in disbelief.

-Magic of a king!

Raining meteors.

It had become a symbol of the devil to humanity, to all who remembered that day.

For all who saw that day on the ecliptic, it was a spell of apocalypse.

-Here comes the king's magic!

The reason for the despair, however, is that the voices of those who see the magic in the symbol of the devil are not hopeless.

-quagga-quagga-quagga!

That's because it's being poured into monsters, not humanity.

"Yeah......."

If you need to.

In this situation.

If you have to do it in front of people who are running away screaming betrayal.

Is there only one thing I can do?

The helmet is off.

It's back to its not-so-sleepy self.

A pair of horns.

Archdemon.

In the guise of a ballet.

and summon it.

-Woof!

In my right hand, I have Tiamata.

Alsbringer in the left hand.

No need to say anything.

Everyone just needs to see it.

It can no longer be the devil disguised as a single soldier.

-Oh, oh.......

-aah.......

Those in close proximity begin to freak out.

No need for words.

-Woof!

From the flames of the fires that reacted to the horsepower pushed to its limits, the heat wave that responded began to tear and burn the incoming monsters.

Run.

Into the waves of monsters.

He rushes in, now using all his strength.

You don't need a golden tiara.

-Woof!

Ruinous corruption pours from Tiamata, a sword that sheds vast darkness, tearing monsters apart, and blue magic pours from Alsbringer, ovipositing them.

And the flames from Hwayo's flame burn the monsters, clearing the way.

Gone are the days of the emperor's betrayal.

-Wang Yi.......

-The king is here!

People started chanting about the rise of the devil.

And that the word "devil" could have such a hopeful ring to it.

Somehow, even in this situation.

It felt ridiculous.
