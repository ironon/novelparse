            Episode 254.





Ellen filled Harriet in on everything that had happened so far. From Reinhardt's strange behavior, to the assassination attempt that began, to the confirmation of it today.

Herriot was horrified that Ellen had seen with her own eyes a bug controlling a man.

"I can't believe there's a real human kite......."

"Are you going away?"

Ellen scratched her head, wondering if she'd ever heard of kite poetry.

"I mean, in the guts of an insect....... Ugh. Ugh......."

Herriot's face turned white as he tried to put the explanation he'd heard from Christina into his own words.

"Anyway, there's a bug like that......."

"Is that magic too?"

"No, it's just the way it is......."

"That's interesting."

It's a bizarre logic that if there are bugs that control insects, there can't be bugs that control people with magic, but it's not entirely unconvincing, as long as they exist.

The strand was caught by alchemy, not black magic.

Of course, it's not that it can't be black magic, but if the alchemy uses a black magic form, it could be a black magic type of alchemy, so it's not completely unrelated.

The first clue, what the heck is the magic in the parasite, will tell us something.

There are no guarantees. But that's all we can do for now.

"Let's go see Mr. Mustang."

"Yes."

Ellen and Harriet decide to go see the teacher first, since they're still students and might not know what they're talking about.



* * *

Royal Class teachers don't have dedicated classes. They focus on the protection and care of their classmates. In addition, they are highly skilled and can act immediately in case of an emergency.

These are teachers who can teach a class, but are more focused on managing a royal class.

So, while the preceptors live in the dormitory, the classroom teachers live in the temple, so when there is an incident, they are called to the dormitory, even if it's a weekend.

"He's funny."

"Really?"

On the way to the faculty's living quarters, Herriot had this to say about Ms. Mustang.

Mr. Mustang is not an alchemist, but he is an advisor to the Magical Research Society. He occasionally drops by to watch the children work and offer a word or two of advice.

But the research assignments are overwhelming, and she finds herself hugging her problems and cringing for hours next to her kids.

And with a look of defeat on my face, I'm an incompetent teacher....... with a defeated look on his face.

Mr. Mustang's self-esteem has been at an all-time low lately.

After visiting the faculty housing complex inside the Temple, she went to Ms. Mustang's address and called her.

Then I told him what I wanted.

Bugs that control people, can you make something like that with alchemy?

"Guys, you can't build that, eh eh eh!"

Mr. Mustang, a nervous wreck, sagged, holding onto Herriot.

Ellen could see why Harriet had described Ms. Mustang as funny.

Mr. Mustang calmed down when I told him I didn't know the details, but I was just curious.

After ordering drinks at a nearby cafe, they sat down to eat.

"A manipulative homunculus or chimera....... Why do you want to know that?"

Mr. Mustang looked concerned.

"I just thought I heard somewhere that there was such a thing."

"Is there such a thing?"

"Well....... If there is such a thing, it's probably forbidden to use any kind of magic, and there's very little information about it. We don't even know if it's there or not."

Being a teacher was no different.

"Even though....... It's a bug that can control people....... I don't think anyone's ever tried to build something like that."

Still, Mr. Mustang knew the madness of mages better than his students. There are those whose pursuit of knowledge has degenerated into madness, those who dabble in sobriety. There are more unknowns than knowns.

"I trust you guys aren't trying to do this, but you must never touch the old woman when she's talking to you. Understand? It makes it harder for us to protect you."

"Of course not, and Ellen here isn't even a magic major."

"Sure, but......."

Mr. Mustang was a nervous wreck, and he was very worried that the children were having strange thoughts. Ms. Mustang saw the expressions on Ellen and Harriet's faces and smiled at them.

"He's fine. I don't know what he's worried about, but if he is, the sobriety hunters won't leave him alone."

Bounty Hunter.

At that, Ellen and Harriet shook their heads.

This is because they are both new to me.

"Sobriety hunters?"

"What is that?"

"Oh, sure. No wonder you don't know. It's no good knowing, and it's no good......."

Mr. Mustang lowered his voice.

"Have you ever heard of a magic coven?"

"Yes, I know there is such a thing."

Neither Harriet nor Ellen knew the specifics, but they knew there were such groups.

"It's one of those magical societies, hunters of mages who use sobriety."

"......Mr. Mustang, please do not pass on unclear information to your students."

Ellen and Harriet turned around at the sudden sound of a familiar voice behind them.

"Eh, Dr. Effinghauser?!"

As always, the cold-faced Effinghauser stared down at the three of them. He was dressed in casual clothes, not his usual suit. Ellen and Harriet were staring at him like he was some kind of strange animal.

Of course, the attire was different, but the attitude was the same.

Mr. Mustang blushed, as if he'd been caught in the act of a naughty prank.

"Well, there are sobriety hunters!"

But the look on his face is that of a child believing in a legend.

In fact, stories about sobriety hunters are the stuff of legend. Mr. Mustang just likes to tell these stories. He's the polar opposite of Mr. Effinghauser.

"It should be ......."

"Is that ......?"

"But don't go around talking about it. You're not even a known entity."

Dr. Effinghauser bought a drink and walked away.

"...... You're being unexpectedly verbose."

Herriot said the experience of meeting Effinghauser in passing and becoming acquainted was exciting.

"Ha, ha, ha....... Actually, he doesn't talk to me at all after work except for work. I think today is the first time this year......."

To say he's cordial would be an understatement; he doesn't seem to share his personal life with anyone except for professional reasons.

Still, it's almost the end of the year.

When I told her that this was the first time I'd spoken to her outside of work, she was stunned.

Shouldn't the construction be that thorough?

Herriot thought to himself.

"What's so great about being a sobriety hunter?"

Ellen's question made Ms. Mustang break out in a cold sweat.

"Well, I don't know....... Actually, I don't know much about it either....... I mean, it's not like they're known for anything bad, like the Black Order."

"I've heard of that."

Herriot nodded.

"They only do bad things with magic."

"They're sociopaths."

Unusually for Mr. Mustang, he used such harsh language. While all magical societies are secretive, and there are rumors and exaggerations about the few that are known, the Black Order has something in common.

They're all full of examples of how they've harmed the world. From assassinations, to using entire villages as their testing grounds, to a local lord's wizard actually working for the Black Order and trying to wipe out his entire estate.

Their purpose is unknown, but they do harm to the world.

However, as with any magical organization, neither the Sobriety Hunters nor the Black Order are fully fleshed out.

"Anyway, if you guys want to learn more here, you're going to have to see someone who majored in alchemy rather than me."

She pulled out a notepad and wrote down the address and name of the classroom.



[Aaron Mede].



"He teaches alchemy at the Temple. He teaches a class of advanced students, so I'm sure he knows how to do it, and if he doesn't, there's no such magic. He's a dedicated teacher, so he's probably not at Temple right now, since it's the weekend."

An alchemist recommended by Mr. Mustang. That would be enough knowledge. Normally, they would have waited for a weekday, but now Ellen and Harriet were in a hurry.

Information is urgent.

Herriot said urgently.

"Can I come to your home address and see you?"

"Mmmm....... I don't know if you'll see me, but....... Try not to be rude. He's a nice guy, but it's still not polite to show up on a weekend, you know?"

At Ms. Mustang's concerned gaze, Ellen and Harriet nodded.



* * *



"That's for sure."

"We may not know for sure, but we do know that you tampered with the liquor, even if you didn't intend to degrade it. If we find out, there's no escaping the penalty."

I nodded, listening to Sarkhegar's report. In my private room in Temple Dormitory, Sarkegar relayed his findings to me.

"Wizards can do a lot in a short amount of time, so running away shouldn't be a problem."

The mansion of Aaron Mede, the Temple's alchemy teacher, is not very large, but the grounds are.

I wouldn't call the mansion itself rustic, but it's more than a match for other mansions.

Rather, there are substantial underground facilities. Facilities for the study of many forbidden arts. I saw something that resembled an earthworm wriggling before my eyes.

Gross.

It looks a lot like a lotus, but it's chic.

The sparrow bit some kind of earthworm, and I wondered if it wasn't a sarkegar.

"You planted this on people to try to kill me with your hands......."

"It's a homunculus."

"Yes, magical creatures. Fortunately, they don't seem to be able to get through the temple entrance....... It can get through the air."

It takes one dispel to cross the temple entrance. Homunculi are magical creatures, and the best way to deal with them is with dispel, not swords.

But Sarkhegar has taken to the air. The homunculus is still alive because it's unaffected by the dispel.

Apart from trying to kill me, Aaron Mede is a man whose death would be good for the world. Perhaps it was not Aaron Mede himself who was the assassin that day, but the man possessed by the worm.

Maybe they saw that I noticed and decided to be cautious for now.

He is not a teacher in the Orbis class, which is why he is still in the Temple.

But killing me directly inside the temple is a lot of work.

So there I was, outside the temple, with someone else trying to kill me.

"What do you want to do, I can take care of it myself, degradation."

I told him to investigate, but not to take action, so he reported it. If I had said nothing, he would have killed Aaron Mede on the spot.

"I'll have to go there myself."

"I don't see why you need to, you can use my hands, or Elise's, or Loyar's."

The beast has been identified.

So there's no need to squeeze.

"No, I'd like to ask you a few questions in person."

I found the one who tried to kill me.

Killing it was a no-brainer, but I had a few questions before I did.

I jumped out of my seat.

"Come on, Sparrow."

"......."

Sarkeghar looked a little pouty, but then meekly turned into a sparrow.





255





The Temple's dedicated alchemy teacher. Aaron Mede is in a bad mood.

There are classes among teachers. He was a teacher who taught only the elite among his students, and as such, the students who attended his lectures were among the best in the Orbis class, or even in the general class.

Personally, I don't like Royal Class. I've seen too much arrogance based on talent alone.

Technically, I don't dislike the Royal class, but I do like the Orbis class.

I like their desperation.

I love that attitude that you can do anything to achieve something better than what you have now.

That kind of desperation clouds insight, and when you gently reach out to them through that clouded insight, they usually fall for it.

The best minds in the empire, where you can get your hands on the possibilities.

A replenished living lab where you can test your performance in real time.

The Temple is the only one on the continent.

However, the cradle disappeared in one fell swoop.

A royal class madman named Reinhardt's sudden rampage has led to this.

Technically, the real culprit is a bunch of students and teachers in Orbis' class who got together and did something weird, but even so, the real culprit is a guy named Reinhardt.

The place that supplied him with his test subjects, especially his most capable ones, had suddenly disappeared.

Whoever messed with my experiment.

You can't do anything about the mass mayhem caused by the Orbis class.

So, it was lighthearted.

I wanted to do it outside of the temple, as there was a risk that dying inside the temple would cause too much trouble.

I used Order's sobriety there because I was confident I wouldn't get caught.

No matter how strong a knight you are, if you get stabbed in your sleep, you're going to die.

No matter how good you are, you're still a student. It's not easy to kill them, they're cheap.

It also made sense because if he died, it would be the Orbis class that would be suspected, not him.

I am invisible.

But somehow, the gnome recognized the presence of his worm-planted assassin. As he watched his target flee in panic, he felt the need to hold his breath.

Sensing danger, he never stepped out of the temple.

He could have killed Reinhardt inside the Temple, since he was not banned from the Temple like the teachers of Orbis' class. But he was extremely reluctant to put himself in harm's way.

You don't have to take the risk.

As long as he remains in the Temple, Reinhardt is within his reach.

You can't stay in a temple forever.

The moment you so much as crawled out of the temple, you were dead.

However, things have gotten weird.

Another student, who was with Reinhardt at the time, saw an opportunity when he stepped outside the temple.

Sneak up behind him, subdue him, and use him as a hostage to drag Reinhardt out of the temple.

Royal class, but first grade at best, I thought, stunning and kidnapping would be no problem.

Plus, he'd only use the hosts he was using, so he wouldn't have to reveal his presence.

But what the heck.

It seemed to know it was being followed, and even encouraged it.

Turns out she's the greatest monster the Temple has ever seen, though we don't know the details.

Being a wizard, I had neglected the student information for melee majors.

Luckily, the sobriety Insector he used is an Order-only trick, unknown to the rest of the world.

You can't use that to find yourself. The evidence is already gone.

An alcoholic beverage used by the Order when they secretly want to kill people.

My anger and irritation kept me from being calm.

How could I have predicted that a first-year Royal Class student would have eyes in the back of his head?

He therefore sought to find a way to kill Reinhardt that would be more certain and methodical.

By the way.

"......Bugs that control people?"

"Yeah, can you alchemize something like that?"

Having captured his host, he comes to his mansion with another student in tow.

What the hell.

Aaron Mede couldn't believe how well things were working out.



* * *



Aaron Mede didn't know about Ellen today, but he did know about magic student Herriot de Saint-Ouen.

I was more interested in Herriot than Ellen.

The famous St. Thuan family, the greatest genius in their history. Nay, perhaps the greatest genius on the entire continent.

A child with a talent for "magic" that has never been seen before in history.

He may not realize it, but Herriot de Saint-Hilaire is the center of attention among those who know him.

Of course, there's nothing close to a crush on Aaron Mede.

They are arrogant by nature.

Like the Orbis class, he loves the struggle of the unborn. He believes that the viciousness and nastiness of those who will do anything to be strong is what puts them at the top of the heap.

That's why Herriot de Sainte-Anne seems to be a human being who was born beautiful, never lacking, and therefore never desperate to improve.

He doesn't experiment on his students with power because people are evil.

Very seriously, he considers his experiment a gift.

He gives nothing to those who are not desperate. That's why Herriot is said to be the best, but he doesn't care.

It's just curious.

How this coincidence happens.

The two lures to lure Reinhardt had come to me of their own accord.

They came in royal class, introduced by Mr. Mustang.

The student in front of me, Ellen, is here after a day of running around trying to get to the bottom of a worm that has crawled out of its host.

Unaware that this is the one place you shouldn't be.

Unaware that there were hundreds of these bugs swarming in the basement of the mansion, the two students had the look of students who just wanted to ask a question.

Two students who are taking an active role in the assassination attempt on Reinhardt.

These two would be very dear friends of Reinhardt's.

It's great for bait.

The pleasure of trampling on arrogant buds of the royal class is a bonus.

"Hmmm....... I don't see anything that doesn't make sense, and if I do say so myself, alchemists are the kind of people who like to experiment whenever possible."

Not so fast right now.

When two of his students go missing after being introduced by Mr. Mustang, it is highly likely that he will be framed.

"I think I've heard of some guys using something like that......."

"Me, really?"

"......."

Harriet's expression changes dramatically at the suggestion that she might have a meaningful clue. Ellen's eyes widen slightly as well.

"It's going to take me a while to research the material, so I'll send a message to Royal Class."

"Thank you, sir, thank you!"

Send it back for now. It would be very foolish to try to do anything with it now.

"Since you're here, have a cup of tea and scratch your itch."

He pours a cup of hot tea, one for each of his two unsuspecting students.

Send it back, but insure it.

Alchemy is sometimes magical, sometimes not.

In this case, it is not added.

In other words. Dispel doesn't work.

Aaron Mede was poisoning them both.

A slowly developing poison. Symptoms will appear over a month. The cardiovascular system slowly deteriorates, and eventually the heart stops beating and the person dies.

Without an antidote, you'll die.

It's already been proven that it's a poison that not even divine power can restore.

If you're in a pinch, you can use the antidote as an excuse to lure Reinhardt in.

Insurance for that.

"Ah, yes....... Thank you."

Herriot cautiously reaches for the glass.

Drink.

Aaron Mede smiled faintly at the thought of receiving the corpse of the cocky lunatic who had ruined all his experiments in a month or so.

You have an antidote.

So he sipped the poisoned tea he'd poured without a care in the world.

Tasteless and odorless poisons cannot be detected by taste.

Ellen didn't touch the car. As if she didn't care.

Harriet took a sip of her tea, then set it down with a slight shake of her head.

"By the way, I have a question."

Aaron Mede noticed the green earrings dangling from Harriet's ears.

If it's jewelry, it's not really prohibited.

It was a pair of earrings that didn't look very classy for the Grand Duchess of the Duchy of Saint-Thuan to be wearing.

Herriot set his teacup down.

"Why do you want to know that, why don't you ask?"

Herriot felt uncomfortable.

Everyone wanted to know.

I started with myself.

When Ellen told me about it, I wondered why anyone would care about such a thing. It's a dangerous and bizarre story, even for her.

Also, from the Magical Research Society. From Mr. Mustang.

I've been asked why I'm curious about the bugs that control people.

Aaron Mede didn't ask.

That little twinge.

It's not really a problem. Aaron Mede smiled softly at Herriot's question.

"Wizards, especially students, want to know everything, so you'd be surprised how many outlandish questions I get. So now, I'm more inclined to answer whatever they ask."

"Oh, I see."

Aron Mede's answer was plausible. Aaron realized that the children in front of him hadn't even touched their teacups, and he knew they were wary.

They're not just kids and they're talented, but they're also insightful.

Aaron Mede knows that trying to force him to drink tea will backfire. Harriet looks around the manor, not at Aaron Mede, but at the manor itself.

"Also, this place....... That's weird."

Herriot looks around with a calm expression.

It's not that they see their surroundings, it's that they seem to sense the space itself.

"I don't feel any of the energy from the veins."

"Zimac? What does that mean?"

Herriot keeps getting orders from Reinhard to do ridiculous things.

They ask you to study dimensional magic, or to cast spells with mana from outside your body instead of inside.

I haven't succeeded in all of them, but I'm working on it.

Using it for magic would come later, but she had become very used to feeling and analyzing the mana in the atmosphere. It's something other mages can do, of course, but focusing on it has made her more sensitive to it.

There is always mana everywhere, just in different concentrations. Even in the same space, the density varies. It's doubtful that it's possible to use magic with uniform control over such irregularly distributed mana.

It doesn't quite reach its true goal, but the quirkiness of the place is well documented.

At the bottom of the mansion, I can't feel any mana in the veins.

It's like a giant hole in the middle of a blue ocean.

You don't know what's underground.

However, the fact that the accounts are organized to avoid exposure already speaks for itself.

"I know that this is what an arrangement created to avoid detection usually looks like."

Whatever the reason, there is a place in the basement of the mansion that is magically made so that the outside cannot see in.

"Wizards, especially alchemists, are sensitive to this sort of thing, so it's not surprising that something like this would be made, and I'm an alchemist."

Aaron Mede is an alchemist.

Alchemists need to be especially careful about security, and rightly so. You don't want just anyone to be able to peek into your laboratory. Actually, this isn't that suspicious. Herriot knows that.

What Herriot finds suspicious is the scale.

The size of the settlement is too large.

Although he is an accomplished alchemist, he has a laboratory in the basement of his mansion that goes down to a depth of about six stories.

"This is a little uncomfortable. I think you guys are here to ask questions, but is it just me or does it feel like you're interrogating me?"

Aaron Mede didn't hide his displeasure.

When I let him in, I had a feeling something was wrong and started to doubt myself.

We can't afford to let this happen.

You need to export it.

You can use it if you want to, but in that moment, all the foundation you've laid in your temple is blown away.

I tried to mess with the wrong guy and things went horribly wrong.

Herriot seemed to hesitate a bit in front of the displeased Aaron Mede.

However, Ellen, who had been silent until now, spoke up.

"Does the homunculus disappear when it is dispelled?"

"...... What a rude bunch of kids. Okay, let me answer that. The homunculus is a magical creature. If it is dispelled, it will disappear."

"...... So, if someone is possessed by the homunculus we were talking about, what happens to them when you cast Dispel on them?"

"......."

Aaron Mede's mind seemed to freeze up.

What is this guy talking about?

"Yeah....... I don't know the details, but the homunculus' parasite will either disappear or die."

Aaron Mede knows it's the latter. The homunculus' domination of its host is irreversible. If the homunculus dies, so does the dominated.

No, the moment you're dominated, you're dead.

"Why are you asking me that?"

Ellen says calmly.

"I'm going to deploy an anti-magic field all over this mansion from now on."

"......What?!"

"If anyone in this mansion is possessed by that homunculus, they're all going to be dead. If nothing happens, I apologize, I'll be disciplined, and if I have to pay damages for property damage, I will."

Anti-Magic Fields.

It is a large-scale enchantment that goes beyond area dispel to deter magic use.

A student is capable of that level of witchcraft?

Aaron Mede's eyes widened.

Herriot de Saint-Etienne was the greatest genius in the history of magic, if that's even possible.

Big deal.

These kids are about to do something crazy.

No wonder so many of the slaves in the mansion would be turned into corpses once the anti-magic field was unleashed. His expression calmed down.

"There are only assholes in royal class."

I don't like this one or that one.

Unmask or risk losing everything.

He had to resort to extreme measures.

"Die."

-Quack!

The fireball from Aaron Mede's wand was intercepted by the force field Herriot unleashed.

"......I can't believe it's really you."

"Told you so, Harriet."

Aaron Mede stares in awe at the silver sword that suddenly appears in Ellen's right hand.

"Threats work better than questions."

"Right......."

They had been suspicious of Aaron Mede from the beginning.





256





Aaron Mede was primarily surprised by the ease with which Herriot blocked his surprise offensive spell.

But the real shock came from the sword Ellen suddenly summoned.

"......?"

How is a student subject holding a holy relic of God? Aaron Mede watches in horror as one unbelievable thing after another happens.

Herriot looks at him with his force field unfurled.

"There's no way I'm already using an anti-magic field or something."

He looked like he'd been hit in the head with a hammer.

I fell for the kid's trick. No student would use such magic.

I overestimated Herriot and got nervous about the ridiculous threats, so I took matters into my own hands.

It had already happened. Aaron Mede was unmasked.

"Yeah, I don't know what you guys found me based on, but I don't think you realize you made a mistake yet."

Annuities are some of the easiest magic to steal. It can even be stolen and used by those who don't have access to magic.

That's why mages' private workshops are so secure. High-risk facilities known as dungeons are also the work of paranoid archmages.

If you want to protect something that's easy to steal, you need to make sure it's secure.

"What happens when you trespass in the 'Alchemist's House'. I'll show you."

The alchemist's workshop is the most heavily defended of all the mage's workshops.

-Bam!

"!"

"This is......!"

In a flash, Aaron Mede's body slipped behind the wall, and the door through which Ellen and Harriet had entered disappeared.

The windows were all blocked by an opaque protective crystal.

-Crack! Crack!

Numerous magical crossbows summoned from thin air were pointed at them, and violet smoke drifted from the blue magic stones embedded throughout.

Physical attacks.

Poison Fog.

Changes in the room itself.

The Alchemist's House is a dungeon, and walking into it is suicide.

Herriot laughs.

The mystery has been revealed. So there's no need to hold back now.

"I mean, you said I can't use it, not that you don't have something I can use?"

Herriot pulls the scrollbook out of her arms. At her gesture, the pages automatically open, and the scroll that slipped out of it begins to glow.

Herriot is a wizard.

Before that, it's fabulously rich.

-Flash!

Anti-magic, Anti magic field scroll triggered.



* * *



Before Harriet and Ellen enter Aaron Mede's mansion.

"I think it's over there."

"I guess so."

Ellen pointed to a mansion in the distance.

Aaron Mede's mansion was on the outskirts of the ecliptic. It wasn't quite a no-man's land with no buildings, but it was a mansion in a place where people were rarely seen.

It was a mansion that wasn't all that fancy, but it wasn't all that unassuming either.

Someone that Mr. Mustang recommended because he's an alchemist and pretty good at it, if not an introduction.

Mr. Mustang had only mentioned Aaron Mede out of academic curiosity, not because he knew there was a homunculus that actually ruled over people.

The Temple's alchemist is the one to go to in such situations.

Both Ellen and Harriet had the idea that they might be facing an uncomfortable truth.

It was odd to be so suspicious of Ms. Temple, but there was no reason not to be. They weren't playing child's play detective here; they were on a mission to find the assassin and kill him.

"What do you think?"

In response to Ellen's question, Harriet shrugged.

"It's suspicious, but....... There's no such thing as a wizard without secrets, and when you think about it, it's weirder to see a wizard who doesn't have a workshop or laboratory in the basement of his house. Granted, it's a bit large."

Herriot commented, feeling the massive magical shielding underground.

"Can't you see through it?"

"I don't know how to forcibly unlock a system of that size, but the mere fact that I'm trying to do it will be detected, and if it's not a big deal, it's a big deal. You're tampering with someone else's property."

The person you're about to meet is probably just your average teacher.

Just being cautious. Ellen assured her that everything would be fine, but that she would be prepared, and she also brought the scroll her father had given her to use in case something happened.

The magic contained in this scrollbook, which can only be opened with your biometric information, is beyond imagination. To put it mildly, the scrollbook itself contains the destructive power of an entire army of mages.

The value is priceless.

"Let's take a peek and apologize if it's not."

At Ellen's suggestion that she try an all-or-nothing approach, Harriet got fed up and put the earrings Reinhardt had given her on both sides of her head.

Herriot sighed, feeling slightly calmer.

"Can this end with an apology......."

"What if it doesn't end with an apology?"

Herriot is convinced by the nonchalant way Ellen says it.

Somewhere along the way, Ellen is becoming a little more like Reinhardt.



* * *



It's a monster.

Aaron Mede couldn't get it out of his head.

Anti-magic fields neutralized magically-activated traps and facilities.

It's not omnipotent magic in the first place. An anti-magic field can't neutralize all magical devices. But the level of magic used was too high. This scroll was used by the Grand Duchess of St. Thuan, a duchy known for its magic.

The magic was not the same as normal scrolling.

Okay, let's say that's a possibility.

But Aaron Mede's mansion is not without its mechanized traps.

They still work.

-Bang!

-Bang!

-Bang! Quack!

A monster advances, taking traps in its stride and smashing anything in its path.

He found himself in the bizarre situation of being on the run from his mansion.

A student, bathed in enchanted blue flames, crashes through the wall and rushes forward.

Just bumping into it with your body will shatter the wall.

If it doesn't break, cut it off with the sword.

Shingon Ramen.

A holy relic of the moon god Mensis, said to have a blade as cold and sharp as moonlight.

Aaron Mede was about to realize the power of the Relic in a way he didn't want to experience.

How is that different from a Swordmaster? His attacks don't work on magically enhanced flesh, and a holy object replaces the Swordmaster's proprietary Auror Blade.

-Thump! Thump!

Aaron Mede runs away from Ellen, who bursts in when she can't see the door.

And even though he couldn't see where he'd run off to, he seemed to sense it and follow in the right direction.

You could use the teleportation scroll to escape, but the anti-magic field the damned Archduchess has cast is blocking you from using magic. So she can't use magic either, but what's following you now is a monster that has nothing to do with magic.

The users of the mansion may not have been Swordmasters, but they should have been able to stall for time. They were all down before the anti-magic field activated.

Before he knew it, Aaron Mede was in his basement workshop.

The same goes for the underground workshop: all of the homunculi being studied are either gone or have ceased to function.

Aaron Mede walked into the underground workshop.

The homunculus wasn't the only one there.

"......."

After smashing open the locked reinforced door to the underground workshop, Ellen watches as her body emerges from the blue flames of her own flesh.

Lots of weird experiments in the port.

Chimeras are still alive. Things that are made from life, things that inspire awe at the mere sight of them.

Some of them included humans. There were chimeras that were created by splicing together the human and the non-human.

There are humans, and other parts that look like, well, demons.

"You."

Ellen looks at Aaron Mede in a spark of magic.

"He deserves to die."

Apart from this, Ellen is determined to kill Aaron Mede.

"Hmph, hmph......."

Aaron Mede's underground workshop was built beneath the mansion's sprawling grounds.

It's very large, and there are many experiments.

An experiment that is unaffected by the anti-magic field.

Chimera.

-Bam!

Aaron Mede pulls the lever to open the port and release the Chimera.

-Crack....... Krrrr!

Some have great combat skills, some don't.

But it's enough to buy you some time.

Ellen sees creatures writhing and screaming in front of her, their lives mangled by other people.

Ellen looked pitifully at the hopeless creatures.

Aaron Mede runs his underground workshop.

As long as it is out of the anti-magic field, it will teleport away.

He ran toward the secret exit of the underground workshop.

“캬아아아악!”

Ellen stared at the dozens of chimeras closing in on her.

That, too, for a while.

-skuck!

"......."

Ellen began to chop up the chimeras without hesitation.

Beside me was Sarkegar, in sparrow form, and Eleris, hiding behind her invisibility spell.

I'm not sure what's going to happen, so I've brought in all the available power except for Loyar. Aaron Mede is an alchemist, but I don't know what he'll do.

The way in is not the front door.

"This is a secret passageway?"

-Yes, degradation.

Sarkegar, in the form of a sparrow perched on my shoulder, said.

It's really weird because it sounds like a bird when it's chirping cute, but when it's talking, it has an unidentifiable, dark voice.

What is.

A great dark being, but a sparrow.

I feel like I'm walking around with something like that.

It was a mansion built on a sparsely populated estate on the outskirts of the ecliptic, and the secret passage was in the middle of a forest even more remote than that.

In the lush vines of the hillside, hidden by the fallen leaves, you can see what looks like an iron gate if you look closely enough.

Enter this location and catch Aaron Mede unawares inside the mansion.

-The atmosphere is a little weird, like something is going on.......

Just as she was about to say that, Elyse, who is hiding behind an invisibility spell.

-Grrrr

The immovable iron gates opened, and out of them leaped a man with an urgent look on his face.

"......?"

"!"

He looked at me, standing there nonchalantly outside, and his heart literally stopped.

"Yeah, how could you!"

"......What is it?"

I don't know Aaron Mede's face because I've never actually seen him.

-Aaron Medeiros.

So, it was Sarkozy's explanation that made me realize that.

That goofy-looking middle-aged guy is Aaron Mederanda.

"......Why is he coming out of here?"

-Don't know.

I don't know what it was, but Aaron Mede was in front of me.

And Aaron Mededo was like, why did you get out of here?

He looked at the talking sparrow, at me waiting at the exit of the secret passage, and pondered. He seemed to have given up thinking.

He puts his hand in yours.

"Where."

-Bam!

I drove my fist into his abdomen as he tried to pull a fast one.

"Off you go!"

"I don't know what it is, but it's an asshole."

I grabbed him by the hair as he lay limp on the floor.

"You're going to be responsible for what you do from now on, aren't you?"

"Blah blah blah!"

Me and Ellen.

You didn't kill it, but you'll get what you came for.

Very expensive.

And.

-Bang!

The sound of harsh spurs on the iron gate, and someone else popped out.

"Ha ha....... Ha ha......."

With a ragged gasp, Ellen emerged, flesh and blood splattered all over her body. Looking desperate, Ellen looked back and forth between Aaron Mede, who had fallen and was holding her head, and me, and then froze.

"...... Reinhardt?"

"......Why are you coming out of there again?"

What the heck is going on?

Not Ellen, not me, not even Aaron Mede.

Even Sarkegar and Elise, though they can't speak.

We were all confused by the situation.
