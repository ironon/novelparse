            Episode 578.





The will of the gods is beyond human comprehension.

The gods see farther and wider than we do.

And.

The idea that gods must be for the good of humans may also be a preconceived notion or misconception that has arisen from a long history of faith.

What the gods think is good may not be what we think is good.

If the destruction of humanity is good for the gods, then they may want it.

So, the gods may wish for the destruction of man.

Ludwig was stunned by Rowen's words.

There are believers and priests who have betrayed Tuan and Als.

But those who left weren't the only ones who changed their minds.

Those who remained could only endure if they changed their minds.

I had to change my mindset to keep the faith.

"That, that....... If the gods want something like that....... then why the hell are you helping people?"

"It's an assumption, it's not the truth."

The will of the gods is the realm of the inscrutable.

"I'm just doing what I can in my position."

Rowen doesn't know what the will of the gods is, but he does his best.

If you want to be destroyed, you will be destroyed.

If there's a good ending to this, we'll just have to wait for it.

"If everything is the will of the gods, then this behavior is part of that will, so I'm just doing what I think is my part."

It doesn't mean that I can do whatever I want because my actions are part of God's will.

It means doing the best you can.

Wander the refugee camps, purifying them, pouring water on the poison that lies beneath.

The mindset is that of a madman, but the behavior is that of a saint.

But there's also the danger of self-rationalizing that it's okay to do anything.

The logic that my actions are all subject to the will of the gods is, in effect, to assign responsibility for everything I do to the gods.

Ludwig felt both offended and sublime at the priest in front of him.

"I personally hope this all comes to a good end, but if it doesn't, I guess it's just the way it is."

It's more like resignation, but not giving up on action.

If the gods wish for destruction, we must accept it without resenting them.

It was pure faith, without a shred of doubt.

"I'm....... I'm not sure."

Ludwig could not understand the gods, of course, nor could he understand Lowen, whose faith was so pure as to be extreme.

Rowen looked at Ludwig and smirked.

"These are chaotic times, so it's natural to feel confused."

The good news.

Rowen's point was that he wasn't a fanatic who was angry that others didn't understand or affirm his beliefs.

"It's cold out, shall we turn around?"

"Oh....... Yeah."

That's it for today's to-do list.

Somewhere along the way, Ludwig and Rowen heard the sound of horses' hooves.

Not one, not two, but a group of steeds.

Ludwig and Rowen scrambled to the side of the road to avoid the approaching horses in the distance.

A group of guards on dozens of warhorses rides up the main street of the refugee camp.

Guards patrolling the area don't ride steeds.

And Ludwig could see the manes of the horses, the armor of the guards, and the stains of blood on their helmets.

It's a sign of battle.

People on the street duck into the shacks. Rowen watches the scene and says, "I'm sorry.

"It's a slaughterhouse."

"Oh....... They're......?"

"Yeah, thanks to them, the monster problem is gone."

What Ludwig wanted to do.

Culling squads to deal with monsters outside the ecliptic.

Without a word, Ludwig stared blankly at the guardsmen riding silently by on their warhorses, not casting a single glance at the refugees.

I'd rather have that job. Killing monsters didn't require much thought, and they seemed to be far removed from the normal duties of guards, as if they only needed to be involved in mopping up.

It doesn't have to be a death squad.

Something you don't have to think about.

If only I could keep doing what I'm doing today.

With that in mind, I couldn't help but look at the back of my head.

"Shall we go?"

Rowen tugged on Ludwig's sleeve.



* * *



Rowen and Ludwig returned to the Guard and reported that the cleanup was complete. They could now lift the blockade on the plague epicenter.

But what's the point, Ludwig thought, and he couldn't get it out of his head.

Priests are scarce, and plagues continue to break out.

Even if it's not a plague, the slightest chill from the cold is enough to kill you.

Ludwig even seemed to understand Lowen a little bit.

She's the one who travels to the refugee camps to clean them up and drive out the plague.

She knew best that it would solve nothing. In her despair, Rowen could only bear it if she thought there was meaning to it all.

But she couldn't see how this despair could possibly lead to anything good.

It made me think that the gods might abandon us.

If the gods had abandoned us, we could only keep our faith in the idea that we had to affirm it.

Ludwig couldn't help but feel sorry for Rowen, who had seemed so strange, as he realized that perhaps he had become that way out of the deepest despair of all.

'Maybe that's why.......'

So I asked.

What the devil is like.

How evil they really are.

He asked because the nature of the demon would give him some idea of the will of the gods.

"Ludwig, why don't we go back to the ecliptic together, we're on the same road anyway."

"Oh, yeah. If you don't mind, I can send you an email at......."

Ludwig felt that the frail-looking priest was a candle that would be extinguished by the slightest winter breeze.



* * *



Leaving the Refugee Zone and returning to the ecliptic.

In fact, Ludwig did nothing today. He simply walked beside Rowen for a while, keeping an eye on his surroundings, ready for any eventuality.

But the fatigue was worse than yesterday.

Seeing the horrors was like seeing them yesterday, but the emotional toll was higher.

That the gods might wish for man's destruction.

That the idea that the Five Great Gods are for the benefit of humans may be wrong.

The words confused Ludwig.

"Are you going to a different zone tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow, I'm going to come back to District 17 to make sure the epidemic has really stopped, and then I'm going to District 15, and then I'm going to District 6, and then I'm going to....... I'll have to go check that out, because I'm sure there's more places I need to go. The list goes on."

"Aren't you tired?"

"Priests who can use their healing powers are far removed from the notion of being exhausted. Mental fatigue is inevitable, but when you think of the people who need to get through the day, you can't afford to be that hard on them, can you?"

"......I see."

Ludwig couldn't help but notice that Rowen wasn't sleeping well, even though she hadn't mentioned it.

Even though we were out of the epidemic zone, the refugee camps were not much different.

I see the same despair everywhere.

"Guard work. You're not used to it, are you?"

Ludwig couldn't help but shake his head at Rowen's words.

"My expression says it all....... in my face."

"Yeah, because he's so different from the other guards."

Ludwig would have been an oddity to Rowen, as he would have been escorted by guards who treated refugees like bugs.

"Mr. Ludwig."

"Yes, Priest."

Rowen looks at Ludwig.

"If you don't mind my asking, may I have you guard me again tomorrow?"

"Is that ......?"

Tomorrow, Rowen would go to a different sector, and the other guards would be manned.

"You know, the guards are....... kill people too easily."

"......a."

"It's painful to watch."

So far, I've been traveling around the refugee camps, and it hasn't been without its problems.

Rowen had seen escort guards make extreme choices in extreme situations.

Ludwig is not used to this, even if he pretends to be, and is reluctant to kill people.

He was even relieved when I told him to take her and run if anything happened.

Rowen knows Ludwig won't do anything extreme, so she asks him to escort her.

Ludwig hesitates.

Part of me wanted to nod coldly, but I wasn't sure if I could really help Rowen.

"Nothing happened today, but....... I wonder if a body like this can protect a priest in times of real danger......."

"You said you were confident."

"......."

"You can also do enchantments, shouldn't that be enough?"

We're not fighting, we're just picking it up and running.

Ludwig had nothing to say to Rowen's words.

People are precious, and Ludwig is, by definition, a precious person.

And Rowen is a valuable resource.

The priest who cleanses the plague, the one who guards it.

It doesn't matter how much of a band-aid it is, it's necessary.

It's not like you're fighting a dangerous monster, as Bertus and others worry. Your escort would rather run away if something goes wrong.

It's not risky, and there's little room for value judgment.

Soon.

It's safe to say that this is the most positive thing that has happened to Ludwig to date.

I admire the work of a martial artist because it's a no-brainer.

Similarly, this is a no-brainer and something people need to do.

"I'd have to get permission from the captain of the guard, but....... I see no reason not to."

"I'm so happy for you, Ludwig."

Ludwig smiled awkwardly at Rowen's wry smile.

By the way.

Today.

We've talked about it a lot.

In those words.

Did I mention I know how to do disenchantment?

Ludwig said no such thing.

I had a small question.
