            Episode 477.





Charlotte discovered that Port Mokna had been suspiciously overcharging for food for quite some time.

"That's because of the survivors....... or something?"

At Harriet's question, Charlotte shook her head.

"I understand the need to have a stockpile of food for the evacuees, not just for the resident population, but even with that in mind, it's too much. We need to feed the survivors until they get to Edina." ....... Based on the data so far, Fort Mokhna is requesting more food supplies than they actually need by my calculations. This isn't just a matter of feeding combatants, it's a matter of estimating how many refugees have been in Fort Mokhna at any given time, and then estimating the amount of food resources needed, and it's always been far more than needed and consumed."

At Charlotte's words, Harriet swallowed hard.

I felt like I was seeing conflicts that shouldn't be there.

"So you're saying that Port Mokna is....... are siphoning off food supplies from......?"

"Well, I don't know what else you can do with food in the middle of a battlefield, but....... We were getting charged for supplies more than we needed to."

"Did the field manager doing the demand forecast intentionally inflate the numbers?"

"That's a possibility, but even then, what's the point of going there? Even if you accumulate private wealth at Fort Mokna in the first place, you'd have to bring it back to Edina, and how would you get food back, and how many ships would you be able to put to private use, and even if you could, they'd probably all be rotten."

Why would I want to use stash as food, when I have to bring it to Port Mokna anyway?

It's true that some irregularities have occurred in Port Mokna.

From a self-interested perspective, it doesn't make much sense.

However, food is a very precious resource in Edina, as it is everywhere on the continent right now. That's why officials are dealt with harshly when they are caught cheating on food.

Charlotte stares at the papers and numbers in front of her.

"Hmmm......."

Something is wrong.

To be precise, there is something that has been a problem for a very long time.

But neither Reinhardt nor Herriot realized this was a problem. They didn't realize they were being charged more than they needed to be.

Even if you do, it doesn't make a difference.

Because it's a battlefield, and there might be a contingency, and you're trying to stockpile a lot of food.

Trust Riana, that's what you've been doing all this time.

Because there's no such thing as doubt.

Charlotte isn't the only one who suspects Riana of foul play.

But the numbers are weird.

The numbers, on paper, are showing strange values on average.

If you're seeing strange numbers on average for a long time, it's a pretty good indication that something strange has been going on for a long time.

Reading negativity and suspicion between the lines.

What was impossible for Reinhardt and Herriot was possible for Charlotte.

But problem.

It's about investigating corruption that may have involved one of Reinhardt's most important people, Liana de Granz.

Even if there is nothing wrong with Lyanna, investigating Port Mokna is investigating her faction.

If necessary, there should be punishment.

Are you authorized to do so.

"......."

That's why Charlotte asked Reinhardt before she left.

Be clear about your authority and its scope.

Reinhardt didn't ask Charlotte to do it, he ordered her to.

Bend it somehow.

As Regent of Edina, Charlotte must do what Reinhardt tells her to do.

If there is fraud, it should be investigated, and if punishment is necessary, it should be carried out.

If Riana refuses to listen to Charlotte's instructions and commands, she must be made to listen.

"I need to go to Port Mokna."

I wouldn't have made this decision if Reinhardt had told me not to touch you.

But Reinhardt told him to do it, so he has to do it right.

Charlotte thought so.

Fort Mokna is garrisoned by the Paladins of the Holy Order, whose leader is Rianada.

Their main task is to defend Fort Mokna, first, and secondly, Riana herself will set out on expeditions to nearby areas to rescue refugees fleeing or hiding from the monsters.

The number of people Riana has saved so far is hard to fathom.

However, Riana now believes that Fort Mokna has lost much of its strategic value. She wants to build another base and use it as a staging post.

In fact, while they had initially been able to rescue a fairly large number of evacuees, it was now becoming very difficult to find survivors in the neighborhood.

That's why, unlike in the early days, no matter how much you explore and go on expeditions, no more than a thousand people are rescued.

It's a cruel thing to say, but it would have meant that the people who were still alive were almost all dead.

The number of people you can save has already been stretched to the limit, and even if you move your base, you won't be able to find as many survivors as before.

Fort Mokna, the obsolete forward base.

Charlotte and Herriot arrived in Port Mokna via mass teleportation from Lucinil, the House of Demand resident in the castle.

"This is....... Port Mokna......."

Charlotte felt something different when she saw the place she knew on paper.

There were quite a few people living in this base.

However, it was not a residential area, but rather a place to temporarily house evacuees, as well as a key military presence.

There was a general sense of tension in the city, as battles were a daily occurrence.

"Refugee camps are....... almost empty."

"Yeah....... It's getting harder and harder to find survivors now."

At Charlotte's words, Harriet nodded.

There were a few evacuees who had somehow been rescued, but the numbers were in the two hundred range at best.

The base wasn't that big because the larger the base, the more it had to defend.

It was a place where only necessary buildings existed, including barracks for troops, shrines for paladins to pray in, smoke-filled dining halls, and massive warehouses.

The harbor was also quite large, with large ships coming and going.

"This is a place where negative accumulation can't exist."

"Yeah, I mean......."

Only when she saw it with her own eyes did Charlotte realize that there was no room for selfishness in this place.

Lucinil, the Gaju of Demand who had come along for the transfer, also stared out over the landscape of Port Mokna.

"Get back to work. I'm going to hang around here a bit."

"Yes, my lord."

Lucinil said he was going for a walk and started walking somewhere in the Samangsaban.

At Temple, I thought he was just a junior who had gotten along with Reinhardt strangely quickly, but it turns out he's an older Lord Vampire.

Charlotte and Harriet both stare at the back of Lucinil's head, now a member of the Senate.

Despite the situation.

Looks like a child, but is actually a road vampire.

Sometimes I stop to think about what I'm doing, sometimes I stare at something.

After idly following Lucinil's dazzling silver hair, Charlotte looks straight ahead, as if remembering what she's come to do.

"We don't need to hide the fact that we're here. Let's go to the command center."

"Yes."

Herriot clenched his fist slightly.

I didn't know what the conversation would be, but I knew that Riana's personality wouldn't allow her to say anything nice.

That's why Charlotte's response is so important.



* * *



"Your Excellency, the King is currently on an operational deployment. He is expected to return sometime today, but we do not have a specific time."

"Then we'll wait until you return."

Upon arrival at the command center, Charlotte was informed that Riana was out of town. Harriet and Charlotte sat in the command center parlor and waited for Riana to return.

Atop the thick walls surrounding Fort Mokna, paladins stood guard at regular intervals. They were on constant alert, never knowing when or where the monsters would strike.

Since this is basically where most of the fighting happens, you could feel the tension in the room.

Not only does he command them, but he is also tasked with periodically patrolling the neighborhood to exterminate monsters, as well as traveling farther afield to rescue survivors.

Charlotte is a numbers person, but she also doesn't think numbers are everything.

There are some things you just have to see to believe.

Or the overall tension at Fort Mokna, or the way all the troops are tucked in.

Some things can't be expressed in numbers, they have to be seen to be believed.

That's what Charlotte concluded after checking out Port Mokna to some extent.

"I think Riana has too much on her plate."

Liana de Granz has a lot on her plate.

"Yes. That's why sometimes Riana's missions are....... Olivia takes over for a few days."

"Ah....... That could work."

Olivia Ranze, Prelate of the Holy Order.

She also has a lot of power, so if Riana's fatigue seems to be too much, Olivia can take over.

"You've been working so hard, and you're only taking a few days off?"

"Yeah, Riana wanted that....... She says she's a little sore from resting......."

With no one else available to replace her, Riana has become a permanent fixture at Fort Mokna. Charlotte crosses her arms and stares out at the view of Fort Mokna.

"Was Reinhardt a frequent visitor to Fort Mokna?"

"No, you know....... Reinhardt has a lot of work to do, so he doesn't come to Fort Mokna very often, but he did make an inspection last time."

It was a crudely built house, and Reinhardt didn't even have time to sleep while he got some of Edina's systems in place. He even received death threats.

"Hmmm......."

"Why, does something seem off to you?"

"Oh, no."

Charlotte shook her head.

"In effect, Riana has full control of Port Mokhna....... I was just thinking about that."

"Yeah, that's right. Riana tends to make most of the decisions and work things out here, though we do talk about the really important stuff."

"What if it's really important?"

"Primarily, how are we going to transport evacuees. How are we going to set up new operational zones?"

Charlotte nodded at Harriet's words.

"What is the loyalty of the troops at Fort Mokna to Lyanna?"

"Loyalty?"

"Yes, loyalty."

At Charlotte's question, Harriet ponders.

"It must be very high. I've heard that Riana always fights at the front of the line, and when monsters attack, even in the middle of the night, she tries to be the first to do as little damage as possible. If the commander fights at the front of the line....... can't her loyalty be low?"

"I see."

Charlotte is still looking out the window.

Liana de Granz puts her all into the defense of Fort Mokna.

He fights from the front to avoid taking as many casualties as possible. Trust and loyalty to such a commander cannot be low.

Charlotte was convinced by Herriot's words.

"How does it compare to Olivia Lanchester?"

"Huh?"

The out-of-the-blue question left Herriot a little flustered.

"Is it possible that the paladins here are more loyal to Liana de Granz than to Olivia Ranze, the head of the Holy Order?"

"That's....... That's a dangerous question. Charlotte."

It was a very sensitive question. In essence, they are all under the command of Olivia Ranze, the High Priestess of the Holy Order, with Liana de Granz as their commander.

If they are more loyal to Liana de Granz than Olivia over time, that might be an issue.

Charlotte stares at Harriet, who is reluctant to answer.

"It's a risky question."

"......."

"It's dangerous, you need to know."

Reinhard wants Charlotte to take the place of the Devil entirely.

So, you should know all about Edina.

If something is dangerous, it's dangerous and you need to know about it, no matter how sensitive it is.

"I....... I don't know the specifics of Port Mokna or what the paladins think. But....... Riana has always fought for the people, and she's fiercely protective of her soldiers. I don't know who the paladins will be more loyal to, Olivia or Riana. ....... But... if they're for Riana....... they would lay down their own lives for her... ....... I think so."

The severity is unknown.

But the loyalty of the paladins is such that they will lay down their lives for you.

"King Thunderbolt is a title given to paladins with reverence and respect."

They even give themselves that title in honor of their commander, who is only twenty years younger than they are.

"...... is it?"

Charlotte nodded at Harriet's answer.

Herriot dreaded each of Charlotte's unspoken questions.

When Riana comes back and they start talking and things start to fall apart, there's a big problem, and that kind of problem can turn into a fight if done wrong.

A regent set up by a demon.

And a conflict with Liana, one of the Four Heavenly Kings.

It's very likely to be irreversible in many ways.

In the end, the supreme decision maker in Edina, despite not being there, is the demon king Vali.

Regardless of whether or not there really was a problem, if there was a problem and it wasn't resolved properly, the jury is still out until after the devil returns.

If the devil comes back with a problem, whose hand will he raise?

No matter whose hand you raise, it's a problem.

Raising the Regent's hand is a surefire way to antagonize Riana and her supporters.

If you raise Riana's hand, your fledgling regency will be creaky from the start. If she can't handle the authorized factions, she won't be able to take on the full responsibility of running Edina's affairs.

"Charlotte, this is....... It's too dangerous to touch."

"I know that."

At Harriet's cautious words, Charlotte merely stared out the window and said, "Yes.

Southwestern borderlands of Cernstadt.

Sren Mountains.

-Woof!

I stood still and watched as the giant tree fell and rolled away, splitting in two.

"@AndreaMcGee....... 허억......."

A cold sweat broke out all over my body.

I had no idea there was a monster disguised as a tree.

I tried to climb up and get some snow, but before I could close my eyes, the tree tried to suck me in and eat me whole.

He had somehow managed to shield and release his energy, blasting away at the behemoths, but there was no telling what would have happened if he had actually fallen asleep.

You've been in the Sren Mountains for about a month now.

I didn't sleep a wink.

We haven't found Lizaira yet.
