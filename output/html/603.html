Saviolin Tana looks at Ellen with sad eyes.

The conversation is not working.

In the end, then, there is only one recourse left to each other.

"I don't want to hurt you."

Saviolin Tana says.

"That's the same for me."

Ellen's response.

What they say to each other already shows how they feel about each other.

They revealed that they both thought they had the upper hand.

It may seem like we're crossing into the realm of childish ego battles, but after all, these are two of the most dominant players on the continent.

Is Ellen Artorius stronger, or is Saviorin Tana stronger?

"......."

"......."

They stare at each other in silence.

Eventually, they can't help but double-check their spacing.

Am I stronger.

Is the opponent stronger.

"Ellen......."

Heinrich looks at Ellen in a cold sweat.

It's one thing to know what the Empire is up to, but it's another thing entirely to have Savior Tana and Ellen cross swords with each other.

"It's okay, I'm not going to kill you."

At Ellen's arrogant remark, Heinrich, of course. Saviolin Tana smiles subtly.

"You're capable of provocation."

"......I wasn't provocative, I was just stating a fact."

Ellen says still.

"If you don't get out of the way right now."

-Woof

Ellen's entire body begins to surge with blue energy.

"Expect it to hurt."

"......."

Do not use swords.

Tana sighs at how cute that sounds.

"You mean you're not going to use holy water?"

Voidblade Lament.

Cloak of the Sun Rapelt.

The sight of them, both unarmored, about to go toe-to-toe, is rather disconcerting to Savior Tana.

"You don't need it."

"I don't think so."

Saviolin Tana scowls, as if you'd even touch my toes without the unreasonable power of a holy object.

I was trying to stop Ellen.

The arrogance of trying to stand before him without even a holy object.

Seriously, that attitude pissed off Saviolin Tana.

"I'll take that back."

Saviolin Tana tosses the umbrella she was using aside.

"If you don't back off now......."

-curl!

Saviolin Tana's entire body emanates a storm of magic that blows away the snow.

Saviolin Tana's tousled hair, having stirred up a storm with nothing more than a magical shockwave, settles into stillness once more.

Her piercing eyes glare at Ellen.

"I'll make sure you don't get out of bed until winter is over."

"Try it."

"Heck......."

-Thump!

In the rush of the moment, Savior Tana was already in front of Ellen's nose.

"You don't say a word!"

-Bam!

"......!"

一拳 (一拳).

Taking a direct hit, Ellen bounced off the street, smashing into a tree, while Heinrich and Ludwig, minus Louise, were swept off their feet in the aftermath.

"Don't be needlessly arrogant."

Saviolin Tana said as she walked over to Ellen in the woods.

"Take out the holy relic."

At Ellen's arrogance in trying to put her on equal footing without a holy object, Saviolin Tana was genuinely outraged.

In the midst of those broken trees, something suddenly flies.

'eye......?'

A snowball hurtled toward them, and Savior Tana dodged it with a quick shake of her head.

"Are you kidding me......!"

For a moment, Boogahmintana flirts with Tana.

She could already see Ellen bending at the waist through the rising dust.

Kick back.

-Quack!

"......cough!"

Struck by a wild, spinning kick, Saviolin Tana blocked it with her upper arm, but was forced to take several large steps to the side.

"I don't need it."

A calm-faced Ellen began to lunge at Tana, who had bounced away.

That moment when you're not really trying to kill each other, but it's about to become an emotional fight.

-That's it!

The fight came to an abrupt halt at the sound of a distant cry, familiar to both of them.

"......bertus."

"Your Majesty......."

The emperor was approaching in the distance, trudging through the snow.

Bertus's sudden appearance put a stop to the dogfight between two of humanity's greatest powers.

And then, without explanation or explanation to anyone, they just slipped past heavy security and sat him down in the lobby of Hogwarts.

Including Louise von Schwarz.

"......."

"......."

Ellen and Saviolin Tana stare at the floor, mouths agape.

"I told her to tie up Ellen if she tried to come in, but I don't think I told her to punch me."

"......that. I'm sorry, Your Majesty."

Saviolin Tana was about to say that she was a great player who would step down because she played well, but then she shut up.

Bertus looks at Ellen, who is speechless.

"You don't have to be so....... Yeah....... because you're not here for anything good."

Bertus looks out at the assembled group.

Ellen isn't the only one, there's Ludwig and Heinrich, and even a princess from the Empire.

Bertus looks at them, then back at Ellen.

"Do I really, really need to know?"

In the end, the emperor says the same thing that Savior Tana said.

"I'll tell you what, even if you tell me not to do it, I'm still going to do it, and nothing is going to change."

"......."

"So it's just a matter of knowing."

"You should know."

Ellen says.

"I have a duty to know."

A duty to know, not a right to know.

Bertus couldn't help but smile bitterly, for it was clear that the words spoke of the responsibility Ellen felt.

"If this isn't just a bad thing, then I want to know more. What is it doing and why is it necessary. I need to know."

When Bertus saw Ellen's unyielding attitude, he had no choice but to give up.

"......Yes."

Then, you see someone else, not Ellen.

"I'd rather not."

Louise had no idea why Bertus was looking at her and saying that.

"And let me tell you something."

Bertus looks everyone in the face and says.

"I didn't kill Rowen."

"......what?"

Just when you think it's all over, something comes out of Bertus' mouth that turns the whole premise on its head.

"Believe it or not, there's nothing I can do about it."

It's only through a series of terrible coincidences that Ellen got here.

In the first place, the theft of the remains from the Crusader underground had nothing to do with the Empire.

"So who....... killed the priest?"

Ludwig's eyes widened at the sudden sound.

We've come this far in our pursuit of Rowen's death, but unless Bertus had something to do with it, this isn't over yet.

So who the hell was Rowen murdered by?

"I don't know."

Either they really don't know, or they're pretending not to.

No one would ever know the truth.

"Calling an emergency meeting?

'Yes, the Five Popes say they have urgent business to discuss. They are gathered before the High Priest of Als.'

Elayon Bolton had now left the High Hall of the Crusaders and arrived at the High Hall of Alth.

Of the five main religions, only Als has a high temple in the ecliptic.

Since the Crusade is the center of power for the five major orders, the four popes, with the exception of the Pope of the Order of Alth, normally reside in the temples of their respective, more powerful orders.

Due to location and circumstance, it is customary for the Papal Conclave of the Five Great Houses to be held in the Great Hall of the Knights Templar. There is no better place for the symbolism and meaning.

However, the fact that the Five Great Patriarchs were holding an emergency meeting, and the location was the Great Hall of Alth, put Elayon Bolton in a pretty strange mood.

Why do you call yourself here?

But in the end, technically, the head of the Crusader Knights is subordinate to the popes.

It was Elion Bolton's duty to go where he was called.

Even so, you've got a lot on your plate.

I was also uncomfortable with the idea of not knowing what the popes were up to.

This was an emergency meeting, so there was no agenda and no attendants.

Although it had fallen from grace along with the Tuan Cult, the Daijiajie was still a formidable force to be reckoned with, and no passerby was quick to point fingers at the Daijiajie.

Elayon Bolton arrives at the Great Hall of Als alone and enters.

A conference room on the top floor of the former Great Hall of Als.

'I bequeathed people....... '.

As soon as he reached the upper levels, where there were no wandering priests or paladins, Elayon Bolton felt a chill down the back of his neck.

What we're talking about.

What's going on.

What if something happens?

After much deliberation, Elion Bolton opened the door to the top floor conference room, not so urgently, not so gracefully.

As in any conference room, there was a round table.

Unsurprisingly, the five popes are seated in the conference room. They stare at Elion Bolton as he appears.

There are five popes.

But Elion Bolton had forgotten to say yes to the popes, and his eyes were somewhere else.

In a room where there should have been only five popes, there was one more person.

Sitting in a chair, looking at himself, smiling, is Elion Bolton.

Elion Bolton, who is never fazed by anything, could not help but go white in the face.

"Elion Bolton."

"You are......!"

"Three years, maybe."

There, there was Reinhard, the devil himself.

Back in the days of human camouflage.

Reinhardt sat there impassively.

Reinhardt gestures to the chair in front of Elion Bolton.

"What are you doing? Sit down."

He sounded arrogant, like he owned the place.

The Death Knight we created.

Chimeric Homunculus undead created by the Empire.

It was a similar direction from the beginning.

We needed to resupply our Death Knights, so we needed bodies.

But at that point, we didn't realize that the Empire was doing something similar.

It wasn't until I replenished my Death Knights in the Cemetery of Saints that I began to see what the Empire was doing.

I was concerned about that, just in case.

The Crusaders follow the case and inadvertently discover what the Empire is doing.

After Bertus told me what happened, I spoke with him briefly.

"We're already tracking it, we're being careful, but you never know what's going to happen.

Naturally, the Crusaders would want to investigate what had happened in their territory.

There was no reason to cover up or hide the site in the first place.

If they find out that I'm responsible for what happened there, so what.

But in a bizarre twist, events took a turn that might lead to the Empire's best-kept secret.

We're the ones who did it, but it's the Empire that gets caught.

Soon, my actions would have a weird butterfly effect, and the empire would fall apart.

But there was nothing I could do about it, so I decided to stay in the temple and see what happened.

And Archbishop Rowen is dead.

I didn't believe Ludwig's claim that the people in the refugee camp killed Rowen in the first place, any more than Ellen did.

Ludwig and the archbishop-level priest who was working to cleanse the city of the disease are dead.

There had to be something.

Unlike Ellen, who was obviously just beginning her investigation at that point, I knew most of the truth behind the story.

The death of Archbishop Rowen is likely no ordinary occurrence.

Naturally, the first place I went was to Bertus.

Through Sarkegar, we were able to meet up with them in a way that was scary to arrange.

Bertus already knew about this.

"No?

"Yeah, it's not us.

Bertus said the events at the temple were not the work of the Empire.

"You're right about the question of whether to handle it or not.

'......Troubled?

'It's the Inquisitor. The one.'

Of course, Bertus already knew something I didn't.

'I found out yesterday, too, that Ludwig was probably approached on purpose. He can't get into the Temple, so I think he's trying to do something about it....... I'm as puzzled as you are.'

Rowen was an Inquisitor, and naturally, he was investigating what had happened to the Crusaders.

He realizes that Temple has a connection to the missing body, though it's not quite the same thing, and he gets a hold of Ludwig's ID and deliberately approaches him.

Bertus was on top of it.

The Inquisitor, eager to get to the truth, tried to use Ludwig against him.

But suddenly it died.

Bertus was equally baffled by the situation.

I, too, was thinking that it was very likely the Empire that killed Rowen.

Given that Rowen was an Inquisitor, was pursuing a case, and had the Temple in mind, the Empire had every reason to kill him to silence him.

But the empire is not the culprit.

"I'm not sure why, but it could be a purge.

"......What? Purge?

It was a moot point.

"Reinhard, listen to me.

Bertus' story was long, but the gist of it was simple.

That the Five Great Houses may have different minds.

The popes of each denomination, to be precise.

'What....... bullshit......?'

When Bertus told me that, I couldn't help but freeze.

'Are they....... getting ready to take my side?

"Maybe.

Betrayal on Bertus' part.

To me, it's either move on or surrender.

"I don't know which side the dead priest was on, but it's happened and we can't stop the flow.

'.......'

"The Order and the Crusaders might split, there might be a civil war, and that would complicate things even more.

'Then what....... What should I do?

"We have to stop them. Until this whole Gate thing is over, I'm not letting anyone bleed over this.

That was something Bertus could not do. It was something only I could do.

"Do you know what you're talking about?

At my question, Bertus smiled bitterly.

"You never know.

'.......'

I couldn't say anything.
