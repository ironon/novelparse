"You're really going back? Today?"

"Yes."

"I don't think it's that urgent, but....... I can't help it."

Ellen didn't really have anything to call baggage. The only thing she brought with her when she came here was a cat carrier.

So when I went back to the Allied garrison, I was back in my normal clothes, but I didn't have anything else to carry with me.

"The snow has just stopped, but......."

Louise couldn't help but feel bittersweet at Ellen's insistence that they go back now that the snow had stopped falling and the weather had improved.

I came back for a break, got caught up in something strange, and ended up feeling even heavier.

The Demon King has taken control of the Crusader Knights and the Five Great Houses.

And I can't even touch it.

In the face of rapidly changing times, there is no such thing as a good group, but rather a group that survives.

Something radical was about to happen, and it was going to cost an unfathomable amount of blood.

The future of the empire is cloudy, and the time has come for everyone to make a choice.

It would be more peaceful to be on the Allied side of the ecliptic, not the other way around, and that's the way to avoid getting caught up in anything more sinister, especially for Ellen.

If you can't choose anything, you might as well go where you can't see it.

It's just a bunch of unsolvable problems.

There's no telling where this will end up.

If an empire falls, and a demon fills its place.

What fate awaits Ellen, who is supposed to be the devil's arch-enemy.

And what position should Heinrich take there.

No one has the answer.

Everyone is doing something because they fear the future. We all agree that the gate crisis needs to end, but the things we're doing in the hopes that it will, are making the time afterward even more frightening.

Is it really right to make the world a hellhole for the sake of a single absolute?

So what happens to the world after that absolute is achieved?

It is more dangerous for Ellen to remain on the ecliptic.

That's why we're leaving the ecliptic.

But I'd been thinking about it for a while.

"Cat, take good care of me when I come back."

"......Okay."

But for some time now, I've been waiting for a cat that hasn't shown up, a cat that hasn't shown up when I've tried to touch it one last time and leave.

But she never shows up, so Ellen leaves, leaving Heinrich in charge.

It might have disappeared altogether, Ellen had a hunch.

I kept getting that feeling that even if we were together, he would leave at some point.

Someday, from someone, like you've always felt that way.

I don't know why, but I don't think I can help it if it suddenly disappears.

We pass by each other, stay with each other for a while, and wish we could pass by each other again.

It's a shame we won't be able to say goodbye.

Eventually.

Ellen couldn't get too attached to anything too small.

"I'll be there."

Ellen was seen off by Louise and Heinrich, and left the Temple dormitory in silence.

Louise says, watching Ellen's back as she leaves.

"I think we should go back, too."

"......I think you should."

While there are dangers everywhere, it was clear that the imperial ecliptic was now, in a sense, the most dangerous place in the world.



* * *



Not only did it stop snowing like it was a lie, but it melted quickly.

The snow accumulated for a long time, but it only took a few days for it to melt.

We've been having a string of warm days where I've wondered if it's a little too hot.

Ellen walks through the snow-melted streets of Temple.

There's not much to do in the Allied garrison, but in the ecliptic you'll learn too much that you don't need to know.

I'd rather live in ignorance if the goal is to fight anyway.

I decided that it was better to spend this winter not knowing anything than to get lost in a sea of things that were hard to think about and hard to decide.

How long can you hold on to a will that feels like it might break?

What's going on in the world.

If I couldn't go anywhere, if I was going to be forced down a path, like I was being pulled by something, I didn't want to see any paths anymore.

If it's a ship that's going to sink someday, should you abandon it?

Your empire, your own consciousness.

You're just holding on to things that will eventually fall apart.

Ending the Gate debacle should be the top priority right now, but everyone was thinking beyond that.

The Crusaders, the Empire, and countless other groups were already running through the scenarios in their heads.

One by one.

Louise von Schwarz realized that a major pillar of the Alliance, the Crusader Knights, had fallen into the hands of the Devil.

What happens when even the First Reich, Cernstadt, sides with the Devil.

An empire that has lost two of its pillars will cease to be an empire. Other empires will be forced to make a choice the moment this becomes visible.

Which side to take.

The Empire has already lost its legitimacy, and the Devil is the one who caused the Gate.

Both are groups that need to go away. But I don't think there's a megaforce that's going to rise above them.

What if the empire is isolated?

The Empire has an immortal army that can be used even if everything is lost.

We have a more powerful army than ever before.

Whether it's an empire on the verge of collapse, or the slaughter of those who sided with the devil to keep it alive.

Either way, it doesn't change the fact that we are once again at war.

"......."

And Ellen knows where she stands.

Whether victory is guaranteed or downfall is inevitable, you'll be on the side of the Empire.

It will inevitably happen, because another will will one day take its place in the place of the will that has disappeared.

So I'd rather not know.

There's no point in trying to learn something when the path is already set.

Eventually, you'll be nothing more than an undying army, doomed to be swallowed up by something.

For now, you can run away when someone pushes you to fight, but one day you won't be able to.

Like it or not, with or without someone forcing you to.

Fated to become an adversary one day, Ellen returns to the Alliance garrison to escape the aura of division and war that permeates the ecliptic.

Therein lies the only good.

The single, absolute good of ending the gate crisis.

And so, walking through the thawed streets, Ellen found herself near the entrance to the temple.

There's still no such thing as people coming and going.

But there it is, no people, but a small animal.

"......a."

I could see a black cat sitting on a nearby bench, curled up in the sunshine.

The cat turns its head to look at Ellen as she approaches.

-Angel

Ellen walks over to the cat, who is sitting on a bench and seems to be enjoying some much-needed sunshine.

It's a strange animal.

One minute it's gone, the next it's here.

Just when you think you're not coming back and give up and leave, it's waiting at the entrance as if it knew.

If you wait, it won't come.

If you give up, it will show up somewhere.

So I'm being condescending.

Somehow, I can't resist.

Ellen is squatting in front of a bench, eye level with the cat who is looking at her.

Conversations don't work.

But somehow, Ellen has always felt like she understood the conversation.

It seems to recognize my sadness.

They seem to recognize my pain.

It was like he felt my pain.

I'm sure I'm mistaken, but I don't think I am.

Like this now.

It's like he's waiting for Ellen at the entrance to the temple, as if he knows she's leaving.

Do they really know or do they not know.

I wonder if I'm giving meaning to things that are just coincidences.

Still, it's said that coincidences are inevitable.

This cat seemed to know his every thought in such a serendipitous way.

"I'm going to go."

-Angel

Ellen says a simple goodbye.

I wonder if I can come back.

When you return, what will the ecliptic look like?

It's hard to think that anything good can come of it.

Can this little animal survive the rising tide of war?

The Alliance garrison is dangerous, but the Zodiac is dangerous and the Temple is dangerous as it is.

The little guys always get swept away.

The fate of the little guys has always been that way, just as the Gate debacle only swept people away.

But.

The little guy in front of you.

Smaller beings are even smaller.

Maybe it's small, and when the wind blows, it blows, and when the waves crash, they crash.

Maybe it's just that it's too small to matter.

Ellen looked at the little black cat looking at her.

Recalling moments of great comfort in a small being.

"Goodbye."

I said, "I mean it," and kissed the bridge of the cat's nose.

"And, get out of here early."

-Angel

After one last playful slap at Honeybomb, Ellen headed for the Temple Gate.

As she exits the gate, Ellen stares up at the sky.

It's a warm day that has arrived as if to say that the bitterly cold winter is finally coming to an end.

But there was just too much snow.

With this much snow, I wonder if a day or so of warm weather will melt it all.

I've come a long way.

I'm sure there's still plenty of snow on the ground somewhere that doesn't get sunlight.

Who melts snow in the middle of nowhere?

Ellen holds the amulet still.

An amulet representing the moon and sun.

Hold it in your hand and carefully roll it around.

Exhaustion.

Sick and tired.

Maybe it's time to let go.

If it's something you're destined to fight anyway.

I wonder if this is the end of the world.

If the malice and hatred in this world will eventually create a situation that needs to be fought.

No matter what you do, no matter what you try, you're going to be forced to fight at some point.

The moment you feel like giving up.

A moment of vulnerability.

Ellen's eyes sunk deep.

Or maybe I had already reached my limit a long time ago.

It's as if you've pushed the envelope, and now you've reached a critical mass of time.

The sandbar of the ego is submerged beneath the rising waters.

-Took

All too easily, the amulet's leather straps snapped at the slightest tug.

Like when was the last time you had something so precious hanging around your neck to keep it from falling off?

Like finally breaking the shackles.

Like the beginning of something that is only now being liberated.

Ellen tosses the amulet she's been wearing aside like trash and starts walking somewhere.

It's like you've become something completely different.

As if she were now irrelevant to all the past, Ellen walked away and never looked back.

-.......

The black cat cautiously took the round amulet from the ground, and disappeared into an alley.
