It's all in the mindset, and it's actually pretty easy to get back to Edina.

Entering and exiting the temple could be done in the guise of an animal.

Not because I'm an animal, but because when I walked through the gate in the first place, I felt like it had been talked about among the guards beforehand that I was Ellen's cat.

It's like being given an intangible temple pass.

Once out of the temple, Herriot's homemade teleportation scroll would take him straight back to Edina.

It's a waste of scroll, but I can't call Heriot here because he doesn't know I was dragged to the temple in the first place.

It's not uncommon for me to disappear and return after leaving Charlotte in charge of the regency, so no one panicked.

Naturally, the first thing I looked for was Herriot.

Despite the fact that everyone else was sleeping, Harriet was in the lab, not the bedroom, looking at something.

If you don't tell him, he won't rest either.

When I showed up after being gone for a while, Herriot gave me a rundown of what had been going on in Edina.

"You were dragged to the ...... temple?"

"......."

Herriot laughed in disbelief when I told him about my experiences in the Allied lines and the current whereabouts of Cat Mode.

"Caged?"

"Uh......."

"Your pet is ready......."

Herriot said that with a hint of frustration, and I couldn't argue with him.

"But doesn't that mean you have to stay in the cat form longer?"

"I already do......."

"Ah."

"In fact, it still feels a little, well, awkward."

"...... Is that it?"

"Uh, I wonder why humans are so tall."

"...... and."

After nearly a week of low visibility, the ground seemed to tremble as I returned to my human form.

The human condition is awkward!

I told him as much as I could about what had been going on in Herriot's lab.

I thought it was just a matter of reanimating them with black magic, but Christina, an alchemist, is working on a research project.

"I can't believe there's alchemy involved......."

"I don't get it, what the hell does being an alchemist have to do with reanimating the dead?"

"In the first place, alchemy is almost as alcoholic as black magic....... In fact, the frequency of insanity is higher among alchemists than warlocks."

"...... is it?"

"Yeah, Aaron Mede, you remember him."

"...... did."

Well, actually, Aaron Mede, a lowly member of the Black Order, was an alchemist rather than a warlock.

"There's also quite a bit of alchemy associated with black magic....... So they're not necessarily incompatible magical systems, but rather related."

Is it the concept of euploidy.

It would be ridiculous to do forbidden research and touch alchemy but not black magic, or vice versa.

It's a concept that breaks all the taboos if you're doing research outside of society's morals.

That's why there's alchemy based on black magic, and there's black magic based on alchemy.

I'm sure this has something to do with it.

"So, what do you think the Empire is doing?"

Her eyes narrowed at my nonchalant question.

"How do I know that?"

"......Yeah, right."

I have this trust that when the subject of magic is thrown at you, you have all the right answers.......

That said, it also doesn't make sense that Herriot has been an answer vending machine so far.

"Too few clues, and even if alchemy and black magic are involved, it's too broad a topic."

It looks like they're doing something bad with their magic, but what magic?

That's pretty much what the question was.

"Raising the dead is alchemy......."

Herriot thought about it, but couldn't seem to come up with anything.

"In isolation, I don't know, but when I try to think about it together, it's hard."

"Separately, do you understand?"

"If it's black magic, it's alcoholic beverages related to the undead. If it was alchemy, you'd have Moonshine and other enhancement potions."

Herriot doesn't see the connection either.

"I'll give it some thought. Maybe the patriarchs will have a clue."

In retrospect, it was a little silly of me to come back in the middle of the night, not a night owl, and ask for answers.

"Are you going to go straight back to the ecliptic? You're Ellen's cat, not Reinhardt's, and isn't Ellen worried that her cat is missing?"

Herriot says, covering his mouth as if to mock me.

"Are you doing this for ......?"

"Of course."

Harriet giggled, as if she found the sight of me as a pet amusing.

"Or can you stay with me today because I'll let you go early tomorrow?"

"......?"

"As a cat instead."

"Oh, no, why not!"

Stop!

I did it wrong!

"Come on. I'll give you a hug."

Herriot comes over and opens his arms wide as if to hug you.

You!

You seem to think that I, the cat, am a completely separate creature from you.

Why are you doing the doublethink and not me?

"......, please..."

"What, you don't like me, you don't like me, you don't like me?"

"Not....... It's not like that....... You know it's not......."

"Then come on, come on!"

At some point, there is such a thing.

You'll find that you'll listen to anything our paktong says.

This isn't how we're supposed to be, but at some point it's completely reversed and I can't do anything about it!

What the hell went wrong and where?

Eventually.

That.......

Well, just like that.......

I got all cuddly.

Late at night.

Allied Garrison.

Cernstadt military headquarters barracks.

Louise von Schwarz was sifting through a pile of papers by the light of a single lamp.

In combat, Louise von Schwarz was busy fighting and commanding, and in non-combat situations, she was busy looking at the overall picture of the army.

The higher up you go in the organization, the harder it is to get a proper break from both mental and physical work.

Ellen Artorius and Saviolin Tanada are busy with their physical work.

If anyone is busy thinking, it's the Imperial Emperor Bertus de Gradias.

But Louise von Schwarz is also a personal mastermind who has reached the level of commander in chief.

As such, she was, in some ways, the busiest person in the entire Alliance.

Heinrich von Schwarz kept an eye on Louise's busy schedule, even after the occupation of Serandia ended.

Heinrich had already seen what the war had done to the Royal Class garrison.

It was a disaster, but in the end, the survivors survived and something had to be done.

Now.

Heinrich von Schwarz was at Louise's side, staring at her until his eyeballs bled.

Even though it's way past my bedtime.

The sound of shuffling papers echoed quietly in the command center barracks.

In fact, Heinrich looking at the paperwork doesn't make things any faster.

But the documents themselves paint a picture of the situation in Cernstadt County as a whole.

Troop status, supply status, supply plans, minimum winterization needs, etc.

The documentation is valuable in and of itself.

Louise looks up from her papers to the side of the water.

The eye is straining, but there is no focus.

Louise knows now.

I realize my son is bad at using his brain.

Seeing numbers doesn't mean memorizing them.

It's about deciding what's needed, what's not enough, what's enough, and how to use limited supplies and troops. It's also about figuring out whether or not the reports of each departing commander are true.

It does this by reading the line spacing between numbers.

But Heinrich's behavior is too intuitive, as if he's just trying to memorize numbers.

It's just too cluttered.

Also, because it's cute.

Louise looked like she was about to burst out laughing.

Of course, she's not disappointed.

If there's one thing that's great, that's it.

There are a lot of people who don't even have that.

Heinrich doesn't do this because he knows he's the true heir to the Schwarz family.

It's not that they're doing it because they're ambitious and they need to know this.

Just trying to be helpful.

Louise knows she's only doing this out of the kindness of her heart.

So it's kind of sweet to see them trying to force themselves to do something they don't know how to do.

"Why don't you go in and get some rest, you must be tired."

"......is still good."

There's still no personal conversation between the two.

But slowly, something is changing.

If this is what it takes for this war to end.

I wonder if it could be a normal parent-child relationship later on.

Louise thought it was funny.

They're not exactly what you'd call ordinary, but that's what they both want in the end.

And Louise hasn't yet told her son the full story.

"...... is the youngest."

"What?"

"My friends' work is....... That's too bad."

Louise was also informed of the situation at the Royal Class Garrison.

It's none of her business, but she knows Heinrich cares, and she's heard the news.

Death and injury are not uncommon on the battlefield, but I can't imagine how anyone could be comfortable with what their friends went through.

At Louise's words, Heinrich seemed a little dazed, and then he smiled bitterly.

"What can I say......."

It was a mixture of self-help and despondency.

Even if you do everything you can, some things are inevitable.

It was sad, but I could see he was trying not to think too deeply.

It hurts to think about it, so we turn away from it, like running away.

"Thank you, sister."

Heinrich smiles wryly and looks at his papers.

In conclusion.

Louise is thrilled to see this side of her son.

The cold hard truth is that it doesn't help.

Just as he had not been able to rest for a long time, his son had not been able to rest for a long time.

This winter will probably be the last break.

"Not everyone is allowed to do this, but you know there are those who are allowed to return to the ecliptic or their homeworlds for the winter."

"It's ......."

As long as your hometown is safe, you should have that premise.

During this long break, the Allies were selectively giving long furloughs to those who wanted to go back and rest.

"Go back to your templates for now."

"Is that ......?"

Heinrich looks at Louise with a dumbfounded expression on his face, as if he's been told something out of the blue.

"It means take a break and come back. The big fight is over, you haven't had a long rest, and you deserve it."

The unexpected vacation order left Heinrich a little frozen.

"I'm fine, sister. Just in case something happens......."

His desire to stay in case of an emergency is admirable.

Louise doesn't just want her son to have a break.

"The king will be making an inspection soon."

"!"

The man you knew as your father, but was actually your grandfather.

Constantin von Schwarz will soon make his inspection as the battlefield situation stabilizes.

After all, Louise von Schwarz is the commander of the Cernstadt army, not the king.

"I have some explaining to do to the king, and it will be a very uncomfortable and dangerous place for you, Heinrich. It will be an uncomfortable and dangerous position for you, Heinrich."

A sister who faked the disappearance and murder of two brothers is approaching the moment when she must explain what happened to her father.

There's no telling if they'll ever be found.

But there's nothing good about having Heinrich in that position. Whether the truth comes out or not.

"So, that means stay away."

It's a quick getaway in the guise of a vacation.

For a vacation, for an escape.

In the end, it was Louise's consideration that led her to return to the temple.

"Sister....... Is that okay?"

"...... should be fine."

It must be terrible for her, to kill her siblings, to remain silent, to tell the truth, but she only says it briefly.

But Heinrich understood that forcing himself to stay by her side would not help her in the upcoming inspection.

"Again, it's not about inspections. It's about rest."

Heinrich is no stranger to long hours.

Even Heinrich wasn't among the superhumans who could enchant.

But he was more active than most, so it was clear that his fatigue was building up.

Louise thinks vaguely.

Temples.

If only I could see it with my own eyes.

I couldn't wait to see where my son had spent his life.

But the wind is the wind, and she had an awful lot of work to do.

This winter.

Heinrich will rest when the fight is far away.

However, Louise von Schwarz's place is here.

You never know.

Maybe after this war is over, I'll be able to set foot in the temple myself.
