            Episode 309.





The result was 3-0 in favor of Herriot.

Her opponent, Isa Shelkin, was dumbfounded.

You've been defeated by a magic major.

It was inevitable.

The downside to magic is casting. But in the face of Herriot's unusually fast casting speed, Aisa Shelkin was always going to be a beat slower.

While Heriot obviously doesn't have the ability to no-cast, he literally tossed a melee major under the bus in a situation where his casting speed was apparently very high.

Redina's talent for no-casting is what makes it so ridiculous.

A guy like Heriot with enough hp can overwhelm a combat major with his casting speed alone, and if he didn't cast at all, he'd beat them to a pulp before they even had a chance to breathe.

The audience is just cheering, but we can't help but be baffled.

It's kind of weird for Heriot to be that way, because it's already weird.

That goes for Saviolin Tana, who has been watching all the fights and commenting on them.

"Magic requires casting."

"Yes, because it's common sense."

At Charlotte's answer, Saviolin Tana tilted her head; she, too, seemed to find the situation a bit bizarre.

"But at higher levels, Battlemages use magic almost instantaneously, without the computation of casting."

"Yeah, that's probably true too."

"Herriot de Saint-Ouen seems to have the casting speed of a skilled Battlemage."

The look on Saviolin Tana's face was one of conviction: "There's no way that's possible.

For Saviolin Tana, an experienced Battlemage was not a lightweight, but a battle-worn, battle-scarred Battlemage.

Casting speed of a Battlemage with at least 10 years of experience.

Is it really possible.

"Of all the mages, Battlemages are the only ones who care about multicasting or chain casting. The rest of the classes don't need to cast as fast, and finesse is the way to go, not speed....... Why else would you spend time on that skill......."

Fast casting speed is great, but it's only for Battle Mages. Battle mages are looked down upon by wizards, as I once heard a kid say.

Fast casting is, after all, a skill reserved for knife-eating mages.

It seemed incomprehensible to Saviolin Tana that a young lady of the Grand Duchess of St. Thuan should be skilled in a skill that only a Battlemage could master.

Herriot wanted to have real power. That's why he devotes his time to skills that don't necessarily have much to do with his noble birth.

Of course, the fact that I was able to do that just because I took the time to do it didn't make sense to me or to Savior Tana.

What the hell was going on at the Magic Institute?

Adelia met my gaze and smiled in embarrassment.

It's a secret.

"I think Herriot de Saint-Ouen is going to do pretty well."

In the end, it was clear to me that Herriot had gained a significant amount of combat power that I hadn't anticipated.

Ellen said that Harriet would do well.

I don't know if she knew this was coming, but Ellen didn't seem too surprised.



* * *



As the round of 32 matches unfolded, I realized that, contrary to my fears, Heriot had the right stuff. Heriot was clearly good enough to win the Unlimited tournament qualifier and earn a spot in the main event.

With the round of 32 matches in Group C underway, the moment everyone in the know has been waiting for has arrived.

Olivia Ranze, Royal Class 5th grader.

Because of her celebrity status, some people recognized Olivia and cheered, and the royal class reacted with enthusiasm.

The emcee rambled on about Olivia. There was a lot of unfamiliarity, but Olivia just stood there with a thin smile on her face.

But if it's a problem.

She gave up her faith.

But she can still use holy power. And at a very powerful level.

However, it would be problematic if she were to use her divine powers, having renounced her faith at this point.

She must fight without divine powers if she does not wish to be heard.

The opponent is a fifth-grade boy.

She's introduced as being from the General Class, but apparently she's from the Orbis Class. The Royal and Orbis classes have had quite a bit of interaction, so it's not too strange that Olivia would know each other.

Olivia didn't look in my direction.

Everyone is curious to see what Olivia can do, and it's the first time Saviolin Tana has seen her in action.

-And with that, let's start the last match of Group C!

With a startup declaration.

I was curious to see what Olivia Ranze would look like in a fight without using her divine powers.

The opponent is armed with a spear.

Olivia was unarmed.

The spear-wielding opponent's body is engulfed in blue mana.

Olivia looks at her opponent with a smile.

-Sorry about the audience.

Olivia's words rang in my ears.

-Because my game is kinda, kinda boring.

-Woof

Olivia's body was enveloped in blue, fiery mana.

I had assumed that Olivia would be able to enhance her magic. Without using any of her divine power, the naked Olivia moves.

No, I could tell she was moving, but I couldn't even follow her movements with my eyes.

-Bam!

-cur...... billion!

The next moment, Olivia was already ramming her fist into her opponent's abdomen.

The force of the blow sent his opponent flying, and he landed a good distance off the field.

Even with my enchantments, I couldn't believe the destructive power of my bare fists.

-Oh, was that too much?

Set 1 was over in a flash.

Strong contender.

No, I think I'm the only one who can win.

Me and Ellen were staring blankly at Olivia, who had just blown away an opponent who was just as enchanted as she was.

You must fight without divine power.

Well, I wonder if it was a penalty in the first place.

Olivia seemed unstoppable in her condition.

I can't believe the nickname for her is Saint Eredian.

Shouldn't he have been labeled the strongest in the temple?



* * *



After all the round of 32 matches have been completed.

After a short break, it was time for the round of 16 matches to begin.

Just like in the first grade tournament, the winners of each group will face off in the semifinals and finals tomorrow.

So Herriot will need to win this round of 16 and the next quarterfinal to have a shot at the final.

But finals aren't what Herriot is about.

Player Waiting Room.

Harriet sat still on the couch. She wanted to go into her room and collect her thoughts, but she thought it would be good to get a feel for the people she might have to deal with.

"You said Herriot, you're amazing. I'll see you at the next game, take care."

"Oh....... Yeah."

Some people were nervous, but the next match was with a cheerful-looking female senior. From the Royal Class, I knew she was a psychic, not a melee player.

The ability is Wind.

He easily defeated his opponent by blowing him away with wind pressure and knocking him out of the game.

She wasn't sure what to do about it.

"Would you like to try this? It's delicious."

"Oh, no....... It's fine."

She would sit next to him and mumble about this and that.

"Well, if my wind is blocked by your protection, there's not much I can do about it, and I don't really know how to fight."

I think he's pretty sure he's going to lose. He's counting on the wind to create a long hand, but his opponent is Herriot, who knows how to use protection.

The girl who whined that she was going to lose because she had a bad match, even though she was a senior, was subtly cute.

While he might be pretending to be vulnerable and then suddenly revealing his hidden skills, he doubted that his fellow royals would go to such lengths.

From the looks of it, he didn't seem too keen on winning. Harriet was a little annoyed by the constant chatter, but she didn't hate it in the end.

"Not really....... You don't seem to be nervous."

"Nervous? Well, there's no reason to be, is there?"

She nibbled on a macaron, sipped her black tea, and smiled bashfully.

"Olivia's going to win Group C anyway."

With Olivia in the race, it seemed like she'd given up because there was no way she was going to win. Her reaction made me realize that she might have.

I didn't even see what was going on.

Most of the participants are capable of enchantment, but this one stands out.

She hadn't even used her main divine power. Everyone seemed to have given up after seeing Olivia's overwhelming power.

How I would have handled it.

Herriot thought about it, but couldn't come up with a good answer.

Olivia Ranze.

An unlimited tournament to try and beat her. She'd just seen Olivia Ranze's skills, and she didn't think she could beat her.

But first, she wanted to stand in front of him.

She has to make it all the way to the quarterfinals, the last match of Group C, to face Olivia. I won't be able to beat her, but I'm going to give her a run for her money.

I'm not sure why.

Olivia Ranchada, who is sure to be tougher than Ellen.

Favoritism was an emotion Herriot didn't have.

However, it's been around for a while.

The desire to be strong naturally becomes the desire not to lose.

As Harriet chatted with the contestants, she saw Olivia Ranze approaching in the distance. She's been at Temple for a long time, and she's smiling and chatting with the other contestants, who are now her competition.

Ellen said she didn't like him.

Herriot hates him, too.

Olivia walked over and made eye contact with Harriet.

"Hello?"

"......Hello."

"Um, you're a friend of Reinhard's, too, right? Nice to meet you."

Olivia smirked.

The word "you".

That word that puts someone before me.

Herriot resents that.

She's seen Olivia Lanchester's unnecessary confrontations with Ellen before, and she knows where that desire to challenge comes from.

Olivia doesn't like Ellen.

Ellen doesn't like Olivia either.

"You're amazing. I can't believe you're already that good as a freshman. Aren't you playing against your sister in the finals of Group C today?"

But Olivia doesn't hate Herriot.

The kind look and tone of voice, the lack of animosity.

Unabashed praise.

"How are you feeling, do you need me to cast a healing spell on you?"

Unnecessary consideration.

Herriot knows that his opponent is not wary of him at all.

That attitude that you don't need to show hostility to someone as small as you.

It's not even ignoring, which makes me feel even more ignored.

"Good luck, both of you."

I don't like you.

You don't hate me.

Herriot hates this situation because of the gap in their feelings for each other.

"I, I don't like her."

"......?"

And so it was that Herriot suddenly threw cold water on the cheerfulness. Olivia stared at her, then scratched her cheek.

"Oh....... Really?"

Olivia gave a subtle smile, as if reading something in Harriet's expression.

It's the look he sometimes gives Ellen when he sees her. It's a smile with a subtle sneer.

"So what?"

Harriet stares at Olivia, still.

Ellen was annoyed and upset that she was being hated for nothing.

You don't even know what it's like to be hated like that.

You can't imagine how frustrating it is to have someone you dislike do you a favor because you've been deemed unworthy of them.

So.

I'm going to make you hate me.

I'll make it impossible to ignore me.

"Just, no."

"Really? That's too bad."

At Harriet's words, Olivia beamed.

"I don't really care about you."

"......."

"For you". A phrase that implies he doesn't know anyone else but you, and that he's not really interested in you.

Again, he was intentionally ignoring himself.

You may not be able to win.

I won't let you ignore it any longer.

Harriet gritted her teeth as she watched Olivia's back.



* * *



Herriot has grown by leaps and bounds.

It was the final Group C match of the tournament, and they squeaked through to the quarterfinals.

My opponent in the Round of 16 was a Royal Class 4, Wind-type psychic, and I lost. I blocked the wind and aimed five firebolts back at him, causing him to bow out. As if there was no point in trying.

She was the woman who told me to come to her if anything happened during the Mayotte incident. I never did, but I remembered her face.

In the end, it was a mismatch: a melee combat specialist who wanted to fight by blowing people away with the wind, and a magic specialist who was no match for him.

And just like that, the Group C final.

Unsurprisingly, Olivia made light work of her Round of 16 opponent and advanced to the Group C final.

Herriot de Saint-Ouen.

Olivia Ranze.

The winner of the two will advance to the quarterfinals, where they'll have a shot at the title tomorrow.

Despite two solid games, I and the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan eventually broke down again.

-MoonMoonMoon

"......just shake it off."

Ellen's face mask.

-Haah.......

-Honey, what's wrong?

-The opponent is not too bad.......

Likewise, the Grand Duke being confronted by Madame Saint-Antoine.

No matter how much Herriot has grown, Olivia Ranze is no match for her right now.

The only hope is that Olivia Ranze won't use her divine powers.

That slim advantage is the only way that Herriot can claim victory.

Everyone in the royal class, regardless of grade, was holding their breath.

Herriot doing well in an unlimited tournament despite being a magic major in his freshman year.

Olivia Ranze deserves the title of Temple Strongest.

They were facing each other on the field.
