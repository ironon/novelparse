Ludwig's nervousness doesn't really mean anything.

Ludwig's nervousness was that the Devil or some other force would approach Scarlett, and the Devil was with her when Ludwig arrived.

When Scarlett asks for time, Ludwig says he can only wait a few hours.

When Scarlett said she wanted to be alone, Ludwig said he wanted her to go for a walk and collect her thoughts until he returned, then headed off somewhere.

Scarlett did not know that Ludwig had gone to the Temple School of Magic.

Ludwig has been acting strangely for some time now.

A demon who knows the truth, but ultimately doesn't know where he's been or what he's been doing.

In the end, Scarlett is afraid of both.

I trusted them both, but they were both now afraid.

A dorm room you could have come back to.

"What....... happened?"

The cat turned back to the demon, and Scarlett demanded an explanation from the demon.

I can't help but be scared, but Scarlett needed to know what was going on.

The demon cautiously looks out the window.

Ludwig might be nearby, keeping an eye on Scarlett's movements.

Seeing that there are no listening ears around, the demon opens his mouth.

"At the last battle of Wallen, you saw a strange army, didn't you?"

"Yes, apparently......."

All saw the majesty of that strange army.

Everyone had more or less figured out that the Empire was the real power that they had been hiding all this time in some way.

"It's a bit gory to explain, but the army is actually kind of like a golem."

"Golem......?"

"Yeah."

Reinhardt nods steadily.

"A golem made of corpses."

Scarlett couldn't help but gulp at the words.



* * *



Just as Ludwig didn't have much time for Scarlett, the demon didn't have much time to explain to her.

What powers the Empire touched, and who those resurrected were.

And who was responsible for the experiment.

Hearing all of this in such a short amount of time left Scarlett frozen.

I've heard too many horror stories to name just one.

And it was Christina, Louis, and Anna, who had been in charge of the experiment so far, who had been talking about it so casually.

"Ludwig recently had one of those arms transplanted."

"Ludwig has....... chimera procedure?"

"Yeah, if not that, then what."

When the demon asked if there was any magic outside of the Chimera procedure that could do that, Scarlet was speechless.

War makes too many things possible.

Scarlet couldn't help but feel a sinking feeling in her stomach at the thought that Ludwig had wanted to return to the battlefield so badly that he needed such magic.

But at the same time, I couldn't help but wonder.

It's an army made of cruel and unusual things, but it's a necessary one.

It's an army built to end wars, so it should be a force that's needed right now.

"But....... Why is it important to me that I can neutralize that army......."

Before she could finish, Scarlett couldn't help but realize something.

After the gate event.

The devil is in the details of what happens next.

Someone might try to take advantage of him, Ludwig said.

"After the Gate debacle....... Do you want me to get rid of that army......?"

It's the most powerful force in history, let alone humanity.

Scarlett can neutralize that army with her powers in an instant.

Like a golem suddenly reduced to scrap metal, the greatest army in history could be neutralized with the same ease if you did the same thing to it.

"Yeah."

The demon nods.

"Ludwig is right."

I'm not going to deny it, says the devil.

"Ludwig is really back to protect you, and I intend to use you."

There's no point in making excuses and self-rationalizing.

When Ludwig says he's protecting Scarlett, no matter how suspicious she looks, he's telling the truth.

No matter how well you package it, you're still going to have to use Scarlet.

Ludwig rushes back to the temple to keep Scarlett out of the Devil's clutches, but the Devil arrives just in time to use her.

Scarlett couldn't help but shudder at the Demon King's casual acknowledgment of everything.

"Do you really....... fight?"

"......."

"You don't have to, you're not....... You didn't want this, you're not the kind of person who wants this."

"......."

"So many people were killed and injured in the Gate incident alone, and as soon as that's over. I mean, do we have to start thinking about the next fight now, before it's even over?"

To Scarlett's despair, the Toroe demon remained still, his back against the wall.

"Yeah, maybe we don't have to fight, who knows."

"Then when it's all said and done, we'll just have to live in each other's places. That army will eventually be....... What's the point if there's no fighting?"

"Sure, sure."

Even the most powerful army is meaningless off the battlefield.

In such a large land, in a land where so many people have died that most of the land is empty, is it not enough for each person to live in their own place?

As if that weren't enough, as soon as one fight was over, he was already preparing for the next. Scarlett didn't know.

"Things are so much different than they used to be."

"What do you mean, different......?"

"You don't know much about the situation in the ecliptic, much less the situation in the Alliance."

Scarlett has been away from the ecliptic for a long time, so she doesn't know how it works.

She doesn't even know the mood of the Alliance. Scarlet isn't in a position to decide that.

"We've come too far to stop, and we've done too much to just say, 'Let's go back to nothing and live in each other's space.'"

It's not like a toy where you can put everything back when you've played with it long enough.

The world is too big to play with.

So what moves, stays moved.

You can't invalidate everything.

"I don't know, maybe I'll end up with a bigger problem this time because of what I did. Maybe."

Just as everything we did to stop the gate ended up completing it. This may have a similar ending.

But at least Scarlett knows that what's happening to the world isn't a demonic conspiracy.

It's not the devil's conspiracy, it's the devil's failure.

Even after that one disastrous failure, the devil built something once again.

"Maybe it's selfish. Maybe my behavior of trying to do something again on a topic that has failed once will seem disgusting and unforgivable to some people, and there are those people out there."

"......."

"But I've come too far to stop, and I don't know how this thing I'm doing is really going to end, but to stop now, to pretend it never happened, would be the biggest mistake and wrong I could make."

If you didn't want to do it, you had to do nothing.

If you haven't even started, I don't know, but if you start something, you have to see it through to the end.

The moment you give up, everything you've built comes crashing down.

Even the devil doesn't know the complete answer.

However, the devil knows the perfect wrong answer.

Half the ecliptic, half the Alliance.

Running away from everything by pretending it never happened.

That's a perfect wrong answer.

"I'm not going to deny that it's a very risky choice for you to help me, and I'm not going to say that it's the right choice for you to help me, because I might actually be wrong."

"......."

"I don't know the answer, and I know that the people who want to kill me have their own legitimate reasons, and I know that I have no excuse for their anger toward me, because, after all, it all happened because of me."

Even those who want to kill the devil have their reasons, and no one can deny them.

But the devil has his own agenda.

You've come too far to turn back.

Now it's about getting where you need to go, getting there more safely, and getting there with certainty.

It's just the reality that all other options have become unavailable.

"Scarlet."

"......."

"Help."

The demon looks at the red-haired girl.

"I need you."

Scarlett had never heard anything so short, yet so sincere, in her life.

Scarlett stares at the demon, stunned.

No.

Look at Reinhardt.

A memory from long ago flashes through my mind.

A memory that seemed to have been lost amidst war and countless deaths.

But sure enough, somewhere in the back of my mind, a memory was being reawakened.

Demon.

Reinhardt was a strange man.

Despite being the last word in Class A, and being criticized for being inferior to Class B, he still got into accidents.

Rumor has it that he's a bit of a weirdo, both within Class A and in Class B as well.

The guy you don't want to get involved with.

Reinhardt was certainly the kind of guy who would hear that.

But for Scarlett, Reinhardt was a weirdo in a different sense.

One day.

"What's wrong with red.

I found myself being bullied by Erich de Lapaeri, and I said something like that out of the blue.

He's a strong man.

It was after winning a duel with a senior.

After winning what was clearly a reckless fight through some kind of miracle, Reinhardt said.

Facts.

Scarlett was more afraid of Reinhardt than Erich at that point.

There wasn't much tied up.

But Scarlett always watched Reinhardt from afar.

If only I could be like that.

I wish I had that kind of courage.

For Scarlett, who had been hunkered down in fear of being kicked out of the Temple, Reinhardt was a shock in more ways than one.

Suddenly.

I woke up and realized that Reinhardt had been watching me the whole time.

I want to be like that.

That's how Reinhardt became an idol in my mind.

Just like that.

Looking back at the past naturally brought up other memories.

Scarlett couldn't help but smile at the memory of that time.

I couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of my own thoughts in this situation.

"At the tournament, remember?"

"Uh....... Suddenly?"

The demon nodded at Scarlett's question, a puzzled expression on his face.

"......I remember."

Reinhardt couldn't help but remember the moment when Scarlett, out of nowhere, told him you were my idol.

These are times and events from the past that have been buried under so much death and sorrow.

However, it turned out to be nothing, which made it all the more precious.

The days when everything was peaceful, when nothing was wrong, will never come back.

"I said, 'There are people who hate you, and there are people who love you.'"

"You said....... That's what you said, you."

Reinhardt's eccentric personality and temper got him many detractors.

But even then, there were people who didn't hate Reinhardt for some strange reason.

If not necessarily Ellen and Harriet, there were quite a few people who were close to Reinhardt.

There were a lot of people who hated it, but there were definitely people who loved it.

Do you like this guy, do you hang out with that guy.

I've had a lot of people tell me that.

As she watched, Scarlett realized.

"I looked at you and realized that just like I can't make everyone like me, I can't make everyone hate me."

"Yeah....... You said that."

Scarlett realized something in that thought.

If it's impossible to be loved by everyone, it must be impossible to be hated by everyone.

"Strangely, so much has changed....... So, so much has changed......."

Scarlett looks at Reinhardt.

The one now called the Devil.

"You're still in that situation."

Like that time when everyone hated Reinhardt and everyone loved Reinhardt.

The same goes for demons.

Some people hate the devil to the point of wanting to kill him, while others can't bring themselves to hate him.

Or, someone will still love the devil.

The scale has only grown from temple to global.

"......Is that how it works?"

He smiles bitterly, as if he knows what he's talking about.

In that past Temple, Scarlett had a crush on Reinhardt.

What made him different from others was that he didn't like it out of reason, but out of respect.

Reinhardt, once an idol, is now a cursed fiend for even daring to mention his name.

No, it was a demon from the start.

Such a being has found himself across time.

And I ask you sincerely.

Help.

I need you.

What to do.

The Devil had his reasons. He said he didn't mean for this to happen, and who are we to say that he deserves to stand on the blade of judgment?

But what about the opposite?

How can the cries of those who say the devil must die be unjust, then?

There are causes that are justified, and there are causes that deserve to die.

The Devil is a contradiction in terms.

The devil is in the details for a reason.

Those who wish for the death and destruction of demons have their reasons.

What to choose if everyone is justified and everyone has their own reasons.

"I am......."

Scarlett, at a crossroads, went still.
