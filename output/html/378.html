Lucinyl is a low-intervention style.

If I'm doing things that have nothing to do with rebuilding the realm, so be it. It's not that I don't care about what I'm doing, it's just that I'd rather help where I can.

"Look, in a situation like this, I don't know if it's normal, I don't know if I'd call it normal, but isn't it child's play, Archdemon? Even a homunculus vampire knows that?"

But this time, it didn't make too much sense to me.

Your father's spirit has entered someone's soul, and you want to get rid of it.

Lucinil stares at me. Like she's trying to read something unreadable.

Do I have to tell an unbelievable story like I did with Elise?

"I don't think you're doing this because you're afraid you won't be able to eat him if he comes back to life....... Well, sure. I'm sure you have your own ideas."

Lucinil crossed her arms as if she didn't want to know.

"Anyway, I don't know whose soul you planted a piece of your soul in, but my opinion is the same: if you split it back up, you're going to end up with two people who are mixed up, and you can't go back to the way you were. Of course, I can't guarantee that the split person will be sane or not."

There's no going back.

Does that mean there is no answer other than coexistence?

"Then who will be the master of the body, the master of the soul....... can't be determined?"

"Hmmm....... I don't know what you're talking about, but are you wondering if the person whose soul is mixed with the body is in control, or if the demon is in control?"

"Yes."

Charlotte's body is sometimes overwhelmed by the demon's power, and she can't help but lose her sanity.

"It's bound to crash. It's like a side effect, but it gets better over time. That's what happens when different souls and spirits merge."

Over time, it will be fine.

Am I sure it's going to be okay?

"I don't know if that's the right way to put it, but it's going to go away and it's going to be okay, and it's not really a question of who's in control or not in the first place, it's just going to be one, it's going to be like two and one at the same time........ kind of thing."

Charlotte and the demon's soul have already become one.

Time will tell.

To be complete is to be mixed with the devil.

"Perhaps in time, the demon's self and someone else's self will be fully combined, and as you say, it's impossible to get rid of the demon's soul and self."

Unstoppable.

Unless Charlotte dies, the demon is revived.

Charlotte's symptoms are caused by her becoming one with the demon's spirit.

But it's impossible to separate them because they're already mixed together.

"But you, you seem to know this person a little bit, and apparently you've witnessed some of these battles for control."

"Yeah....... Well."

"Hmm, so you've never talked to the devil himself?"

None.

I fought it, but obviously, it had gone completely insane that day.

"I tried to talk to him, but it didn't work - he didn't even recognize me."

Apparently, I had shown Valerie's form to the demon that had taken over Charlotte's body, but it didn't recognize me at all. So I had no choice but to fight.

At my words, Lucinil shakes her head.

"Hmmm, so the side that got separated lost its mind. They couldn't communicate at all?"

"Yes."

"Then the soul of the separated demon has gone mad."

Is that what happened?

Then what?

"What happens then?"

"Hmmm......."

We can't return Charlotte to her original state.

"I'm sure it'll get better in time, the soul adapts to live after all, and the madness will subside."

It will get better over time.

The answer was surprisingly simple.

But Charlotte realizes that she can't just be Charlotte anymore.

You're Charlotte, but you're also Balie, the Ancestral Demon.

Rusinil shakes his head.

"Well, if the attacks become frequent enough, you'll be nearing full fusion, and you'll have demonic consciousness. Are there any signs of that? Like, demonic speech, or recognizing you.......? or something?"

To be one with the devil means to be one with the devil's ego.

As the fusion stabilizes as the demon's madness from the effects of the soul split subsides, Charlotte absorbs the demon's consciousness.

In other words, it has a memory.

"Not at all....... at all."

But the Charlotte I've seen hasn't shown any signs of that.

If the demon's memory had returned and the two selves had merged, he wouldn't have tried to resolve the situation in the first place.

The tears, anger, and sadness I saw in Charlotte's eyes were all real because everything she did was an act.

You can't assume that Charlotte is hiding everything with the memories and consciousness of the Ancestor Demon. Lucinil crossed her arms and frowned.

"Well, it's not uncommon for a split soul to go insane and lose all sense of self....... Hmm. But a demon's soul can't be that weak."

You've fused your souls, but one of you is so weak that your consciousness is completely lost.

But when I saw Lucinil's reaction that the Devil couldn't have done that, I remembered something.

Words.

Obviously, I used an unicorn.

Words are not magic.

It's clear that my words have somehow affected Charlotte's condition and the demonic spirit that has taken up residence in her.

"I recently had a seizure per se, but....... I didn't go crazy."

Charlotte had one recent power attack.

"Uhm....... Really? Did you talk to the demon?"

"No, the original owner of the body was maintaining the ego."

Charlotte came to me shaking with fear after a power attack. But she wasn't clearly insane, and she didn't feel like she was taking on someone else's identity.

"Hmmm....... What is that?"

Rusinil didn't seem to understand what I was saying at all.

"Did you really lose your ego so badly that you couldn't care less about soul fusion?"

Lucinil doesn't believe that the Ancestral Demon King's magical skills and understanding of the art of betrothal could have been of such a high caliber, and in fact, Lucinil can only assume that the Demon King's misuse of the art of betrothal led to this outcome.

No.

The Demon King has used the Art of Engagement properly.

There would be seizures, but there would be a process of gradually fusing with Charlotte's soul, becoming one.

The day you first awakened your spirit.

The first words I used.

Disappear from Charlotte's body.

I definitely said that.

Charlotte did have one seizure afterward, but it didn't overtake her sanity.

The demon's soul and Charlotte's soul are inseparable.

Because.

Did my superpower make the demon's ego disappear, not his soul?

"That's weird......."

If so, I no longer have to try to save Charlotte.

I had already saved Charlotte in that moment.

The demon's insane self is gone, and only the demon's power remains.

Charlotte's task is not to separate her soul, but to adapt to the demonic power she is left with.

That was all we needed to do.

"Anyway, you seem to care more about the spirits than the demons."

Lucinil shook her head in disbelief.

"He's such a weirdo."

Of course.

In true Lucinil fashion, I didn't ask more questions.

If anything, it made me wonder on my end.

"But how do you know that so well?"

"Conjuring?"

"Yes."

Rusinil shrugs.

"Have you done an experiment or two?"

a.

That's the impression I got.

Road vampires were lunatics, weren't they?



* * *



When Lucinil told me that she couldn't separate their mixed souls, it felt like the sky was falling.

But as we talked, Charlotte didn't need to do anything more.

Charlotte came to me, overcome with power but not with reason.

That in itself was proof. The power itself colors Charlotte, but her mind is intact, for the demon's ego no longer exists.

That in itself was proof that Charlotte was fine.

The marriage ceremony wasn't a clue, but it's okay if it wasn't. Charlotte will be fine from now on.

But even if you know that Charlotte is okay, you don't know if others will be.

In the end, the question is whether Charlotte can accept that her power is no longer a threat, and the question is how the empire will accept it when she's fully embraced it.

Having ominous powers, even in Chuck's eyes, is already a weakness for Charlotte.

That's something Bertus can attack at any time.

Lucinil is a master of seduction.

He seemed to have done a lot of experimenting with spirits to see what was possible. It sent chills down my spine to think of Lucinil with that innocent look on his face, manipulating his subjects with soul-touching magic.

Wouldn't it be better to be an openly shady Antirrhinus?

While Lucinil and I were chatting about this and that, Elise came out of the library with some books.

"There are so many wizards I've never seen before, it's taking me a while to choose."

Many of the spells were unrecognizable from their names, and Eleris put the book down as if it had taken her a long time to flip through them all, figure out what they were, and decide if she should take them or not. Even so, I think that's pretty fast.

In her concentration, Elise didn't seem to hear about Charlotte.

"That's a vision that's been building over the course of Darklands' history."

The visions of demons, or rather, demonic wizards, built up over a long, long time. Lucinil looks toward the library and murmurs.

"But from your point of view, I think it's better to take it all back or burn it. You didn't say you were here with a princess......."

Instead of speaking, Lucinil looks at me.

I told Lucinil that I was here with the Empress, and that we had discovered a bunker in the basement of the Demon Castle.

Why? Here with the Empress?

And what we were just talking about.

Demonic Arcane Grimoires.

Blah blah blah blah.

He looked like he got it.

"Oh, it's the devil's spirit, or something, that's why you're a princess."

"It's ......."

"You're a demonic reconstructionist and a nabal, and you're not interested at all?"

You know from everything I've said so far that I'm trying to save the princess, and I realize that saving the princess defeats all of my ostensible purposes.

"I can see why Elise is helping you."

Lucinil sighed, as if the question had been answered. Eleris felt a little embarrassed that Lucinil thought she was bound to find out at some point.

I didn't want to get carried away.

You can't believe it's come to this.

"So, what are you going to do, what the hell do you want?"

"World peace."

Lucinil narrows his brow.

"Are you asking me to believe ......?"

"That's true."

Lucinil looked at Eleris as if she didn't even want to talk to me, with all my babbling.

"That's right, Lucinil."

Eleris said with a breezy laugh.

"Even Elise, so that's really scary."

Lucinil looks back and forth between Elise and me as if to say, "Don't play.

"......No, what does this have to do with world peace, I don't understand it anymore?"

Lucinil muttered in disbelief, as it didn't look like me and Elise were messing around at all.

"I guess that's just the way it is, then."

Lucinil said to me one day.

"Um, yeah."

Lucinil nodded, as if to say, "I don't understand what you don't understand.
