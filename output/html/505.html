            Episode 505.





No one in Edina needs to be sacrificed to save the demon.

That's Edina's power loss.

An extraordinary being with two holy relics.

Ellen is destined to fight the Devil at some point. So, no matter what happens, she can't be with the Devil.

You're just making real enemies out of people who are destined to be enemies anyway.

Whether Ellen is possessed by the spirits or not, she is destined to fight the demon anyway.

So nothing really changes.

From that perspective, Antony's statement that no one in the room needed to sacrifice was reasonable.

Not everyone in this room knows much about Ellen Artorius. What they do know is that Ellen has semi-forced her way from being the antagonist of the Devil to the hope of humanity.

Charlotte stared down at the table, her face set in stone.

Two years after Gate.

Charlotte and Ellen shared the same guilt.

Both Charlotte and Ellen blamed themselves for not trusting Reinhardt when it mattered.

They were both torturing themselves with endless self-pity.

Charlotte was able to be with Reinhardt, but Ellen was not and is not destined to be.

Charlotte knows that there is no way for Ellen to escape the long, drawn-out process of self-pity and guilt.

But now, Reinhardt may not even exist.

Ellen would give her life to save such a Reinhardt.

If Reinhardt could be saved by taking on the hatred and hopes of every soul in the world, by being consumed by them, he would do so.

Even if your very existence is eventually assimilated by the spirits.

Charlotte knows that if Ellen Artorius could save Reinhardt, she would.

They will make that choice without even thinking about it.

If there comes a day when she has to fight for her life with Reinhardt, and it's the only way to save him now, Ellen has no choice but to do it.

Charlotte, having experienced the same guilt and self-blame, knew what Ellen would do without having to listen.

Herriot shook his head, his face turning blue.

"Reinhardt would never, ever accept it."

Whether Ellen accepted it or not, Herriot knew Reinhardt would never tolerate such a situation.

And we all agree with Herriot.

The spirits that inhabit Olivia hate her. She has accepted them into her body because she thinks it's right that she should.

The Reinhardt of today is slowly dying because of the self-hatred, anger, despair, and revenge of so many souls.

So it was clear that even if Ellen tried to take on the burden, she would never accept it.

"Of course you do, so we'll have to do this in secret, so that the Great One never knows what the lesser ones are planning."

"Since you're in such a weakened state, a simple hypnosis or sleep spell might be able to keep you asleep for a long time."

"When the Great One awakens from his deep sleep, the work will have been done."

"If they fooled me once, why wouldn't they fool me twice?"

With a sinister grin, Antirrhinus looks to a seat in the room.

"Thunder King. Isn't that right?"

"......."

Riana clenched her fists and narrowed her eyes at the malicious gaze that said, "You who have deceived the king once before, in the name of serving him, understand what I mean.

"You piece of shit......."

Lucinil gritted his teeth and glared at Antirrhinus, who, disgusted by his spiteful behavior, bellowed, "You're a fool!

"What the hell is wrong with you? What the hell....... What the hell is wrong with you?"

"Lord of Demand. Am I wrong, or do you have any answers, other than the ones I've suggested?"

Eventually, Lucinyl exploded.

"There isn't! I know there isn't! You're right, you're right, you must be right! That's the only way....... That's the only way! But....... Why on earth do you only think that way, why. Why do you only think in ways that make someone suffer?"

"That's right......."

Antirrhinus laughs.

"Well, isn't that fun?"

The grotesquely cruel laugh sent chills down Charlotte's spine.

Lucinil rises from his seat and mumbles something coldly, as if tired of the malice.

"You are a monster who feeds on tears."

Lucinil slams the conference room door in disgust and looks back at Antirrhinus.

"I, I hate you."

"That's too bad."

-Bang!

Not wanting to deal with him, Rusinil left the room.

Antony is right.

It has to be the best choice.

Fool Reinhardt one more time.

In the name of Reinhardt.

To those who can afford it, I make an offer they can't refuse.

He was right.

Antirhynchus, as a loyalist to Reinhard, did find a way to save his master.

Even if the conclusion is one of loyalty, is this the way to go?

If the intent was just to find a sequence.

Is that really loyalty?

"I don't see any other way to do it."

But. even for a true believer, that's the only conclusion that matters in the end.

"I agree."

Sarkegaard agreed with that conclusion.

After the Senate meeting, Herriot paces the halls of Razak's castle in a daze.

The thought that this was a terrible plan never left my mind.

Herriot walked dazedly down the hall and stood in front of Reinhardt's bedroom.

When he opened the bedroom door, he found Reinhardt asleep.

Three people in bed.

Olivia Ranze holds Reinhardt's sleeping hand with a worried look on her face.

Similarly, Airy places her hand on Reinhardt's forehead.

And there was Riana, staring out the window, unable to look at Reinhardt properly.

Olivia continues to restore her failing body.

Airi somehow manages to hold on to her crumbling sanity.

The two of them somehow managed to hold on to Reinhard's dying body and mind.

"Look at....... What do you think?"

Olivia shook her head, looking depressed.

It's not getting any better, it's getting worse.

"The time I can stay conscious is getting shorter and shorter."

"......Yes."

When Reinhardt was unconscious, Airi had been forcing him to dream peaceful dreams so that he would not be exposed to the despair of the spirits.

This is only possible for a demon that rules dreams, and the most powerful of them all.

The good news is that Airi is skilled at using this power to heal, not mesmerize.

By touching the dreams of so many people in a healing way, I was able to touch Reinhardt's unconscious, which was in the middle of chaos.

Herriot stands still, looking down at Reinhardt, who, judging by his complexion, looks much worse for wear.

Herriot can't even begin to fathom the pain Reinhardt is in.

"How much....... bad is this?"

Harriet asks, looking at Olivia.

Only Olivia knows what Reinhardt is dealing with right now. Olivia looks at Reinhardt, who is sleeping in agony, even as Airi manipulates his dreams, and Nazik says, "I'm sorry.

"In my life, I've never experienced anything so horrible."

Olivia looks up at Harriet.

"Even if I could handle this, even if I could take over Reinhardt's pain and live with it, it would be too much to bear."

Her expression hardened at the mention of such terrible pain. She knows what Olivia thinks of Reinhardt.

Olivia has been saved by Reinhard several times. Olivia once saved Reinhardt's life.

Herriot knows that Olivia is the kind of person who would die for Reinhardt.

If she can carry it, Olivia can carry it.

However, it's not without its fears and terrors.

It was such a horrifying experience that it was inevitable that she would have some hesitation.

It is a tremendous spiritual pain to have so many hateful impulses trying to control your soul.

Herriot was even more frightened, and Reinhardt felt sorry for him, because he had no idea what spiritual torment was.

It's already a feat to endure this, but to expect Reinhardt to do more than that is to wish for good luck.

So, Toyo's patriarch proposed a terrible plan to put this burden on Ellen.

Olivia squeezes Reinhardt's hand, her gaze dropping downward.

"What can't be done to me....... I wonder if it's possible for him....... Is it....... be possible......?"

The tone was a mixture of crushing defeat and inferiority complex.

There are many people who would rather carry this burden themselves.

Airi, Harriet, Olivia, Riana, and a few of the Lord Vampires and Sarkegaard.

There are many people who want to carry this burden themselves.

"Why can't I....... not work?"

Olivia said, feeling miserable.

"......I don't think so."

Herriot shakes his head.

"No?"

"I'm just saying that if you can't stand it, it doesn't matter."

"......what?"

The Toyo's householder didn't propose this plan because Ellen can handle what Reinhardt is dealing with.

Leaving aside judgment on Antony's horrific proposal, we don't even need to discuss what Ellen would do if she were offered such a choice.

Ellen will accept of course.

It capitalizes on Ellen's guilt over Reinhardt.

Someone has to make the sacrifice, and most people can't even make the sacrifice.

And if they are swallowed up by the spirits, the damage is done. Everyone needs Edina.

The logic for Antony to sacrifice Ellen is simple.

It's not because Ellen Artorius is so extraordinary that she can handle the souls.

Ellen is bound to be an enemy of Edina and the Devil anyway.

It doesn't matter if you assimilate with the hatred of the spirits, because you're going to be enemies anyway, you're destined to be enemies anyway, you just have to take Reinhardt's burden and make it real.

Ellen is someone Edina doesn't need, and she's ready to make the sacrifice.

Antirrhinus's logic was that it was worth the sacrifice.

"Even if you can't stand it, Ellen, because you're broken. Even if your self is gone, like it doesn't matter because you're the enemy....... That's just a story......."

"......."

Aside from the question of whether it's possible or not, it's really just a matter of doing the math.

Everyone in Edina is needed in Edina.

It would be a shame for any of them to be expelled from Edina for carrying this burden.

So Edina loses nothing by passing this burden on to Ellen, who is destined to be an enemy anyway, and who is willing to take it on.

It's a wild trade-off story.

Ellen might be able to handle it, she might even assimilate.

But because you are extraordinary, you will not die when your body breaks down like everyone else.

At least as much as Olivia.

Reinhardt if it holds up well.

Maybe she can do more than that, but she's only proposing the plan because she's irrelevant to Edina.

So Olivia doesn't have to feel inferior or defeated by Ellen.

I'm not suggesting this because Ellen is the only one who can afford it.

Clearly, Ellen is a good person from Edina's point of view, but not from Reinhard's.

So we have to make up something to fool Reinhardt again.

Olivia's eyes widen and she clutches Reinhardt's hand.

Olivia doesn't like Ellen.

Even more than before, I don't like it.

"......."

But, is it worth it?

Is it okay to make such a suggestion, knowing that Ellen will accept the sacrifice as a matter of course?

"Would you rather I......."

Riana says, looking out the window.

"Maybe I shouldn't be doing this."

Ellen is out of the loop, and the responsibility falls to Riana.

I'd rather have Ellen make the sacrifice herself than have her suddenly make it.

Not to be possessed by those spirits, though the body may disintegrate because the mind cannot bear it.

You should try to do what you're willing to do.

As Riana said those words with a stony expression, her face was filled with guilt and self-reproach.

We don't know if Ellen will be able to handle this or not.

If so, Riana couldn't help but wonder if she'd rather be the one to carry this karma and be banished from Edina.

It was hard for Riana to deal with the fact that someone else was constantly having to carry the burden of her work.

Riana is just what Edina needs.

Antony's logic is that you shouldn't sacrifice, but there's no reason for Riana to follow his suggestion.

"Riana."

Airi calls out to Riana.

"Come over here."

"It's ......."

She places her hand on Reinhardt's forehead and calls him to her side.

"Let me show you what Reinhardt is going through, just for a second."

Reinhardt's image of despair and the soul in the abyss of consciousness.

"I took a quick look, but I don't think I can handle this."

He promises to show her only a small part of the pain, and looks to Riana to see if she's ready.

"That's ......, show me."

If you can handle this, then maybe she's really the one for you.

If even some of them don't make it, she's just going to get screwed.

Carefully, Airi takes Riana's hand.

"......!"

Riana was in a coma for two days for seeing some of that pain.

-grunt

Ellen returned to her normal sword, sheathed her ramen, and stepped over the pile of slaughtered monsters.

The soldiers saluted Ellen, who was clad in silver plate armor.

"Thank you."

"Is this neighborhood cleaned up?"

Ellen looked around the clearing, where the cries of the monsters had died down, and climbed onto the horses drawn by the troopers.

"Yes, we have word from Shanafel that the troop march has just finished securing the area."

"Then I'm going to go back and get my troops."

"Old!"

-Hihihihi!

Ellen puts on her spurs and the white stallion starts to run.

Clad in gleaming silver plate armor, a cloak of the sun, and a sword of the moon at his waist, the warrior races through a field of monstrous corpses.

The fringes of the field were strewn with the carcasses of monsters.

After riding for a while, Ellen could see white smoke rising over the hills.

As Ellen crested the final hill, she saw a vast expanse of open land, with tents dotted as far as the eye could see.

Humanity's greatest army.

Hence, the last army of mankind.

Ellen rode slowly toward the sprawling garrison, smoke from the cooking fires rising everywhere.
