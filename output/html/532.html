            Episode 532.





It was two days later when the tornadoes swept through the neighborhoods of Sankerian and subsided.

Before the monsters could pour out again and fill the empty plain, the Allies had already prepared to march.

Following the end of the weather event, the Allied forces immediately marched into Cencherion.

It was futile.

Divided into three large formations, the Allies attacked the tornado-swept and overgrown town of Sankerian from the east, south, and west.

It wasn't just the monsters that the tornado shrank.

The entire city had been smashed to pieces, and all the facades and rubble of the buildings where the monsters might have been hiding had been swept away.

The Allies would only have to deal with new monsters emerging from cities that had already fallen, or powerful monsters that had survived tornadoes.

And there weren't many of those powerful monsters, and they were swept away like leaves in the wind by the master class of combatants at the forefront.

With three warp gates, Senkerian was never going to be a place with a small number of monsters.

However, they paled in comparison to the size of the Allied forces.

The massive weapons they had brought with them were set up, but they were unable to fire a single shot due to the rapidity with which they entered the city.

It didn't even need to be fired in the first place, as it was meant to be dropped amongst a large group of monsters and wreak havoc.

There was no point in firing on an already decimated group, and there was a greater risk of friendly fire.

The first Allied offensive was over in less than half a day.

A squad led by Ellen Artorius, with two medium-sized warp gates.

One of the large warp gates was destroyed by Saviolin Tana after she smashed through the barrier, ending the battle for Senkerian.

It was a deceptively easy capture.

Allied casualties were less than a hundred.

Casualties, not deaths.

This was because the number of monsters had been drastically reduced, allowing the best and brightest to enter the scene quickly and hit the warp gate.

-grunt

Ellen sheathed her Voidblade as she stared at the remains of the collapsed warp gate.

Of course, breaking down the gate isn't the end of the story. There's still the task of exterminating the surviving monsters, but they're few and far between.

"Operation is over. Thank you for your service."

"It's ......."

Ellen nodded in agreement.

The operation was successful.

Fewer casualties.

Ellen has some intuition as to whose help it was.

Ellen holds the necklace still and steadies her breathing.

When you get home, you'll be cuddling and petting your cat.

I'm going to say that everything worked out better than I expected.

I want it to be like this, and I want it to be like this for the rest of my life.

Of course, that's only possible if you have a cat in your garrison that can sneak away and come back.



* * *



The Allies succeeded in capturing Senkerian.

The Allied Command knew that the timing of the massive natural disaster was no coincidence.

Much of the Allied command, with the exception of the Supreme Command, believed it was an imperial surplus.

It was deceptively easy, but I'd call it a triumph.

First win since starting.

Starting with this, repair all the small, medium, and large cities in Regeln, as well as the capital region, and the gate crisis will be over.

There's still a long way to go.

But there's no reason not to celebrate this first victory.

After clearing out the neighborhood of Sankerian, a banquet was held at the garrison.

There were very few casualties in a battle where a huge number of casualties were expected, so why shouldn't we celebrate that?

Not too much, but the emperor allowed a certain amount of drinking.

The garrison was filled with songs sung by soldiers wishing for a complete end to the war, peace, and the death of the demon.

It was only natural that such a banquet would be held within the Royal Class garrison.

Those who could, took a drink or two, while Lanyon Sessor drunkenly bounced his instrument.

Of course, I'm not that good, so even in my drunken stupor, my playing was inaccurate but fun.

-Ahhhhhh!

The Allies had fought many battles, but this was the first time they could claim a victory.

So it was no wonder that the students were drunk on their own sense of victory.

To keep their senses sharp, or perhaps because they don't think this is a true victory yet, some of them listened to the victory song without letting it dampen their spirits, at least for today.

The Allied lines are stirring.

Not everyone was drunk, of course, but everyone was enjoying the banquet in their own way.

A corner of the Royal Class Garrison ballroom.

-ehhhh

Some of the students were watching a black kitten waddle around on a pile of green leaves.

"This....... Is it okay?"

Ellen's worried gaze alternated between the purring cat and Anna de Guerna, who had brought the unidentified leaves.

"He's fine......."

-ehhh

The cat was curled up in a ball, sniffing the leaves as if he were drunk on something.

Disappearing into thin air, as they always do, the Black Cats sought out the Royal Class garrison after the occupation of Senkerian ended.

The Royal Class students had gotten used to the cat disappearing for a few days, then reappearing, then disappearing for a few days again.

Now everyone was thinking that if they disappeared for a week, they would come back at some point.

But this time, Anna de Gerna laid down some leaves and put the cat on top of them, scaring the cat away.

It's been like this ever since.

Wandering.

Scarlett, Christina, Adelia, and the rest of the Royal Class watched the cat curl up into a ball as if it were drunk.

It sounds like something dangerous, but Anna says it's not.

"Is this what you put on the supply list last time?"

"Yeah....... catnip."

I realized I'd put something weird in the supply list for an important alchemical reagent.

"Deals like drugs for cats......."

"!"

-En

Anna's words startled Ellen, who scooped up the cat purring on a catnip leaf and glared at Anna.

What have you done to my child?

I could read the thought in his eyes.

"Drugs......?"

"It's just a word, not a real drug."

"......really?"

The other senior nodded.

"Yeah, it's not bad for you, I know that."

"......."

-Enter

The cat was still slumped over, still purring. He was not fully awake, like he was drunk, but he certainly looked good, for better or worse.

Ellen nervously placed the black cat back on the pile of leaves.

-Yes

The cat began to curl up on the catnip leaves again.

Of course, only you know what the distraught cat is screaming inside.

A banquet was also being held in the barracks area of the Cernstadt military headquarters.

A hearty meal is set on the table and the victory of the operation is celebrated.

"At this rate, it won't be long before the gate crisis is over, will it?"

"This is way too easy, I don't know why I haven't done this before."

"I don't know why we needed to organize such a large army if it was only going to be this much."

"When this war is over, every last one of those who fought will have gone down in history."

Heinrich listened as the commanders talked amongst themselves.

Alfons, Ruiz, and German were seated next to each other in an obviously formal setting, with Heinrich sitting next to German.

But Heinrich is clearly distant.

"Sister, how far away is the next operational area?"

"They said it's about a week away."

"That's pretty close."

"But it's only a small town. It should be a little easier than this operation. Apparently there's only one small gate, so a shortstop may be all that's needed."

German von Schwarz was talking to Louise with his back to her.

They're clearly turning away.

But Heinrich is not one to be ignored.

"Prince Heinrich doesn't drink, does he?"

One of the commanders, already looking a little drunk, asked from a distance.

"Oh....... I don't really enjoy it."

"Still, on a day like today, shouldn't you have a drink?"

"One drink, maybe......."

"To the Prince!"

He shouts, and the others raise their glasses to drink.

Heinrich reluctantly drank a little of the wine in his glass.

Heinrich doesn't know much about the structure of Cernstadt County.

She follows the orders of her commander, Louise von Schwarz, but she doesn't know the military structure, the hierarchy of commanders, or even their names.

But in the special circumstances of wartime, Heinrich von Schwarz's stature could never be lowered, as he always led from the front and swept away his enemies.

Whoever kills the most enemies has saved those who should have died fighting those monsters.

Regardless of what the royalty sitting on the sidelines think of him, Heinrich has the support of the overwhelming majority of his soldiers and commanders.

Heinrich could feel Alfons, German, and Ruiz's faces harden, though they didn't show it.

The rolling stone is getting bigger and bigger.

Heinrich now understood that it was inevitable that the embedded stone would feel threatened.

But why.

Why this.

I wonder if he thinks he's an eyesore.

"The youngest."

"......Yes, sister."

"You must be exhausted. Go inside and get some rest."

Why.

It's not a very pleasant banquet, but I wonder if they're kicking me out like I don't deserve to be sitting here.

Why do I hate the youngest prince's ode to dance so much?

Why.

I can't believe you hate me this much.

"Yes, sister."

Heinrich swallowed hard at the stirring in his chest and left the barracks where the banquet was being held.

The departing commanders sent words of encouragement to Heinrich von Schwarz, the hero of the Cernstadt army, telling him to make himself at home and rest.

In that nauseating scene of simultaneous praise and command, Heinrich had to get out.

Nightfall Garrison.

There's a banquet going on, and I'll be around for a few days in the name of relaxation, but I'll be leaving soon.

Soldiers could be seen eating and drinking in banquet halls and throughout the garrison.

It's not fun in a ballroom, it's suffocating.

I have a couple of days.

As he watched the soldiers carry food and drink, Heinrich moved toward them.

"Ouch, Prince!"

"Excuse me."

Heinrich took a bottle from a crate of wine that was being carried into the ballroom.



* * *



Alcohol.

The first time I drank it was at Liana de Granz's mansion.

After hearing that Riana had been electrocuted for lying, he realized he had no control over his drinking.

Sure, things were a little weird back then for a lot of reasons.

With a bad first memory, Heinrich didn't bother looking for alcohol.

But I'm an adult now, and no one is going to judge me if I drink.

Of course, Heinrich can't drink alcohol after he reaches the age of majority, so it's his first drink since that day.

In his barracks, slumped in a chair and without a glass, Heinrich gulps down the wine.

Is the original sin of the past as great as this?

It's bound to be big.

You're still doing the best you can in your position.

It was a long time ago, a long time ago that I don't even remember.

The brothers still can't forgive themselves.

It's just a perpetual nuisance.

"Whoa......."

Heinrich can't tell the difference between the wines because alcohol is not his hobby.

However, there was a certain amount of off-flavors that made me realize that this wine was not a commodity.

The Empire still has money to spare, but not much, and the state of the wine in the command barracks indicated that.

Heinrich knows this was too easy.

It was strangely easy.

If we continue to defeat gates with such weird ease, we'll soon see a complete end to the gate crisis.

If so, then.

What happens next.

There are plenty of commanders and soldiers who overly heroize themselves.

Back in Cernstadt, the soldiers will talk about the youngest prince's greatness, and songs will be written about him.

Brothers who hate themselves will hear the youngest's song echoing through the homeland.

Your brothers will kill you.

"Hmph....... 흐......."

Heinrich now realized that the words weren't exactly empty.

I can see it from the side.

Seeing brothers who strangely dislike themselves made me realize that it might happen enough.

They're brothers, after all.

"......."

No matter how hard I tried to push it away, I couldn't help but let it creep in.

Heinrich doesn't know much about politics.

They don't know family.

That's why I don't know why I hate my family so much that I want to kill them.

If you don't know love, you don't know hate.

You can't remember something you've never eaten, so you can't hate it, right?

Heinrich is just frustrated.

Why do you hate me so much.

Are you really trying to kill me.

Heinrich gulps down the rest of his wine and rises from his seat.

If you don't know something, ask.

If you're not sure, ask someone who does.

Heinrich von Schwarz is courageous.

I don't know politics, so I need to find someone who does.

On a whim, Heinrich tries to find someone he hasn't seen in a long time.

Bertus de Gradias.

They're obviously going to stay in the garrison.
