My body becomes a magic scroll.

You don't have to perform complicated maneuvers every time you cast a spell. You simply call upon the runes inscribed on your body and infuse them with magic.

The flesh is the paper, and the letters are the spellbook.

It's not quite casting-free, but it's close.

A never-before-seen magical system that combines runic and scroll magic with the human body.

Louis Ankton, who conceived of the first draft, nailed it when he said it wouldn't work.

Magic has evolved, and runes are overly primitive.

It was simply too inefficient to abandon the developed system and return to primitive methods to implement modern magic in an ancient magical language.

The first step was to reinterpret and translate modern magic into runes. A deep understanding of runes was a must.

Herriot could do that.

The Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan, a magical master, had emphasized the importance of runes from a very young age, so Herriot had a very deep understanding of the language, if not the level of a professional scholar who had spent a lifetime studying it.

But on top of that, I had to memorize a huge amount of runic formulas and activate and rearrange them whenever I needed to.

Herriot could do that too.

Memorization is too easy for Herriot.

As such, Herriot's body, not his mind, was now doing most of the actual work of manipulating magic after the fact. All that was required was to memorize a number of magical runic combinations.

A magical scroll that can be used indefinitely, as long as your body's magic allows.

So while she doesn't have the superpower of no-casting, she has gained an ability that rivals Redina's.

-currr

It wasn't over yet. Herriot reached for the acrid smoke rising from the collapsed stadium.

Blue lines of energy are etched into Herriot's right arm in the form of runes. The greater the scale of the magic, the greater the magnitude of the power lines that color his entire body.

Herriot now had runes glowing all over his right arm, upper and lower.

-currrrr

Magic that is reorganized into runes and triggered.

Thunder.

We'll end with a thunderbolt, not a lightning strike. Sudden darkness descends upon the otherwise clear sky, and the people begin to shout.

-Flash!

A flash of light struck the stadium.

-Crunch!

Soon after, a massive roar shook the stadium as the thunderbolt inflated the air.

In the places where the blows hit, there was silence for a while.

"......."

"ha......."

A moment later, she smiled at Olivia as she emerged from the rubble.

I didn't win or lose, but I was confident that I'd already hit the nail on the head.

Olivia Ranze emerged from the rubble of the collapsed stadium.

"Is this....... I'm really pissed at......?"

Herriot may have gotten the better of her, but that doesn't change the fact that Olivia Lanchester is a monster.

He survived a Flame Strike and a Thunderbolt with his bare body. Flame Strike is a large-scale destructive spell, while Thunderbolt is a small-range but powerful anti-personnel attack.

But Olivia survived both.

The audience was in awe that such high-level destructive magic could be cast, even at the unlimited level, and that there was an opponent who could withstand it.

The smile faded from Olivia's face.

As if the fun were over.

Herriot's right and left arms, which are hidden by his sleeves, begin to draw power lines once again.

The stadium collapsed, and over-the-counter became meaningless.

Herriot will lose if she allows just one attack, and Olivia Lance will lose if that ironclad barrier of enchantment is removed.

The playing field itself is in Herriot's favor.

For Olivia Ranze, who needs to get close, the collapsed and bumpy ground is a tough place to move.

But Olivia is immune to such mundane standards.

Olivia leaps off the ground like a bird and approaches without losing her footing.

Of course, Herriot, who has done the unprecedented thing of imprinting magic on his own flesh, is not by ordinary standards.

Herriot is the point from which Olivia leaps.

Cast a spell, facing the arena floor debris where you will land next.

Casting is a simple telekinesis.

-Puck!

With a dull thud, the rocks on the ground Olivia was supposed to be stepping on suddenly bounced to the right.

"!"

Suddenly, your foothold is gone, so to speak.

-Kwadang!

"Yuck!"

Olivia stumbled to the ground and went from bad to worse.

In the heat of battle, the last thing you want is to stumble and go off the rails.

However, Olivia falls forward in such a ridiculous way that it makes for a rather hilarious situation.

"......pub."

And Herriot, who had created the spectacle, laughed at Olivia for not casting an offensive spell.

"Wow....... Wow really......."

Olivia staggers to her feet and turns to look at Harriet, who has a sneer on her face.

Oops.

I never thought I would be laughed at like this.

For a kid like that.

Only.

I didn't think a wizard would do this to me.

"Really."

"Dog."

"Pissed off at......?"

A dark fire burns in Olivia's heart.

The tendons in the nape of her neck and forehead stand out, and Olivia Ranze grits her teeth and approaches Herriot once again, this time calmly. This time, the same trick didn't work. That was an unexpected attack.

Just being careful isn't enough to stop you from poking holes.

Olivia lunged at him, stabbing him in the back, and Herriot disappeared in a short spatial shift.

But just as he finished moving. Herriot found himself facing a crashing boulder.

Late.

You don't even have a second to cast.

-shhhh!

He dodged it not because of his quick reflexes, but purely because the trajectory of the flying rock missed him.

The velocity of the flying rock was such that if a normal person had been hit, their head would have been crushed to death.

"This doesn't fit."

Olivia's mouth watered with regret.

I knew that if I got too close, he'd spacewalk away for a short distance, so the rock was aimed at the moment he spacewalked away.

Luckily, it was far enough away that it didn't hit.

A chill ran down Herriot's spine.

Your opponent is learning to deal with the same pattern of attacks, loopholes, and avoidance behaviors.

That moment of spatial movement, the short gap between arrival and departure.

In the heat of the moment, your opponent might snipe at you with a rock.

Next time, you won't miss.

This is the last time.

You don't have much horsepower left anyway. You've already used a lot of powerful magic.

"You're starting to look like you're running out of steam, aren't you?"

And Olivia knew that Herriot was feeling it.

-Thump!

Watching Olivia advance, Herriot opted to use a terrain feature rather than an offensive spell.

Use telekinesis to lift and throw debris from the arena.

-Bang! Quack!

Olivia pushed forward, smashing through the rocky debris head-on.

Ellen at least smashed through the wall and cut through the door with her new sword called Ramen.

Olivia Lanze was doing it with her bare body. Throwing stadium debris at the ever-approaching Olivia can only go so far.

But as if it's the only way to go, Herriot throws up a pile of stadium debris, which Olivia crushes as she advances.

So, it's no surprise that the macabre dirt spiked.

Olivia gritted her teeth as she reached Herriot's nose, only to see Herriot slip away with another blink.

"Sucks."

Olivia guessed this was Herriot's intention as she watched the dirt block her view.

This makes it impossible to see which way the opponent has moved. It was so dusty that the audience couldn't see what was going on.

"Whoa......."

In an instant, the blue magic in Olivia's body suddenly exploded.

-Quack!

It's what Savior Tana did when she fought Charlotte the Dark One.

A magical shockwave exploded, blowing away the dirt that had been scattered.

Olivia blew the dust away like she was clearing a fog, and watched as Herriot appeared on the other side of her again.

The stadium was now beyond a mess and had disappeared.

"Nothing more to throw?"

From Olivia's perspective, Herriot's spatial movement seemed daunting, and he'd been using his telekinetic powers to throw large pieces of debris.

But Olivia smashed all the rock-sized pieces.

All that's left are the stones.

Gone are the days of short-range spatial travel and shallow, dirt-stirring escapes.

At this point, you've spent too much time with the little wizard.

"You don't have to throw it anymore."

But Herriot was smiling.

"I threw them all away."

"......what?"

I can't believe I threw it all away.

What the hell?

Suddenly, Olivia realized that despite her magical shockwave, there were stones all around her.

These rocks should have been pushed back by the shockwave, but they stayed put.

Olivia sees.

In the scattered shards, the bits and pieces of stone.

Although we don't know the details.

Anything found in the form of those fragments.

Eerie regularity.

"I've used up most of my magic, but I don't have to use my magic to do this."

Herriot threw the shard.

And he was arranging the scattering shards so Olivia wouldn't notice.

How to use Nature's Mana.

Reinhardt tried to get him to figure it out, but he still can't.

But there is a way to use natural mana in the first place.

In the form of a magic circle.

Magic circles are used for all sorts of things, but large-scale circles use mana from magic stones, but are essentially mana draws from nature.

In this short span of time, Herriot did the unthinkable: he set up a magic circle in the arena.

-Woof

"Holy......!"

Olivia watched, dumbfounded, as the magic circle, already set up over an area too large to escape, began to react.

"I win."

With a smile from Herriot.

Herriot's magic circle glows blue and takes on the form of a complete djinn.





The magic happens.

Inferno.

A fire-based destructive spell that ranks above Flame Strike.

It's too broad a spell to avoid.

Olivia has a hunch.

This is, well, screwed.

Olivia cried out in frustration as she watched the flames begin to rise at her feet.

"You'll see......! You'll see!"

"The wait and see is the scariest part!"

It was too juvenile for a conversation at the end of a long, intense fight.

-Crunch!

A roaring inferno engulfed Olivia and shot skyward.

Olivia couldn't resist the magic this time.

-He, Herriot de Saint-Ouen, takes the second set!

The audience stared in disbelief as the eerie flames licked at the sky like a snake's tongue.



* * *



Herriot was unfamiliar with fighting, but he knew what was important in a fight.

Hide your information as much as possible.

Herriot hid his tricks well. He hid as much of what he could do as he could, and then let it slip away. By making it seem like throwing shards was all he had left, he hid his true intentions of setting up a massive magic circle on the ground.

But in the end, it's a mixed blessing.

Olivia looked down on Herriot too much, and Herriot took advantage of the trick.

Plus, of course, Olivia didn't use her holy power until the end. If she had, she could have survived the final Herriot attack.

In the end, Olivia outplayed her opponent with a lot of constraints.

Regardless of the outcome, the excitement in the crowd was palpable as the most spectacular fight of the tournament so far took place.

The set score is 1:1.

Olivia won't let her guard down now.

Herriot and Olivia have been summoned to the arena that was restored by the Restore spell.

Olivia glared at Harriet like she was going to eat her at any moment.

I will not be caught off guard, I will not be fooled, and I will not be tricked anymore.

So, looking at Olivia waiting for the match to start, Harriet threw up her hands.

"I'll abstain."

Not surprisingly, Olivia's complexion turned white.

"You, you, you, you, don't do it, don't abstain!"

"I'm tired, I can't do more."

Not having enough horsepower is not an excuse.

In Reinhardt's case, he was unable to recover from the effects of his enchantments, but his normal energy depletion could be addressed by a standby mage with a replenishment spell called Siphon Mana.

Declaring a pointless abstention.

-Get....... Well. Due to the withdrawal of Herriot de Saint-Ouen, Olivia Lanche is the winner of Group C of the main draw....... has been determined.

Of course, you can't force a player to fight more if they don't want to.

"Don't abstain! You! I said don't!"

Even when Olivia huffed and puffed, Harriet wasn't in the mood for more fighting.

Harriet can't beat Olivia.

"Yeah, one more set, one more set, and if you win the next set, you win, and I'll quit!"

"No. Why would I want to do that? I can't even fight you."

"Aaaahhhh!"

Her goal was never to beat Olivia, but to make her impossible to ignore.

Herriot succeeded in doing just that.
