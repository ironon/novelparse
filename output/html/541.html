We're not putting Kono Lint in jail.

Antony hadn't asked me to do it in the first place, I'd captured him, and I had no intention of treating him like a prisoner.

In the first place, Kono Lint wouldn't know where the Edina Archipelago was attached, and he wouldn't know anything about it from looking at the landscape.

Of course, that didn't mean it was an open space, just one bedroom in the master suite.

There was no conversation about how long it had been or how I was doing.

We're not in a position or relationship to have that conversation.

"So, you didn't come here on a reconnaissance mission, you just wanted to check things out on your own terms?"

"Uh, uh, uh....... Yeah......."

Konorint nodded slowly.

Even in Temple, the Ganodab triplets, who were all for Kono Lint, scared me a lot.

That hasn't changed now. It's gotten worse.

From school asshole to continent-spanning asshole....... I've become more than that, and if I'm not scared, that's weird. Because even if these guys aren't what they used to be, I've changed even more.

No matter what the circumstances, even being kidnapped, Kono Lint couldn't help but notice the haggardness in his complexion.

It's inevitable that the Allies will notice our presence.

I knew Sarkegar was watching, of course, and that the rumors hadn't spread beyond a certain point, even though I was in the Allied garrison myself.

Shanapels, imperial mages, and a handful of troops tasked with frontline reconnaissance.

That's about as close to the truth as you can get.

The rest of us might recognize that the Empire is hiding some kind of strength, or that it's hiding some kind of important information.

Kono Lint scouted Serandia on his own, without orders from higher-ups, and found us.

"Whatever you saw, it's true. We're trying to deal with the gate situation in our own way, that's all."

"......."

At my words, Konorint stares at me still.

"You're....... devil."

"Right."

I know this now, but when I nodded nonchalantly, Kono Lint's complexion grew even more haggard.

"You caused the Gate debacle....... caused the gate situation......?"

He looks at me, breathless.

What to say.

As it turns out, they're right.

There were many stories and misunderstandings, but in the end, Elise was the one who caused the gate.

It happened to save my life, so I can't say no.

"It turned out right, but it wasn't what I wanted, which is why I'm doing this."

"......."

"I don't want to go into details, and there's no point in doing so, but everything I've done, from when I entered the Temple to now, has been to stop this gate, even though it happened because of me. It's not what I wanted."

I wonder if he'll believe me.

I don't think Kono Lint would understand me if he saw me fight the monsters of the Gate for my life.

This guy lost his family too.

If you're focused on the fact that I caused the gate to happen, no matter how good a reason you had, then there's nothing to hate me for.

"Why did I make you....... Why....... trust you?"

Terrified, Kono Lint stutters, but manages to continue.

"The whole Gate thing was....... You caused it to get back at the humans....... You want the Gate Crisis to end, and so do we....... Maybe that's why you're helping the Alliance, so that when the Gate is over....... to wipe out the humans like you did in Serandia....... If....... Maybe that's what you're doing......."

Conor Lindt continues his suspicions about me.

Monsters attack humans and demons alike.

A gate event occurred to destroy humans.

But if humans perish, demons are next.

So maybe they're grudgingly helping the humans now, and once they've solved the gate situation, they're going to stab them in the back and wipe them out.

Actually, it's a pretty plausible assumption.

It's the same for demons and humans alike that the Gate situation needs to end. So help the Alliance. They're just using the humans until this whole situation is resolved.

"Oh, I like that idea."

"????"

When I suddenly complimented him, Konorint froze.

"I'll use that as an excuse later."

"Excuses. What......?"

There's a saying that goes something like this.

If the Alliance realizes that the Demon Army is helping the humans, they'll be confused, and they'll only work with them temporarily, knowing that they'll have to work against them later.

With that excuse, I'm tempted to go ahead and ally with the Allies.

I mean, at the point of joining forces with the devil, is the coalition going to splinter?

Why people need to convince the devil to cooperate.

It's a good reason to embrace it right now.

People made assumptions about my intentions, and that's what caused all the trouble.

So once again, there's no shortage of educated guesses.

Conor Lindt, who had no idea what I was talking about, stood frozen in place.

Kono Lint is in Razak for now, but he doesn't know where he is.

I was going to let it go.

But before we get to that, let's make sure we're not talking out of our asses.

"First of all, I don't want you to tell anyone that I'm clearing a path ahead of the Alliance or that I'm breaking down warp gates. You haven't seen anything."

"You want me to pretend I didn't see it?"

"Yeah. If word of this gets out, they'll think I'm doing this for some sort of ulterior motive, like you're picking up on now. There is no such thing. I just want the gate thing to be over. I don't have an agenda, I don't have a plan. I'm telling the truth when I say I didn't want the Gate to happen, and if you don't believe me, that's fine, and you have no reason to believe me, but the truth is, what can you do about it?"

The events leading up to the Gate debacle.

I could tell you about it. But there were too many moments that were overly wordy, rambling, and disjointed.

"Are you sure....... You didn't want this?"

"Yeah."

"So like I saw today....... This is how you're helping the Allies?"

"Yeah."

This guy saw it firsthand.

You've watched your armies battle it out in Serandia.

I ended up destroying a few warp gates, and watched as the monster desperately fought back.

Now that you've seen it with your own eyes, you can see the sincerity in my words.

"If this isn't....... If it's not what you did....... If it's not what you wanted....... Isn't it something people should know......?"

Kono Lindt looks at me and asks.

"People know....... and you know it's all because of you."

"Right."

"I know that, and....... I'm still not convinced."

"I suppose."

Some things are hard to believe when you see them.

If I'm kidnapped out of nowhere and told that I'm the cause of everything, that I didn't actually do anything wrong, will I believe it?

You'd be an idiot to believe it.

"Why did this happen and....... If it really wasn't your fault....... you're being unfair."

"Other people need to know the truth. If you're really....... If you're innocent. shouldn't you?"

"I don't think what you said was just....... I don't see why you need to make excuses for me, and I don't see why you need to make excuses for....... I don't see how convincing me is going to....... It's not like anything big is going to happen, so why tell me this......."

"Um, I don't know, whatever."

"Let's assume you're telling the truth. I still can't believe it."

"By the way, if what you say is true......."

"It's not your fault, but everyone says it's your fault....... Is that....... okay?"

Konorint asks.

"Is that okay?"

You can't say you're fine, even if you're dead.

Because it's not okay, in fact, it's not okay at all.

It's just that we recognize that it's unavoidable.

It's just not trying to do something about the inevitable.

"Then....... If you're innocent, people hate you for no reason, and......."

"It doesn't make sense."

"Meaningless?"

"If people know, it's more of a problem."

Knowledge is power.

If you know, it's your problem.

Those who don't know the truth hate and loathe me.

But what if you find out the truth?

They will not abandon their hatred of me, but they will hate Ellen and the imperial family.

I will hate everyone who kept this secret from me and blamed everything on me.

Nothing is gained except the spread of hate.

It's not that we don't want the truth to spread because we have some sort of heroism or noble purpose.

If it spreads, it will only divide and confuse everyone.

In truth, no one benefits. Only he does.

So I'm not going to tell Kono Lint what really happened.

Because finding out will only give you more people to hate.

I didn't want that.

I just want the gate debacle to end.

I'm past the point of wanting them to understand or believe me, but that's all I could say.

"The truth that will divide us all will only bring us all down."

"......."

"If that's the truth, I'd rather not know."

If it's a problem that can be overcome by my frustration, I'll be frustrated.

It's not okay, and I can't say it's okay at all.

But if it turns out to be just not good enough, so be it.

"So, pretend you didn't see it."

That the devil is fighting for the true end of the gate situation and wants nothing else.

It's a truth that will never be understood, and it's even worse when it is.

Sharing this responsibility among multiple people will only create more targets for hatred, and division will only lead to everyone's downfall.

Kono Lindt stares at me, still.

He was silent for a while.

You won't believe me. Because even though I've seen you fight, I need an end to the gate situation just as much as he does.

You can also accept that you're just temporarily helping the Allies, with the consequences to come later.

If anything, I think you're more credible.

To those who have lost something, my words ring hollow.

Even if you can trust me, it doesn't change the fact that I'm the cause of the gate.

"You....... I used to think you were a weirdo......."

Konorint smirks.

"He's even weirder than I thought."

The word "weird" now had a positive nuance to it that was a bit different from the weirdness of the past.

"Yeah, no one's going to believe you if you tell them you were running for your life in Serandia trying to break down a gate, and they're going to tell you that the war made your head hurt."

He laughs hysterically.

In his cat form, Kono Lint has made leaps and bounds in his abilities, but he's still a bit of an idiot.

I do.

If Kono Lint were to tell a story that no one would believe, it would be more than just strange to most people, it would be stomach-churning.

You're going to be told that you've made a thousand dollars and you're going to be told that you've made a bad joke and you've fallen asleep.

"So, does that mean you're going to continue to do this?"

"As far as I can."

We can't openly collaborate with the Allies, so here we are, out of sight, out of mind, and people are going to be suspicious, but we can't let them get away with it.

As long as you're doing something, you're going to do something.

Kono Lindt stares at me, still.

He nods, as if he understood me when I said he didn't see anything.

"Okay, then I'll send you to the Allied garrison......."

"Hey, you know what?"

"Uh."

"That....... Well......."

Kono Lindt shakes his head.

Also, I feel like I'm making a bit of a face.

"It's been a while since....... No, I don't think this is the time to talk about......."

What are you trying to say?

Kono Lint scratches his head and looks at me in confusion.

"Was that you?"

"......?"

What is "that".

What do you mean "was it you"?

It's only two words, and for a moment I couldn't figure out what he was talking about.

No, I think I know what it is, so I don't know more.

a.

No way.

Holy shit?

No.

You answered too late!

Before I could answer, I noticed the panicked look on his face!

"Gee, was that really you?!"

"Oh, no, no, no, no. What's that, what's that, what's that, I have no idea what that is. I have no idea."

This.

No way.

Should I kill it?
