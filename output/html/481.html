            Episode 479.





Rusinil was walking still in the nighttime neighborhood of Port Mokna.

Archdemon.

A new world created by the demon Valier.

A landscape where humans and demons mix.

Rusinil didn't think it was possible.

The age-old hatred between demons and humans was not seen as something that could be resolved.

However, in the end, survival is an absolute necessity for all beings.

The environmental limitations of being an island.

The reality that the continent is overrun by monsters.

Faced with a choice of death or coexistence, humans mingled with demons, creating a bizarre landscape.

It made Lucinil sad that this was only possible after the world had come close to destruction.

The mere fact that such a landscape had been created in the first place, under such circumstances, sent a strange ripple of emotions through Lucinil.

The reasons and causes are complex, and it's Balie who actually created this environment.

But I didn't let that get me down, I tried to make something happen, and I did.

That's why Lucinil felt sad, but also proud and honored.

It was the outskirts, beyond even the city walls.

The monster didn't walk around to see if it was being periodically swept away.

But if there are monsters that come and go, Lucinil is a road vampire.

There is no monster that can threaten Lucinyl with this change.

That's why Lucinil walks the outskirts of Port Mokhna, looking at a world that has changed.

In fact, it didn't look like much had changed.

It's not like there's a dense population of humans on every continent, or monsters all over the place.

All Lucinil could see was a meadow, lit by moonlight, with a slight breeze blowing through it.

A silver-haired vampire strolls through a landscape where the world is so close to destruction that you wonder what's so different about it.

Reinhard disappeared in search of something.

In her absence, the empress struggles to fulfill her role.

Many of the relationships he had were transformed into bizarre relationships mediated by guilt.

Lucinil thinks back to Valier, who seemed to be the same, but who seemed to have changed so much in the time he hadn't seen her.

It's almost as if there's a compulsion not to show weakness.

It's not as subtly cute as it used to be.

His heart must be broken, knowing that his presence has caused a tragedy.

But on the surface, I didn't feel any of that.

You're not showing your true colors at all.

I could feel myself closing off my mind because I couldn't reveal it, because if I started to reveal it, there would be no end to it.

It's as if he has a premonition of an even more miserable fate in store for him next time.

And yet, they act like they have to do something.

"Poor guy......."

Lucinil mumbles to himself.

The Demon has grown stronger.

You can only pretend to be strong with thick curtains drawn over your shattered heart.

He didn't tell anyone where he was headed, but he must have left to somehow overcome his fate.

You can run like a horse that never tires.

She's seen a lot of them.

I saw them running like untiring horses, accomplishing things.

But I've seen more people die of exhaustion after running like that.

Lucinil doesn't know if his fate is to die of exhaustion or to accomplish something.

However, the demon was gritting his teeth and running, never revealing his brokenness to anyone.

You don't want to fail so badly that you fall apart at the seams.

It's not a strength, it's a compulsion.

What's the devil up to.

The poor guy, wandering around in what part of the world?

Relieved of Edina's task, the demon headed off somewhere, as if waiting.

As Lucinil walked through the meadow that night, he stopped dead in his tracks.

-ssh

Somewhere, a breeze was blowing.

"......?"

Lucinil looks out over the rolling hills in the moonlight.

Lucinyl is a load vampire.

A vampire is inherently undead.

It should be dead, but it is alive.

So even though Lucinil doesn't have a soul, it's easier for me to recognize spiritual beings than other living beings in general.

And Lucinil has done more soul research than any other being in the world.

As such, their ability to sense spiritual beings was much greater than other vampires.

An odd sense of discomfort in the wind.

She could intuit that it was some kind of spiritual response.

Lucinil takes a deep breath and centers herself.

-Uhhhhhh.......

-uuuuu.......

Lucinil could read the strange crying and despair in the wind.

Ghosts.

The Vampire Council is also haunted by ghosts. There were ghosts that could not affect living beings, but haunted the ruins themselves.

Lucinil walks slowly over the rolling hills to the place where the ears howl.

It's not like the monster in the gate.

It's a phenomenon that belongs in this world.

But the breeze, which seemed to chill even the wind, made Lucinil walk to a certain place as if possessed.

"What......?"

Lucinil could feel things that other beings could not.

The ghosts of despair and resentment echoed painfully in my ears.

A rural area quite a distance from Port Mokna.

Somewhere between those rolling hills, under a giant boulder.

Some kind of huge, deep pit that looks artificially created.

It was a cleverly hidden cliff, like something you'd never find from the outside unless you were looking for it.

Lucinil intuitively realized that the tune was coming from inside that artificially constructed cave.

Below that pit.

Rusinil saw that there was something nasty going on there.

It doesn't move.

-hhhblack.......

-으우으으으으…….

But I could feel the ghosts, the ghosts that never left this place, and I couldn't count them.

Lucinil narrows her brow and summons a sphere of light down the pit.

It was a pit of unfathomable depth.

Suddenly, Lucinil could see what lay at the bottom of the pit.

"What is this....... What is this......?"

All.

They were charred human corpses.



* * *



Riana has more survivors than she reported to Edina.

However, many of them were never sent to Edina; they became non-existent, unrecognized on paper.

Killed by Riana.

The words shocked Harriet, and Charlotte could only stare at Riana with a blank stare.

"I figured I'd find out someday, but I didn't realize it would be you and not Reinhardt, and not for long."

So far, Herriot and Reinhardt have been clueless, but Charlotte has been able to deduce what happened from a few papers.

Aside from her personal dislike of Charlotte, Riana couldn't help but feel that there was no room for doubt about her abilities.

"Liana....... What the hell are you talking about? Why....... Why would you send people to......?"

Charlotte didn't say anything, but the impact on Harriet was immense.

So far, no one has reported it, and Riana has been killing survivors with her own hands.

If true, Riana would have saved the most lives in Edina while simultaneously slaughtering innocents.

Liana stares at Harriet, her face pale.

"Reinhard, you've almost died many times."

"......."

Assassination attempts on demons are not uncommon. He's come close to dying many times, which is why he's been sharing a bedroom with Harriet lately.

"We can't have any more impurities in Edina."

In fact, there are many people in Edina who hate the Demon so much that they want to oppose or kill him.

So far, though, we've only been able to snap them with force.

Also, without a demon, there is no way to know how the demons that have been coexisting with humans will turn against them.

Liana stares at Herriot.

"If we educate the evacuees about the situation in Edina, do you know what happens?"

"......."

"When you hear about societies ruled by demons and intermingled with demons, do you think there aren't people who would rather die than live in such a place?"

It's not just an opposing force.

These are people who have lost something.

A country ruled by a demon who is the cause of the situation.

There are those who would rather die than live in a place ruled by such a being.

There are those who hate it so much they want to kill it.

But beyond that, there are those who hate the devil to death.

Herriot's lips quivered in despair.

"Liana....... That doesn't mean you have to kill....... There is......."

"Whatever."

Liana looks at Harriet.

"He won't go to Edina even if he dies, and if we force him to go, Reinhardt will be in danger. He's not the only one. Harriet, you've been close to death many times. I don't like it, but so has Olivia. I don't want to fill Edina with extremists, but I can't just send them there without training them, either, because that could be a problem. There are already more and more of them, and they're already in power, and I can't send more of them who could overthrow Edina? I can't do that. What if I don't send them there? What if I have to feed them here for the rest of their lives? I can't do that, either. Do I just kick them out to live on their own somewhere else?"

At best, you'll banish them back to the monster-infested outskirts of your base.

Drive them back to the land of death.

Death or exile.

"Yeah, actually, that's how we used to do it back in the day: if you want to die so badly, go out and die because I don't want to get my hands dirty, and that's how we chased a lot of the survivors back out into the open."

"I thought that if I survived, that was it, but you know what? I think there are some real survivors, and that's even worse."

"Word is spreading that there's a place like this down south, probably through the people I kicked out."

"What do you think will happen if this reaches the Empire?"

"What would happen if the Empire knew of Port Mokna, and the humans knew of our presence on a distant island to the south?"

"There's going to be a war, I'm sure."

"I have made a mistake, a very great mistake, banishing those who oppose Reinhard, who would rather die than enter the dominion of a demon, who know our land, who know our home, and let them live."

"So I haven't made that mistake since."

"It's just, it's just."

It wasn't that they were dead, it was that they were alive.

Rumors of Port Mokna are starting to spread from somewhere, and while it's not known that it's the land of demons, people are gradually learning that it's a paradise in the south.

A demon, a symbol of hate, and a nation of demons.

Humanity's assault on Edina may one day begin.

If an unspecified number of people learn of Edina, the Empire may be forced to go to war with her.

like a demand to execute the Empress.

The faltering Empire may be forced to go to war with the Darklands in order to right the ship of state and unite humanity.

So Riana began to actually kill people who said they would rather die than be under the demon's control.

If they live, all of Edina might be in danger.

"It's not that I didn't try to convince him, I tried to convince him with lies, but even if I sent him to Edina, he would eventually learn the truth."

"I don't know what you two think."

"People hate the devil a lot more than we realize."

"It's common to hate someone so much that you want to kill them."

"They hate it so much they want to die."

Harriet knew, and Charlotte knew, that people hated the Devil enough to want to kill him.

But I could have hated it to death.

What I was doing to save someone was killing someone.

Killing someone to save someone.

Killing someone to protect something.

I had to kill those I had somehow saved, with my own hands.

Riana had been hiding this story for a very long time.

About a year ago.

Sending would-be impure individuals to Edina resulted in numerous assassination attempts on the Demon King.

The increasingly extreme opposition to the Demon King could lead to Edina's overthrow in the long run.

Ever since we realized that information about Port Mokna and Edina was spreading.

Riana has actually killed people who would rather die than fall under her control.

In Riana's hard expression, there was a resolve that could not be broken or dented.

No bitterness, no despair.

I know that if I start getting hung up on that, I'm just going to flounder in a bottomless pit of despair.

All I could see was that he was determined not to think about it.

"Whatever you wanted to know, the truth is this."

Riana looks at Charlotte and says.

"So, what are you going to do now?"

Charlotte stares at Riana.

"Why didn't you tell Reinhardt about this?"

At Charlotte's question, Riana crosses her arms.

"Do you know what that Reinhardt bastard was like for two years?"

"I don't know."

At Charlotte's nonchalant response, Riana narrows her eyes and looks out the window.

"I've never done anything like that, not even tough love."

"......."

"The guy who's supposed to be the hardest on us, he's spent two years with no signs of it, just thinking about what he has to do, moving forward, never taking a break."

Riana stares at Charlotte for a moment.

"She thinks you're the reason she's like this, but you don't say anything, so she knows. That she's struggling beyond words."

"......."

When you save people, you kill people.

"If Reinhardt had known about this, he would have told me to just send him to Edina and let him deal with the death threats and internal affairs."

"I don't want Reinhardt to have to deal with that anymore."

"I'm not going to say this is the best option."

"But."

"I don't even think it was the worst choice."

"Can't I see that no matter how we try to solve this problem, we have only shitty options? So I've made a decision, as the Devil's changeling and commander of the front lines, that Reinhardt will never know about this. He must be rotten to the core as it is, and I'm not going to make him bear more burden and anguish by letting him know about this."

Riana didn't want to give the demon another thing to worry about, as she was sure he already had enough on his plate.

Riana didn't want Reinhardt to be in danger, and she didn't want Edina to be in danger.

So, at best, the people we saved who hated the devil enough to want to die, we actually killed.

Rumors of the carnage here did not reach Edina. Riana handled her people in secret, so even the survivors who made it to Edina didn't know who was missing around them.

Just like that.

Riana saved people, and killed them because she saved them.

Rather, they would have lived a little longer if they hadn't been discovered by Riana.

What it felt like to kill them with my own hands, Riana didn't explain in the slightest.

Just as Reinhardt hadn't had a hard time for two years.

Riana says nothing about the inevitability or pain of killing.

We decided to do that, so we did.

Liana de Granz, so hard you'd never get a needle through her.

The Devil's Changeling.

Charlotte stares at the Thunder King.

"You must be a friend of Reinhard's, right?"

Charlotte asks Riana, still looking nonchalant.

"Right."

"But before we get to that, I assume you realize that this is a vassal relationship?"

"......Yes."

You should think of the relationship as a friend first.

When Charlotte says that they started out as friends, but now they have to let go of that mentality to some extent, Riana has no words to argue. Charlotte stares at Riana for a moment.

"The subjects cheat the lord for the sake of the lord. That's your argument, isn't it?"

It's a bit of a stretch to compare Riana's situation to Reinhardt's, but in the end, they're not all that different.

"Yeah. I guess that's how it goes, so to speak."

"So by that logic, neither Harriet here nor I, the Regent, nor Olivia, the Prelate, nor Airi, the Succubus Queen, can cheat the monarch?"

"......."

"To ease the monarch's burden, to ease the monarch's responsibility and guilt, the monarch shouldn't know about the miserable, dirty things going on in the country, so it's okay to deceive the monarch?"

Charlotte stares at Riana.

"If you deceive like that, if you pull the wool over the eyes of a monarch in the name of serving him, if you report only what looks good, only what's pretty, only what's pleasing to the eye, but you hide the dirty stuff and don't show it to him, and he thinks everything is going well and knows nothing, what do you call a monarch like that?"

"Dark Lord, or not?"

Riana looks at Charlotte with a stern expression.

"Liana de Granz."

"Your intentions may be loyal, but your actions are unfaithful."

"The moment a vassal dares to show consideration for his monarch, and tries to hide and blindfold him, you make Reinhardt incompetent, even if unintentionally."

"Inevitably, Reinhardt won't doubt you, so everything you say is true, and he won't wonder what's behind it. Why? Because you're a public figure, a friend."

"Whatever your intentions, you have proceeded unilaterally without discussing important matters with your lord, and for a very long time."

"Reinhardt trusted you, and you suspected he might fall apart."

"As a result, I betrayed Reinhardt's trust."

"I'm not going to get into a debate about whether your handling of this was wrong."

"But you should have talked to Reinhardt about this, you must."

"That's your fault, that's your mistake."

Regardless of your intentions, once you start cheating your lord, there may be a second and third time.

Riana has deceived the monarch herself, so if there are others who are deceiving the monarch for similar reasons, she cannot say anything to them.

Just like that.

If we assume that every follower of Reinhardt has a few things to hide in order to honor Reinhardt.

Reinhard is an incompetent monarch who doesn't know what he's doing. Charlotte stares at Riana, still and speechless.

You may be a friend, but don't approach it from your friend's perspective.

Riana knows that Charlotte's comment wasn't just to confirm that this was up or down.

"The monarch needs your loyalty, not your consideration."

You can be considerate of your friends and keep them from knowing what they need to know.

However, out of respect for the monarch, it would be treasonous to keep him from knowing what he needs to know.

"The issues and responsibilities of good and evil stemming from the state are for the monarch to decide from below, to enforce at will, and not for you to decide for yourself if you want to take them."

"......."

Charlotte's comment that this would make Reinhardt an incompetent monarch.

That intentions never matter, and that the accumulation of these things will only make Reinhardt an enemy.

Riana was at a loss for words.

He had to admit that his choice, for better or worse, was a mistake that would eventually jeopardize the relationship between the gods and Reinhardt's ability as a monarch.

"So, what do you want to say in conclusion, are you trying to get me removed from my position, or are you trying to tell Reinhard that I've cheated and need to be punished?"

Charlotte responds to his words with animosity, but ultimately an acknowledgment of her mistake.

"I didn't know the specifics, but I had a feeling it was something like that. All I'm saying is, there shouldn't be this kind of secrecy in the future, under any pretense."

She didn't say what Riana had been slaughtering survivors up to this point.

Most importantly, he didn't discuss what should have been discussed with the monarch, but went ahead and did it anyway.

I'm just pointing out the problems it will cause.

"I'm going to report this to Reinhardt, but because of his personality, I'm not going to say that he's going to punish you or remove you from your position."

"......."

"And this is my judgment as regent."

Charlotte looks around.

"Until Reinhardt returns and gives me orders, I suggest we suspend the search for survivors at Fort Mokna."

The possibility of getting survivors isn't completely out of the question.

However, securing survivors inevitably leads to the slaughter of some of them.

You may have the option of continuing this search for survivors because you may be able to save some of them.

However, there is also the option of not saving anyone because you might have to kill someone innocent.

No decision is completely right.

It's just a decision.

"So for now, we're going to stop all activity outside of base defense."

Until Reinhardt makes a new determination, Fort Mokna will restrict activity outside of base defense.

That was the new decision of Regent Charlotte de Gradias.

"Are you comfortable with my decision?"

At Charlotte's question, Riana stares at her.

Eventually, Riana was forced to admit her mistake.

"......Yes, let's do that."

Therefore, we had no choice but to accept the regent's judgment.

When she was done, Charlotte stood up, and Harriet stumbled to her feet.

"Hey."

Riana calls out to Charlotte as she turns to leave.

"......?"

"You know I don't like you, right?"

"......."

At Riana's words, Charlotte stares at Riana in silence.

"There's no reason to like me, only reasons to dislike me, and I'm sure they will."

Charlotte could only stare at Riana as if that was all that mattered.

"Doesn't that occur to you?"

"......what?"

Riana bites her lip, her eyes widening.

Before I knew it, Riana's eyes were red and bloodshot.

After a long moment of silence, Riana mumbles something that sounds like vomit.

"I love you. And that you don't deserve to hate the Empire....... That kind of thinking comes from....... don't you?"

"......."

Charlotte looks at Riana, her eyes wide and bloodshot.

Riana is casting her vacant gaze off into the distance.

Hold still.

Riana knows what happened to cause her father's death.

The Empire killed Lyanna's father, Duke Granz, and blamed it on the Devil.

This is because Duke Granz was one of the key figures in the revolutionary forces.

Revolutionary forces could have plunged the entire continent into a vortex of war.

Furthermore, Duke Granz's location was known to be a meeting place for demons.

The revolutionary forces were willing to join hands with the enemies of humanity for the sake of the revolution.

To avoid war.

To avoid countless sacrifices, the Empire killed Duke Granz, even going so far as to disguise it as the work of the Devil.

For this reason, Riana hates the Empire, and she hates all those involved in her father's death.

For that reason, he dislikes Charlotte, an imperial princess.

But now.

Riana does it for Edina's sake.

In the name of avoiding war with the Empire.

In the name of the devil.

Killed innocents.

It was as if Riana had confessed to Charlotte that she hated the empire and was plagued by the idea that she was not worthy of it.

The logic behind the Empire's killing of Duke Granz.

The logic behind Riana's slaughter of the innocents is exactly the same.

The logic is the same: to avoid more sacrifices.

Riana realizes that her hatred is now unjustified.

As if Reinhardt wasn't feeling hopeless enough, Riana was feeling hopeless as well, having done such a terrible thing with her own hands.

"Well......."

A right to hate.

Qualifications to hate.

"I don't know if hate and hatred require qualification."

Hate and dislike happen even when the evidence is weak.

I wonder if it's just a misconception that people actually hate and loathe demons.

"So if you keep hating me, if you keep hating the empire, it's just the way it is, and thinking about whether you deserve it is......."

Charlotte stares at Riana for a moment.

"Worrying about the moral purity of hate and hatred is itself....... something."

Charlotte shakes her head.

"Isn't that too, too arrogant?"

Your previous hatred and dislike may have been morally pure, but now it may be unjustified.

At Charlotte's suggestion that it was arrogant to even think about it, Riana bit her lip.

"You, I don't like you either."

Charlotte smirked at Riana's reaction.

"It would do no good for a regent to be overly friendly with the king's most important people. Not for me, not for you, and not for Reinhardt."

So I'd rather be seen as an asshole and an inconvenience to you, but someone you can't ignore, he added.

"But that doesn't change the fact that you're a much better person than I am."

Those who believed in Reinhardt.

You didn't believe in yourself.

Charlotte knew that she couldn't bridge the gap forever.

With those words, Charlotte left the Fort Mokna command center.

The power of the regent must be strong.

However, if you get too close to the demon's people, the state will be run without them, and if the regent becomes more trusted, the demon will become less popular.

Charlotte may have control over Edina, but she recognizes the dangers of letting herself get too close to too many important people.

Charlotte believes that she is only the king's substitute, not the king himself.

That's not really what Reinhardt wants.

Of course, Charlotte doesn't think that just because she wants to, she can earn the trust of the Four Heavenly Kings, the Senate, and their leaders any more than Reinhardt can.

The time they've put in is out of Charlotte's hands.

She's wary of such situations, but she doesn't think Olivia or Riana are any more trustworthy than Reinhardt.

However, for them, the regent should be an inconvenience, but one that cannot be ignored.

You can't be too weak and you can't be too strong.

Charlotte was in a position of power.

Just before returning to Razak from Port Mokna.

"Hey guys, I think there's something you should know about......."

"What do I need to know?"

"Yes."

Lucinil also had no choice but to tell Charlotte and Harriet about the grotesque carnage she had seen.

As Charlotte and Harriet listened to the story, they had a vague idea of what Lucinil was talking about.

"Oh, I think that's......."

"Of course......."

"What, do you know what's going on?"

Charlotte thought about it for a moment, and then told Lucinil a short story about what had happened in Razak.

"ah......."

Only then did Rusinil realize what he had seen.

Charlotte's face was emotionless, while Lucyneel and Herriot looked pitiful.

Lucinil thought for a moment, and then let out a long sigh.

"Whatever it is, we're going to have to do something about it."

"We've decided to stop searching for survivors for now."

"No, that's not it."

Lucinil refers to the outskirts of Port Mokna.

"If you're spiritually attuned enough, you can feel it through your skin."

"Listen......?"

At Herriot's question, Rusinil nodded.

"Yeah, ghosts might materialize as the undead, an unexplained curse might fall, or some bizarre kind of recalculation might occur."

Too many deaths have deposited too many spirits in the area, and no one knows how many have died in the meantime.

"I have to do something before it becomes unmanageable."

"If I don't, what happens?"

At Charlotte's question, Rusinil shook her head.

"I don't know."

But the look on his face was serious.

"That's why it's scarier."

Recalculation due to original spirit.

It's a world where wrongful death is everywhere.

No one knew what would happen if they didn't act fast.

With the teleportation scroll, I can go back to Edina and rest for a few days before returning.

However, the teleportation scroll is not infinite. There's a limit to how far you can travel, so it's not like you can get back to Edina in a single sheet.

A teleportation scroll is something that Herriot can barely create without losing sleep and tinkering for days.

I can't waste it, not even for Heriot's sake. If I run out of scrolls without thinking, he's the one who suffers.

The Sren Mountains were as monstrous as the continent itself.

Furthermore, the mountains are so rugged that the monsters that come through here are nothing like the creatures that roam the wilderness.

The terrain is terrain, and the clumsy can't get in.

I was afraid I might fall asleep and be attacked, so I didn't sleep at all.

Being able to pull an all-nighter.

That in itself made me realize that I had become something transcendent, something different from a normal human being.

I didn't want to be in this situation.

However, a mountain range is a mountain range, no matter how fit I am and no matter how much I can't compare to the average person.

Scrambling over rocky cliffs, up steep ridges, and across mountain ranges that were freezing cold at night, I could only go so fast.

Where the hell is Lizaira?

What's the difference between driving into a mountain range and finding a single village like you're heading into the middle of nowhere and eventually finding a handful of oases in a vast desert?

I wonder if I'm wasting my time.

No, you're right, it's a waste of time.

"Whoa......."

You're standing on a rock on a mountain peak, looking out over an endless range of mountains.

When I saw the mountains, which looked as if the sea had risen and fallen, I knew that the moment I would find Rizaira would never come.

If I had known this, I would have gone with Ellen when she said she was going to her hometown.

I have a warrior's bloodline, I'm Nabal, and I have the bizarre notion that if I spend my childhood running around in these pickling pits, I'll become Erhidorgan Artorius.

I don't think Rizaira would have been destroyed by a monster.

But if Lizaira still exists, how is she dealing with the monster?

It is entirely possible that the people of Rizaira also left in search of a new home.

If that's the case, then I'm literally wandering around the Sren Mountains in vain.

I'm pissed, should I set it on fire? As long as I have a flame of fire, I can burn this entire mountain range to the ground.

Then the monsters that are bothering you will burn up or go somewhere else.

"......."

Of course, if I did that, Ellen's mother would kill me on sight.

I was at a loss for words.

I climb down from the rock, and start walking again.

I'm tired.

I want to sleep.

-Kaahhhhhh!

However, out of nowhere, a flying monster was flying toward me.

"Oh my God."

-Woof!

I grip the summoned Tiamata tightly in my right hand and throw it out.

-shhhhhh! Koo-koo-koo!

Flying toward the flying creature, Tiamata unleashed a torrent of divine power from thin air, blasting it to smithereens.

"Huh."

I make my way down the mountain, leaving the blood of the creature that exploded in the air behind.

Lizaira.

Where the hell is it?



* * *



Three more days passed.

The lack of sleep dulled my sense of time, to the point where I was in a trance-like state where I forgot where I was and what I was doing.

We ran out of all the preserved food we had brought with us, so we hunted animals and ate them.

At least I didn't have to worry about starting a fire thanks to Tuesday's spark.

By the time I got to the point where I couldn't find Lizaira and not know what it was, I had climbed the cliff.

A rocky crevice on a cliff, just big enough for a person to fit through.

I crawled in there and went to sleep.

and so on.

Trusting that my gut will wake me up when I'm near death.

It was irresponsible, but I knew that if I didn't go to sleep, I might die.

I couldn't even tell how much sleep I'd gotten.

I don't know if I slept for hours or days, but the important thing was that I wasn't dead.

I crawled out of the rocks, down the cliff, found a stream, and drank water.

The monster crawled out relentlessly.

None of them were deadly, but they weren't anything to sneeze at either.

Some were small, some were deer, and some were flying.

Those that were too close to the spirit body to be hit by physical strikes were lucky enough to be slashed with a holy weapon.

You don't know how many peaks you've crossed.

I was lost in the middle of the Sren Mountains.

Where the hell is Lizaira, and was Ellen's hometown such a hard place to get into?

Or is it somewhere at the beginning of the Sren Mountains?

But I don't know the direction.

Whether Rizaira is closer to the north, west, south, or east of the Sren Mountains.

So I literally felt like I was looking for Kim Seo in Seoul, and all I could do was look around as I climbed each peak.

I'd fall asleep and have no idea how much time I'd spent on it.

I just wandered through the mountains day and night, slashing, slashing, slashing at monsters.

One such night.

"Ha ha....... Ha ha......."

I tore through the swarming monsters, then slumped on a rock at the top of a mountain, covered in blood.

Isn't it possible that Liza doesn't exist?

So isn't all this bullshit actually a waste of time?

After a few days of slaying monsters, I'm approaching 12,000 achievement points.

I can't reach the master class with achievement points.

-Heyyyyyy!

The gusts of wind from the summit seemed to tear at my face and ears.

His clothes were tattered.

I need to get cleaned up somewhere. I've got laundry to do tomorrow.

I came alone because I thought it would be a waste to bring anyone other than myself, but really, should I have brought anyone else?

Some high peak, unnamed.

I think this is the highest peak I've ever climbed.

I sit down on a rock and stare up at the night sky.

Before I knew it, the full moon was shining brightly.

Ellen's mother.

Luna Artorius.

She made the full moon enlarge as if to move the world, then drew a sword from it.

It was a surreal sight to behold.

I still don't know if it's magic, psychic, or where the hell it comes from.

But.

The name Luna.

I couldn't help but think of the name meaning moon, in front of a full moon.

Where is Lizaira and.

Where is Luna Artorius.

I, really can't find it there?

I'm not Ellen.

How to become a master class in your own right, I don't know.

I'm not Ellen Artorius, so I don't know how to teach myself a master class in enchantment.

So someone needs to tell me.

Grabbing anyone.

Because I don't want to die.

I know it's best to sacrifice my life for the ending, but I don't want to do it.

I need to find it.

Someone who can guide me.

That someone.

I stand still and look up at the moon.

"......Luna."

If you call to the moon, it will come.

If you look at the moon and shout.

If you appeal to the full moon.

"Luna Artorius."

Can I find Liza and Luna Artorius?

I reach for the moon, vaguely.

"Mother."

Frustrated and pissed off.

"Mother!"

Shout.

"Come on out, I'm watching you, I'm watching you, I'm watching you, come on!"

Desperate.

"Mommy, mommy, come out, I know you're watching!"

-MomAhhhhh.......

-Maaaaaaaa.......

Shot.

I'm getting old.

I stood still, listening to the embarrassing echoes of what I had spat echo over the ridge.

What to say.

That moment when you realize you're glad no one heard you.

"......me."

"!"

Suddenly, I heard a voice in the back of my head.

It's a voice you've heard before.

"Why the hell do I have to listen to that?"

Let's look back.

"Mother?"

"So....... Why would I......."

There was a face there, a tired face, a face that was familiar, but not familiar enough.

Luna Artorius.

Again, it was watching me from somewhere.
