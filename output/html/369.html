            Episode 369.





Word has spread across the Imperium that demons have attacked Raziern in the southern Kingdom of Levaina.

Technically, they were raiding a merchant guild branch outside of Raziern, but the demons were actually raiding Raziern as well.

But the damage was not great. The number of demons attacking was very small.

However, there was a very high casualty rate at a location in a remote area that was not guarded.

The Merchant's Guild branch outside of Raziern was the place to be.

The list of victims included the name of Duke Arthur de Granz.

Sarkegar has already been briefed.

You've been taken advantage of by Bertus.

I was wondering why the imperial government hadn't figured out about the revolutionary forces, but they had, they just hadn't realized it until now because they were afraid of the trouble they might cause.

In the case of the raid on the Nameless Order, the mere fact that it was a demonic raid overshadowed everything else that was suspicious, and Bertus had a different opinion.

We decide that this is the way to get rid of the revolutionaries.

In the current context, the name of a demonic nemesis is a kind of evil source that can cause any event to happen at will and blame it all on itself.

The remains of a rigged battle, strewn with the corpses of demons. A large number of human victims. Newspapers with photos of the scene and the names of the victims.

I stared at it wide-eyed.

Duke Granz.

Arthur De Grants.

He was killed in a demon attack in a small country in the southern part of the Empire.

"Why the hell is this happening......."

Harriet covered her face and wept as she remembered the day she'd just spent with the Duke of Granz.

Ellen squinted at the newspaper. As if trying to make sure she wasn't looking at the wrong thing.

"Let's go see Riana."

Ellen said, putting the newspaper down.

-shoot

Winter rain was falling.

Me, Kliffman, Adelia, Harriet. Ellen.

We came to the Duke's house to visit Riana.

It would take time for the body to be recovered and returned to the duchy, and there were already a lot of people in Granz.

I'm not sure if they're relatives or not, but the Duchess's vacant expression as she's surrounded and comforted by so many people speaks volumes about the shock she's feeling right now.

Riana was no exception.

"Huh? Ah....... Wow, you're here?"

Herriot held Riana's hand still, but Riana looked like she wasn't quite sure what was happening to her.

Riana was frozen. She should be sad, but she doesn't even realize what's happened to her.

No one knows what to say to comfort them.

The people next to the Duchess were saying something, but we didn't know what to say.

I.

I didn't know what to say to Riana, who had just been through something that wasn't my doing, but had become my doing.

I didn't.

I didn't do it.

But I can't say that.

Herriot held Riana's hand still, and Ellen put her arm around Riana's shoulders.

"......."

Riana could only stare blankly into space with unfocused eyes.



* * *



We stayed at the Duke of Granz.

The duchess, who is sensitive to returning home, was not sharp with those of us who stayed at the mansion during this time.

But at least she was an adult.

"Thank you, everyone. Riana, please."

She seemed to be purely grateful that we were here to take care of Riana's condition.

Unlike Riana, the Duchess cannot remain in mourning. When the body is recovered, she must organize a funeral. To do so, she must speak to the many people who have come beforehand. In the midst of all this, someone has to be in control, and that's the Duchess.

The next day.

Duke Granz's body has been recovered and returned to the duchy.

Riana stared wide-eyed at the Duke's coffin as it was brought in.

Like you know what's in there, but you can't believe it's really there or not.

The Duchess staggered over to the coffin and opened it once to take over the body.

-Ahhhhhh!

We all stared, dumbfounded, as the Duchess slumped back into her seat. Riana watched in disbelief.

"Oh, Dad....... Dad......?"

Riana staggered closer to the coffin. Herriot stared after her, unable to stop or catch her, a pitying look on his face.

Riana casts her gaze down the half-open coffin.





Riana didn't cry.

Just.

I stared at the coffin in a daze, as if something had hit me too hard.

Soon.

-Uh, ugh.......

A stifled groan escaped Riana's twisted lips.

-Ugh, ugh...... ugh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!

Riana began clawing at her hair.

And.

-Flash!

Eerie thunderstorms began to streak across the pale winter sky.

-blink!

-Currrrrr!

The dozens of lightning bolts that lit up the sky and the fierce thunder that followed thankfully didn't hit the ground.

-Ahhhhhhh!

However, it was clearly not a normal weather event.

Psychics awaken their powers under extreme stress or extreme circumstances.

Just as I reinforced the self-implication a few times like that, and eventually blossomed the ghost.

Liana de Granz was no exception.

There were dozens of bolts of lightning streaking across the sky right now, and it was anybody's guess as to whether Riana would lose her cool and send a bolt of lightning crashing to the ground.

Everyone had already realized that the freak weather was coming from Riana.

The sky is going crazy.

We need to stop Riana.

-Pajik, pajijijik!

Blue sparks began to burn fiercely around Riana's body as she racked her brain, torturing herself.

This is dangerous. The people around the coffin might be swept away by Riana's rage.

Before I could say anything.

-shhh!

Ellen ran through the rain toward Riana.

-Digitize!

The current that had begun to surge around Riana was cut through by Ellen's bare, magically enhanced body, and she landed her blade squarely on the nape of Riana's neck.

Without a moment's hesitation, Ellen plunged into the fray of thunderbolts, one of which could kill her.

-Puck!

Riana's body collapsed, incapacitated in an instant, and Ellen took it lightly.

Everyone stared at Ellen in disbelief, not sure what had happened.

Ellen's quick thinking prevented what could have been a secondary catastrophe.

Ellen looks at the Duchess and says

"I'll take you inside."

"Uh, yeah....... And, thank you......."

The Duchess looked at Ellen with a complicated expression and nodded.

In the mansion, in her own bedroom, Riana opened her eyes a moment later.

"......."

Riana felt a headache, like her head was whining.

Her body felt as heavy as soaked cotton. Riana stared blankly up at the ceiling.

It could be a dream.

It might be a bad dream.

When I drink too much, I often have bizarre dreams.

So, I don't know when I drank or when I passed out, but this could all be a dream.

Riana feels a vague breeze.

I dream for a long, long time, so it's an extension of that.

In fact, all you hear is an unrealistic sound, like something snapped, and suddenly your dad is dead, and the coffin is brought to the front of the mansion, and inside it.

All those times you saw something you never wanted to admit.

I woke up from a bad dream because I saw something like that.

I wanted to believe that.

"I'm tired of Mom and Dad treating me like I'm the only reason their failing marriage has to stay together.

I'm going to take that back.

I shouldn't have treated him like that if I thought it would be the last time.

So from now on, no matter who you're dealing with, no matter who you're meeting.

I need to think a little more, be a little more considerate, and say a little more, because this could be the last time I see this person.

Especially for my dad.

Because that's what I realized.

I apologize for what I said, and I promise to be the daughter who at least stays out of the way, not the daughter who makes things worse in a marriage that's already bad.

I regret all the times I ignored him and gave him a pat on the back for trying to do something.

I'm going to be different.

If only it were a dream.

Just like that.

I think.

It's not a dream.

It can't be a dream.

He clutched his right and left hands, one by one, as he stared blankly at the ceiling.

One is Adelia, the other is Harriet.

If it was all a dream.

There's no way these kids are looking at them with such concern and holding their hands.

Riana squeezed her eyes shut.

If it wasn't a dream.

I'd rather run away to my dreams.

I couldn't even do that.

A miserable tear slipped from between Riana's closed eyes.

-shoot

Duke Granz's funeral was held.

There were men digging in the rain, clad in raincoats, and a priest sent by the Tuan Order stood with a scripture.

He was chanting a prayer, talking about the tranquility and rest of the dead, the purification of the soul.

After the service, mourners lined up to throw flowers into the pit.

Without an umbrella, Riana watched the spectacle with wide eyes.

Unable to cry, Riana stood in the cold winter rain. Herriot tries to put an umbrella on her, but she refuses.

Like you're punishing yourself.

As she stood in the rain, bare-chested, Riana's eyes were filled with a myriad of emotions.

The Duke of Granz was, after all, a powerful nobleman before he became a revolutionary.

Many nobles came to pay their respects, dressed in black, and spoke to the Duchess in mourning about his death.

And.

Among the mourners were first-year Royal Class students.

"......demons."

Ludwig, dressed in black, stood in front of the Duke's coffin, eyes narrowed and lips pursed in pure rage.

"Unforgivable."

I could only stare in silence as Ludwig walked away from the flowers, his eyes glowing with anger.

Regardless of their personal connections, all of the first-year students came to pay their respects.

Among them, of course, was Charlotte de Gradias.

"......."

Without looking in Riana's direction, Charlotte tossed the flowers, took a moment of silence, and walked away. Charlotte made brief eye contact with me, but said nothing.

For her escort, Saviolin Tana was also on hand.

She didn't even lay a wreath.

In this situation, there is something that only I can see.

It looks like Chanapelle has accomplished her mission.

Otherwise, there's no reason for Charlotte to have that look on her face.

There's no reason why the look in her eyes and the expression on her face when she sees Earl gone should be so strange.

There's no reason to put on a guilty face when there's no reason to feel guilty.

Naturally, Mr. Effinghauser and Mr. Mustang came to visit.

Regardless of the fact that he was a Black Order, he was doing his job as a teacher.

When Ms. Mustang saw that Riana's ice was gone, she wiped away her tears with her handkerchief and gently pulled her into a hug.

After the tribute, Mr. Effinghauser stood in front of Riana.

"If you need help, you can always find me."

"It's ......, sir."

Riana mumbled the words blankly, as if she were an answering machine, and didn't seem to think about the words themselves.

Dr. Effinghauser left me with those words and exchanged a brief glance with me.

He didn't say anything to me.

However.

Somehow, I felt like he knew this wasn't me.

And.

Bertus de Gradias also came to the tomb to pay his respects.

"......."

Bertus tossed the flowers on the grave and stared down at the coffin in silence.

Bertus stood before Riana next.

Looking at the frozen Riana, Bertus seemed to be thinking about something.

Bertus was acting for the Empire, which is what he was supposed to do.

But they framed me and killed Riana's father.

I couldn't say it wasn't me, and Bertus wouldn't say it was him.

Bertus turned to Riana with a stern look on his face, and said something to her as he too was caught in the rain.

"I'm sorry to hear that. Riana."

"......."

It was a statement.

I'm the only one in the room who can tell the difference.

Riana gritted her teeth and took a deep breath, realizing that she was in front of the prince.

"No....... Thanks for coming. Bertus."

Riana was thanking someone she should never have thanked.

I couldn't look Bertus in the face.

No matter what expression he had on his face, I couldn't help but punch him in the face.

Amidst the tributes of countless mourners, Duke Granz's coffin, nearly covered in white flowers, began to be filled with earth.

"I'm sorry, Dad."

Winter rain streamed down Riana's face.

"I'm sorry, Dad."

Despite the bitter cold and the fact that her lips were chapped, Riana stared straight ahead at Duke Granz's tomb.

"I did it all wrong."

What's so sorry. What is so regrettable.

Eventually, Riana began to cry a steady stream of clear tears that could not have been rainwater.

"I....... I was wrong......."

So I'm asking you to come back.

I'm good now.

I'm not going to be a bitch.

Now you know.

I'll do better in the future.

Why can't you come back?

Riana muttered to herself as she watched the mounds of dirt pile up over the coffin.

Of course.

Duke Granz never returned.
