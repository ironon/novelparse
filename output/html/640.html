Anna tells him to turn back without saying anything, but no one turns back for no reason on the battlefield.

Unless you're like Ludwig, who was irreparably injured, you can't get permission. If you are forced to leave, you are of course guilty of desertion.

Anna just told Scarlett that she shouldn't be here without really explaining why.

The good news is that Scarlett knows that Anna is not a bad person at heart, no matter how sullen and dark she may be.

Anna wouldn't have said that for no reason.

That's why, Scarlett told her teacher, Mr. Mustang, who is now the military officer in charge.

It's so hard, so painful, and I just want to quit everything.

Send it to the template.

I'm a bomb that only goes off on the friendly side, and if I stay on the battlefield I'm going to cause an accident.

Scarlett didn't mention any of that in the end.

Why Anna does it.

There's a reason she told me never to tell Christina.

There must be a reason for that desperate look in Anna's eyes.

Ms. Mustang was understandably puzzled.

She was surprised when Scarlett, who had been doing her job without complaint, suddenly said she was tired and asked to be let go.

It was literally a no-brainer.

In an army at war, a soldier begging to be sent home doesn't work, and there are plenty of soldiers who do.

And if they are allowed to go home as they wish, the coalition will be untenable.

Some people want to stay because of the food they eat in the military, but others want to quit because they've seen the horrors of death.

So Scarlett couldn't just go back to asking him to let her go for no reason.

But more importantly, Scarlett is no ordinary student.

As a member of the Temple Royal class, he has accumulated a number of majors far beyond those of the average soldier.

And Mr. Mustang misunderstood Scarlett.

So far, I've been able to keep it together, but it's a lot of work and it's hard.

I didn't express it, but I knew it was hurting, and this is how it would eventually come out.

'Yeah, you've been through a lot, Scarlett. I'll talk to the higher-ups. After what you've done, you can go home and rest, and leave the rest of us to do the rest. Don't feel guilty, you've done enough. You've done enough.

'Teacher.......'

That's why Mr. Mustang comforted Scarlett with those words.

In the arms of Ms. Mustang, who had a good reason but wouldn't say it, and who held her warmly despite her childish pleas to go home, Scarlett couldn't help but break down and cry.

So in the end.

Scarlett was able to return to the ecliptic gradient through a warp spot immediately afterward, with no real explanation as to why.

So I didn't even get to say goodbye to my friends.

Only Anna's words.

Don't say anything and go away.

Because I believed the words meant something.



* * *



Normally, the return of a soldier from the military shouldn't be a big deal.

However, in a royal class with fewer people overall, someone's vacancy tends to come out of nowhere.

So it was inevitable that there would be an uproar over Scarlett's seemingly trouble-free departure without a word or goodbye.

An army on the march pauses for a moment to eat.

"Scarlett's back, suddenly?"

Lanyon Sessor shook his head as he ate his dry bread and listened to Kono Lint tell the story.

"I didn't see him, so I wondered what happened, and he said he went back."

Being casually curious about everything going on around Kono Lintja, I was the first to notice Scarlett's absence.

"What's going on?"

"Well, I don't know, maybe he doesn't talk and it's just piling up in there."

Erich, who has never been on good terms with Scarlett due to past grudges, was not happy.

They've both crossed too many firing lines to discuss the bully they once were. They're both too different people than they used to be.

But old guilt and resentment don't go away.

Erich munches on his biscuit, stony-faced at the news of Scarlett's rear-guard action.

As it was a break in the march, we were eating preserved food in the field without a mess hall, so we were all sitting in a circle.

"I thought you looked sick, but if even the priests can't touch you, something's seriously wrong, and you have to go back to the ecliptic......."

Christina sighed as she remembered the last time she'd seen Scarlett, just yesterday, she'd looked gaunt.

If the condition is beyond the priests' holy powers, it makes sense that Scarlett would return.

Anna remained silent and ate her bread in silence, making no comment or addition.

People, not so much anymore.

At some point, Ludwig and Ellen stopped coming to the table to eat separately.

Heinrich is more often than not traveling with the Cernstadt forces these days.

In Ivia's case, she's the messenger for the command center, so she has the hardest time seeing faces.

As such, the second-year royal class was largely absent.

Louis, Anna, Christina, Adelia, Konor Lindt, Erich, Kaier, Klippmann, and Lanyon Sessor.

There were twenty-two people in Classes A and B combined, and now there were only a handful left.

"Where did he get sick? Did he?"

At Lint's question, Christina nodded.

"It didn't seem serious, so I gave him a tonic, but it didn't work?"

Anna tried to silence Scarlett.

And indeed, Scarlett did as she was told by an incomprehensible Anna.

But alas.

Scarlett only spoke of the Archduke's golem, not who had taken her to the Archduke's camp.

"Hmm? I don't think he went home sick, so I don't think I have to worry about that."

What Anna didn't realize was that the secret would only be kept if she silenced Adelia as well.

Anna's eyes widen at Adelia's sudden words. Anna looks at Adelia with desperation in her eyes.

But you can't say anything with your eyes.

"Not sick, then what is it?"

"Oh, that's actually......."

Anna could only watch, biting her lip, as Adelia opened her mouth.

After Adelia explained everything that had happened, Christina's eyes widened.

The same was true for others.

Scarlett's powers, which were once immune, can neutralize other things.

So, upon further reflection, everyone panicked when they realized that Scarlett could potentially disable the Titan, even by accident.

Abilities that are actually more dangerous to allies.

So when Scarlett said she had to leave in a hurry, we all nodded in disbelief and understanding.

"That's why I joined the march today, to see if Scarlett is really back."

Everyone's happy.

If it wasn't because I was sick, I wouldn't be able to do it.

Louis listened, frozen in place.

But her reaction was a little different.

"Oh....... You did......?"

You feel like you've found something.

Like you've confirmed something.

Adelia has no idea, but she can't help but feel creeped out by the look in Christina's eyes.

Christina smiles meaningfully and turns her attention to Adelia.

On the other end of that gaze was Anna.

"Secretly said something about......."

Anna looked down and trembled. Louis Ancton was watching her, too.

"A secret story? What's that?"

At Adelia's question, Christina smiled.

"No, there is such a thing."

"......."

Adelia felt a strange sense of discomfort at the sight, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it.



* * *



After a while.

Just before the army left, Christina sat on a rock.

Louis was speechless at this point, and Anna stood in front of Christina.

"Christina, I'm....... not......."

"Like that?"

Christina shakes her head.

"Did you intentionally hide something from us that we should know?"

Anna had no answer to Christina's question.

"Did you think I was going to do something bad to Scarlett if I found out about it, and that's why you were so scared?"

Anna flinches at Christina's directness and shudders even harder. Christina rises from the rock and approaches Anna, who has her head down.

In front of Anna's bowed head, Christina bows her head even further, forcing herself to make eye contact with Anna, who is looking down.

"I can't help it that you look at me like I'm crazy, but you do realize that I didn't do all this alone, right?"

Watching Anna's eyes roll back in her head, Christina whispers.

"I don't know if it's weird to do something crazy and go crazy, or to do something crazy and act like you haven't done anything yet, Anna."

Immortals were created together.

We also decided to join forces with the Black Order.

"You're not trying to tell me that you want to stop now, you're not trying to tell me that you want to quit now that you've gotten this far......?"

"......."

"Why do you look like you're trying to pretend you have nothing to do with...... these days?"

"I am....... Christina......."

"Isn't that the worst thing......?"

Anna, who looks like she's about to burst into tears, is pulled away from Christina by Louis, who pulls her toward him.

"Stop it. Even Anna....... idea."

"Why, you think I'm going to do something bad to Scarlett if she finds out about this, too, because she can neutralize the Immortal?"

The mere sight of the anger, malice, and madness in those eyes made Louis' heart race.

"Christina, that's not what I meant."

"......."

"Calm down. We need to, uh, calm down."

Christina gritted her teeth at Louis' earnest, understated words.

As if you're trying to suppress something.

As if you're trying to force something that won't budge, as if you're pressing and pressing and pressing.

After a few moments, Christina blows out a breath like she's gagging.

"......Yes, I guess I was harsh. I'm sorry."

"I'm sorry, Christina, I didn't....... I didn't want to get too many people to know......."

But Anna nailed Scarlett, telling her that Christina should never know.

Knowing what she was lying about, Anna's fingertips trembled.

"There's no way I'm going to hurt Scarlett, because that's not possible, and then it doesn't make sense that I'm doing this, because if I do what I set out to do to save Asher, and I hurt Scarlett, and I hurt my friend, I can't do that, and then it's weird, of course."

You might be able to save your friend's life.

Those are the hands I've held and the things I've done.

If you get swallowed up in it and end up hurting your friends, you're negating the whole thing.

When Christina comes to her senses, Anna begins to shake and burst into tears.

"I'm sorry, I was anxious....... I was so, so scared....... I was so anxious......."

Christina cautiously approached Anna and began to comfort her.

"I know, I know, I'm a little off. No, not a little, but a lot. Admit it. Admit it. I'm not going to say I'm sane, either. Of course not. I can't help it that you're so worried, yeah. Yeah."

"黑....... 흐흑....... ugh......."

"I admit it, I was weak. Not strong, like you guys, who can go through all this and still think straight. I was weak....... I was weak, and that's why this happened."

I was weak and I went crazy.

She knows that Louis and Anna are stronger than her, and that's why she can still be so rational.

Weak and broken.

It was weak and drove me crazy.

What was tolerable for someone else was unbearable for him.

The truth that was bearable for others was unacceptable for him.

However, a crazy person is not necessarily irrational.

"But....... You know there are traitors in the Alliance."

"......."

"......."

"The Crusaders already fell months ago, so why not the other side? That's probably too optimistic."

Through Ludwig, they know that the Five Great Orders have been taken over by the Devil.

Now, months later, the devil has probably increased the number of traitors.

Maybe a third.

Maybe half.

Or. everyone but them.

You may have already made enemies.

"We can't be the only ones who know Scarlett has these powers, there's bound to be someone who wants to use her somehow, and the Devil knows about her powers in the first place."

That Scarlet's abilities can be used in that way.

Reinhardt knew about Scarlett's abilities from the start.

But what if you realized that power could be used to disable Immortals the same way it disables golems?

"I'm not trying to hurt Scarlett."

"......."

"We have to protect Scarlett."

The devil will try to take advantage of Scarlett.

So you have to honor it.

"That's why I was angry, not because I hate you."

Anna wipes her tears away and lifts her head to meet Christina's eyes.

I have to protect Scarlett. To tell her I'm sorry that she's upset because I didn't tell her something important.

"My heart....... You know?"

But the look in his eyes said he was worried about his friend.

It was too dark, and I could only see ominous shadows.
