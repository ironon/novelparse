-Kwalung!

The blinding flash did more than burn the wood chips, it exploded them.

-Woof!

Then, as the inflated air was pushed out with a sharp whoosh, Dr. Effinghauser nodded in agreement.

"Thunderbolt......."

Riana watched the splintered wood with a calm expression on her face.

An outdoor training ground for experimenting with great destruction spells.

It's vacation time, but Dr. Effinghauser is consulting with Liana de Granz and checking on her abilities.

Liana de Granz's ability was to work with electricity.

But now, it's been turned into a lightning bolt from the sky kind of ability.

It wasn't nearly as instantaneous as it usually is, and it took some mental focus, but clearly Riana had dropped a lightning bolt.

"It is possible that your powers have evolved into weather-related psychic abilities. We'll have to figure that out."

Riana was still able to handle the battlefield. However, after Duke Granz's death, Riana's abilities changed.

"Don't worry about me, just maximize the abilities you already have."

"Yes."

Ms. Effinghauser stepped to the back and watched as Riana practiced her abilities.

An electric field formed around Riana's body, and it began to explode around her.

-Crunch!

Maddening currents of electricity rampaged around Riana, stretching out in all directions as if they were alive, as if they wanted to burn everything in their path.

We've added the ability to summon lightning while maximizing existing abilities.

"That's enough."

"Adjusting....... difficult."

"That will get better."

The power of the ability itself has been greatly amplified, but as a result, Riana, who is a longtime master of controlling abilities, has lost the delicacy of handling the ability itself.

Dr. Epinhauser was forced to stop his experiments when a series of thunderclaps threatened to shake the temple and the entire ecliptic.

-Pagic!

Mr. Effinghauser stood in the middle of the training grounds in a puff of white smoke, watching as Riana held up her right hand in a blank stare and fired off shots into it.

Riana slowly walked out of the training center and stood in front of Effinghauser.

"That's not enough, is it?"

You didn't ask what was missing, but we don't know what that means.

Plural.

You also don't need to ask who it's against.

Discuss sufficiency.

This is more than enough, it's too much.

For now, the devil is only seen as an absolute in people's fantasies.

"I suppose."

However, EpinHauser was not in a position to tell that truth.

"But it's already a threatening enough ability, use it with caution."

"Yes."

At Effinghauser's words, Riana holds still and generates an electric current at her fingertips.

"Sir."

"Tell me."

Riana hadn't thought much about her powers until now. She never thought she'd have to fight for a living.

"This is the first time I've ever felt like I'm lucky to have what I have."

Blitz.

A superpower that specializes in offense more than any other.

Its speed, destructive power, and killing range are unrivaled.

For the first time, Riana was grateful that she had this ability.

Effinghauser watched Riana, mesmerized, as she stared into the blue light.

Riana's abilities have grown by leaps and bounds.

But that's not enough for Riana, who wants to take on the mighty name of the Demon King.

More.

More.

It has to be stronger.

"Can I be enchanted too?"

It's not just about ability.

He seeks to make the strength of pure flesh his own.

"You'd be better off specializing in your organs. If you try to enchant them, you won't be able to do this or that."

"Reinhardt did."

There is a precedent of Reinhardt, a psychic who didn't rest on his laurels and went on to enhance his powers. Reinhardt is a special case in many ways, but that's not what Riana sees.

Be strong.

If so, you need all the power you can get.

Riana felt compelled to be blinded by strength, to not be weighed down by the name of a demon.

Late start.

They just have a different starting point: superpowers. While others strive, Riana has spent her time complacent and unconcerned about the future.

Now, if you're going to try, you should try harder than anyone else.

Effinghauser looks at Riana and says simply, "I'm sorry.

"I wouldn't say it's impossible."

Riana nodded, as if that was all the answer she needed.

"What would you like to do?"

I was in my room in the dorm talking to Sarkegar.

I was used by Bertus. And by Owen de Getmora. But Bertus said, as we had talked long ago, that an empire needs enemies.

Remnants of the Demon King lurking somewhere.

It is what keeps humanity together. Where the Darklands used to be the enemy, the Empire now seeks to unite under the new concept of terrorism.

This may not be the last time we'll see the devil disguised as the devil's work.

Obviously, we don't want to touch Bertus.

However, the Merchant Guild Master.

The betrayer of the revolutionary forces and the one who will now consume them.

I had to decide what to do with him.

"I don't like it, but the Empire seems to have decided that we are a necessary evil. They don't think our power will ever be fully rebuilt, and that's arrogant."

There was anger in Sarkegar's tone.

A fallen enemy nation, not even treated as an enemy nation, but as a mask for the Empire to use at will. Sarkeghar found it infuriating.

Owen de Getmora.

He must know that his life is in danger. We can't touch the prince, but getting rid of him shouldn't be too hard for us.

The moment he decided to take advantage of us, Owen stuck his neck out.

If you kill Owen de Getmora, you can stop the Imperials from swallowing up the revolutionary forces.

However, if a chaotic revolutionary faction starts to organize after that, that's not what I want.

Sarkegaard might as well be hoping for chaos.

Removing the leaders of the revolutionary forces and bringing them under control is not Bertus' only strategy.

I had a strong feeling that my reactive response was also within the scope of Bertus' plan.

Kill or save Owen de Getmora.

By choosing between the two decisions, it's clear that Bertus is trying to determine the disposition of the Demon Remnant.

In the case of Leverier Lance, the Imperial Court would still be unconvinced that I had killed Leverier Lance with any real intent.

The imperial family is still confused as to the intentions behind the events that have turned out so well for the empire.

If I kill Owen de Getmora and disrupt the revolutionary forces' ability to organize themselves properly, the Imperial Court will pass judgment on the remnants of the demonic world. The case of Leviathan Lance was an accident, and the demonic forces are intent on overthrowing the Empire.

If you do not kill Owen de Getmora, the Empire will reserve judgment.

It would be unhelpful to leave a revolutionary faction with no chance of working with them, especially if their intentions were to rebuild the demonic world.

Keeping Owen alive could suggest that the group has ulterior motives, rather than just focusing on disrupting the Empire. However, it also raises the question of why they would want to work with the Revolutionaries in the first place.

"We can't let our enemies be convinced of who we are."

There is no reason for the Empire to know what we seek. The moment we decide to take Owen's life, the Imperials' attitude toward us is finalized.

Bertus is trying to use us. If the supposed enemy is willing to acknowledge our existence, there's no reason we can't convince them that we are the enemy.

"It's disgusting, but we'll let Owen de Getmora live. It can't hurt to have some sort of connection to the imperial family that the demonic forces can access."

"Yes, degradation."

Sarkegar nodded in understanding.

You can't take it personally and obsess over saving or killing someone's life.

The moment I thought about it, I realized that I was admitting that I had already become the kind of person who would casually put someone's life on a scale.

"What was your reaction?"

"He got a little angry when I told him I was going to borrow his name, but he never touched me."

In his office, Bertus watched Owen de Getmora sipping black tea on his couch.

"I didn't think he'd make it back alive, but I'm surprised."

"That's what I thought, Your Majesty."

Owen de Getmora.

A traitor, one of the cadres of the revolutionary forces. Now it would consume the headless revolutionary forces, and slowly, it would sweep them under the rug, swing them this way and that, and then sink them.

He may have been a traitor, but in the end, he too came back from a place where his life was in danger.

Owen de Getmora was the top contributor to this operation.

Despite Bertus's instructions, he manipulated the board, manipulated the correspondence, and maneuvered his words to bring everyone together.

In practice.

The idea of joining forces with the demonic forces was met with even more opposition from the leaders of the revolutionary forces.

But by shifting letters and words, Owen misled everyone into thinking that the majority of the leadership had already decided to work with the demonic forces.

Bertus had a lot on his mind.

What the hell do they want?

When Owen told me that he had been approached and told that he wanted to join hands, I wondered if it was to overthrow the empire.

But now that their plans have been derailed, when they should have been spitting in the face of a broken plate, so to speak, they have meekly backed down.

They join forces with revolutionary forces because they want to overthrow the empire.

Then I had to kill Owen. If it's a ruined plan, at least create some chaos.

But Owen de Getmora returned safely. Did he know that if Owen was killed, there was already a plan in place to absorb the next revolutionary force?

No, that's highly unlikely, Bertus assures him. If he knew Owen was a traitor, he would have had no reason to contact him in the first place.

"I don't know what the hell they want."

Chaos or stability. If it's stability, why on earth would you want your enemy to be stable.

Bertus had solved a big problem, but he felt like he had fallen into an even bigger quagmire.

"By the way, now tell me."

"What do you mean?"

At Bertus's words, Owen smiled wryly.

"Why did he betray me?"

Owen wasn't the spy Bertus had put in from the beginning. After the Rotary Club business, he came to me out of the blue and told me everything.

Owen squints and stares into his teacup.

"Zhang Shiqi had a dream."

"It's a dream......."

"Yes, it was a long time before I realized it was a dream that wasn't going to come true, but I knew it was a dream and I was going to wake up."

"I guess you were pretty serious about the revolution."

"or not."

He seriously dreamed of revolution. Owen nonchalantly states that he seriously denied it in front of the top beneficiaries of the caste system.

The old man had risked his life against the demons alone, so he was bound to be bold in his own way, even in front of Bertus.

An old merchant dreamed of a world where everyone was equal. Seriously.

"What can I say that's already gone, but they seemed to be intoxicated with themselves discussing what the revolution was rather than dreaming of the revolution itself, and even within that, the way they were divided and treated depending on whether they were from the Orbis class or not, and how far along they were in their internal logic of the revolution....... I realized something else."

"Something else?"

"Yeah, that's just the way humans are."

Human nature, that is, discrimination and distinction.

Owen realized that even those who dreamed of equality were internally dividing people based on where they came from.

"Even in that new world, people are going to be divided, they're going to try to be divided, and some of those divided people are going to be honored and special, and some of those divided people are going to be despised and looked down upon, and if that's human nature, if that doesn't make the divisions go away, if the markers of the divisions just change, then why do we need a new world?"

"The old businessman realized too late that if you can't get rid of distinctions, there's no reason to get rid of the stable distinctions that already exist, and there's no reason to bleed to death replacing distinctions with distinctions."

Bertus stared at Owen de Getmora as he spoke.

He dreamed of revolution, but after seeing what revolutionary organizations looked like for so long, he knew it would not eliminate discrimination and segregation, but only create new ones.

He decided that such a revolution was not worth the effort, so he sought out Bertus.

Instead of replacing the pyramid, you met the person who is now at the top of the pyramid.

Bertus looked at Owen de Getmora and gave him a wicked grin.

"That's all well and good, but I wonder if it's just a vendetta or a sense of betrayal that comes from not being from the Orbis class and not being able to be a leader?"

I was loyal to the organization like a dog, but in the end, I didn't make it to the top, not because I couldn't be part of the Orbis class graduate clique.

Owen de Getmora chuckled at Bertus's malicious comment, not because he was bitter about having to settle for being an officer.

"Hehe, is that all there is to it? Partly because I'm a lowly money-grubber, and partly because I'm not a noble. Your Grace."

"Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha. Ha, ha!"

Bertus couldn't help but chuckle at Owen de Getmora's bad joke.

Owen's inability to become the leader of a revolutionary organization speaks for itself about how contradictory it was.

Bertus laughed for a long time, then wiped a handkerchief across his eyes.

"Okay, thanks for this one, but I'll call you later if I need you."

"Call me anytime, Your Highness."

Bertus watches as Owen nods and walks away.

I had a dream, and I knew it was a bad dream.

Thus, Owen de Getmora, who pushed all those who dreamed with him into the pits of hell, was either betrayed or determined.

Owen de Getmora had a dangerous dream, but he abandoned it earlier than most, and gained immunity in exchange for selling out those he once dreamed with.

Bertus doesn't care about that.

He watched the old merchant's back, not so much stretched as stretched.
