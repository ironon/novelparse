            Episode 403.





I was only away from the Temple for two days, and my return was at night. I was long past my bedtime.

So you know where I've been, but no one knows yet that I've returned from an encounter with the Death Knights in Razierne. Of course, an event being an event, rumors will soon begin to circulate in the Zodiac.

"......."

After parting ways with Olivia, I returned to my sophomore dorm to find Ellen sitting in the lobby in a daze.

I thought this might be the case.

Ellen looks at me.

"......."

I could see so many emotions in his eyes. He was sitting there, worried about me, wondering when I was going to come back, but when he saw me, he didn't know how to start talking.

Rather, he avoids eye contact and ducks his head.

I felt like my chest was being squeezed shut.

Are we just going to be like everyone else?

If that's the case, that's probably a good thing.

Shouldn't we be glad that we're in this situation to relieve each other of some of the emotional baggage?

You should.

It'll be less hard on each other later.

But I couldn't get comfortable. No matter what I said, it was deceptive. Because you can't choose everything, and I chose something.

I chose Charlotte.

Stay away from Ellen Artorius.

Just like that.

I'm trying to get past it.

-cook

Ellen, grabbing the hem of my shirt as I tried to pass.

"......."

"......."

I couldn't tell him to let go.

It's not like I'm holding on for dear life.

I don't know what to say, but I can't let it go.

He was only holding on very weakly, as if the slightest twist of his arm would cause him to let go.

It wasn't that long ago that I was hugging them so hard that they wouldn't let go.

Our relationship was destroyed by the word engagement.

So it's not a hand, it's a hem, and a very weak one at that.

Ellen seemed to think it was wrong for me to even do that.

"Dangerous place. Been there."

Ellen says, keeping her head down.

"......."

"I can smell something burning....... after."

You've been to a place that's been on fire, and your clothes are burnt.

Not knowing what to say, I felt like she could only guess where I'd been and what I'd been through from that.

I'm Ellen, who has a terrible aversion to putting myself in dangerous situations.

I hate it, but there's no stopping me from doing what I've decided to do. But this time, the danger was in a place that wasn't dangerous.

I couldn't uproot Ellen, and she couldn't pull me down.

"Keep going like this....... Dangerous place....... like this......?"

Ellen looks up at me, tears welling in her eyes.

I'm sure Ellen knows what I need to do.

"Maybe."

"......."

"It's okay, I'm not going anywhere really dangerous, and even if I wanted to go, people wouldn't let me."

That's a lie.

Even in a less dangerous place, something as sudden as this could happen. Knowing that my followers are happening in places I can't control, I can't necessarily assume that everywhere I go, even this ecliptic, is safe.

I could feel Ellen's eyes on me, and I could tell she didn't believe me at all.

Word of the Demon Cultists' assault on the Levainan capital of Raziern will soon reach the ecliptic. It will also be rumored that Olivia and I were there, and that I had an encounter with a Death Knight.

Ellen opened her mouth as if to say something, but eventually dropped her head again.

The hand that grabbed my sleeve finally let go.



* * *



I'm back in my room in the dorm.

I couldn't stop thinking about it.

After washing up and just before getting into bed, there was a movement in the air.

-Snarl

From one side of the room, a white mist congeals and takes the shape of a human.

"So how was it?"

"Ah, my lord."

It was Lucinil, the silver-haired girl.

Lucinil is not the same as Sarkegar in the sense that he can sneak up on anyone. Lucinil acted as my bodyguard, but even that had its limitations, and he couldn't keep up with Raziern.

"I've heard it's not that dangerous, but......."

Whether it was from EpinHauser, Lucinil didn't seem too worried.

"Your expression says otherwise."

Of course, my frown right now has more to do with what I just ran into with Ellen than what happened in Raziern.

"The cultists have attacked Raziern."

"......what?"

Lucinil's expression hardened at my words.

Lucinil knows why I went to Raziern, so I'll only explain what happened afterward.

That the crowds in Raziern had gone mad with demonic fear and began to lynch and execute heretics, and that suddenly, real demonists were attacking Raziern.

Then there's the story of his encounter with the Death Knights and his escape from Raziern when things seemed to be getting worse.

The big question is this.

"I think they're following me."

"......What the hell is that?"

I know. It's so bizarre, it's hard to understand. I'm just as confused and pissed off.

"They were acting like I made them do it, like they were raiding Raziern, and they were calling me some kind of prophet or something."

"......You didn't do the Lazier thing in the first place."

"That's right."

I made a short tongue-in-cheek comment.

"They think I must have had a reason to destroy Raziern, and that's why they attacked it, hoping to complete the job I failed to do......."

I didn't actually lead the attack on Raziern, so what the cultists are doing is just a bunch of bullshit. It has nothing to do with my will, except for the deaths of countless people.

"An entire city has been burned to the ground by the over-loyalty of men they don't even know......."

Lucinil crosses her arms and sighs.

"What the hell are you doing?"

Lucinil was skeptical about the idea of world peace, but the demonic raids in Bertus's plot were also backing me into a corner.

I had some idea that the demonic religion, which was supposed to have died out with the return of the Devil, was growing in power somewhere, but it was eerie to see it in person.

"First, we need to find the Satanists and either put them under us or wipe them out."

Now that I've confirmed their loyalty to me, I need to find them and turn them into real subordinates, or destroy them if their ideas are too dangerous.

We need to find the cultists.

Lucinil shook her head at my comment.

"But how are we going to find it?"

"I'll have to think about that."

They wouldn't be out in the open in the first place, so there wasn't much we could do to catch them unless they were out in the open.

"Well, I'll share it with Council and Order for now."

"Yes, sir. And I'll try to get in touch with the imperial family, too, because I think they'll understand, but I think they need to be made aware that this isn't something we did."

"Well, yeah. I'd better make sure I'm clear."

He would make contact through Sarkeghar, but it would be good to talk to the imperial court as well.

A situation where trying to forge ties with the revolutionary forces has actually created a link with their arch-enemy, the imperial family.

The Empire expects us to be enemies at some point, but until they can take advantage of us, they will. Just as I am now.

It would be up to Rusinil to communicate his thoughts to Sarkegar.

"I know it was unavoidable, but don't do anything too risky. This is what it's like to leave your kid in the water."

I can't believe you're treating me like a child, like I'm a drowning child. Of course, I appreciate that you're worried about me, after all, but I can't help but imagine Lucinil biting her nails and freaking out at the news that I've gone to Raziern, and I think that's kind of cute, too.

"I might sneak up on you later, so don't be too surprised if I show up out of the blue."

"Well, that's great for me, but if anyone sees that, you know I'm not allowed to have a room in the temple, right?"

"That's for you to figure out, kid. Anyway, let's go back to......."

"Oh, right."

As it looked like Lucinil was about to leave, I thought of one last thing to say.

"That....... isn't any more important than demonology."

"What is it?"

"I think there's an emerging religion going on."

This is ridiculous now that I say it.

"Emerging religions? What kind of bullshit is that?"

"A religion is spreading among the people that believes in the resurrection of Lagan Artorius."

"Uh....... What?"

As stunned as I was. Lucinil's reaction was no different. Some people go crazy with fear and suspect their neighbors of being infidels, others go crazy with fear and look for ridiculous hope.

The cause is the same - fear - but the effect is very different.

"Wow....... I've seen a lot of bizarre things people do, but this is just out of this world......."

The current state of affairs, with the vain belief that a dead warrior will be resurrected because the demon has no opponent, seemed absurd to Lucinil.

"I'm sure that belief will dissipate once the actual owner of the relic is revealed to the world, but that's only because I have no reason to believe it right now......."

After all, by believing in the resurrection of the warrior, we believe that the devil will be defeated. I wonder if the belief in the resurrection of the warriors will naturally disappear when it is known that the devil's arch-enemy, not the warriors, has appeared in the world.

At my words, Lucinil stares at me.

"Is that....... Reinhardt, because I don't think that's the picture?"

"Yes?"

"I thought you said you were engaged to be married to a princess, and you were going to tell her you were the master of Alsbringer?"

"Yes."

What's the point of that?

"And the Alsbringer is the sword of Ragan Artorius, right?"

"Yes what......."

"Wouldn't that make people believe you were the reincarnation of Lagan Artorius?"

"?"

No, I don't know what that means.

"No, even if Ragan Artorius was really reincarnated, he'd be less than a year old now, and he's been dead for a little over a year. It's out of time for me to believe that I'm the reincarnation of Ragan Artorius, because that doesn't make sense......."

"Does it even make sense to believe in the resurrection of Lagan Artorius in the first place?"

"Ah."

The words made my head spin.

Right.

If people who believe in nonsense in the first place can't believe in more nonsense, what can they believe in?

If it became known that I was the owner of the Alsbringer, it was certain that the followers of Mercenaryism would treat me as the reincarnation of Artorius, or as a prophet, simply because I had the Alsbringer.

"Wow, our Bali is great, he's a prophet of the demon religion and a prophet of the warrior religion!"

Lucinil let out an evil laugh and pulled me into a hug.

-Wrong!

"Holy shit......."

"My baby is the best!"

"Why am I your kid!"

I roughly pull Lucinil away, and she smiles a wicked grin, hmmm, and contemplates.

"Wow, you're not kidding, you really do have a lot of titles, don't you?"

"The last rightful heir to the Darklands."

"King of all demons."

"Allies of the Vampire Council."

"Collaborator of the Black Order."

"Master of Tiamata and Apostle of Tuan."

"Master of Alsbringer and Apostle of Als."

"The prophet of all satanists."

"There is a prophet of the Mercenary Order, and......."

Lucinil chuckles.

"And the sire of the Imperial family of the Gradual Empire?"

I'm getting dizzy listening to this.

"Isn't this a contradiction in terms?"

So.......

What the hell am I.......

What is it?



* * *



As Lucinil says, it's a given that the followers of the Mercenary religion would worship me as a prophet if they knew of my existence.

And the Demon Cultists claim to be the servants of the Devil.

Two prophets with two very different attributes.

We decided to leave the search for the cultists to the council. They would want to contact the Demon, and if we could get through to them, we would have them in our hands. The problem was, we didn't know which way to go.

The next day.

Olivia and I got a call from Saviolin Tana.

"It turned out to be the Satanists who appeared in Raziern."

"......."

"After all......."

"At this point, we believe that the powers of the demons Kier and Talad were used."

Kier, God of Corruption, and Talad, God of Intimidation.

Demon priests, the opposite of Tuan and the opposite of the sun god, were brought in, which would mean that the demigods were working together like the Five Great Houses.

I thought they were using some sort of magic, but it was holy magic, the holy power of a demon.

"What's the situation?"

Tana's expression darkened at Olivia's question.

"It was all about dealing with the rising corpses. We managed to capture a few of the cultists, but they all committed suicide, and the point is....... We're tracking them, but we don't know what the outcome will be."

Saviolin Tana said it, but she seemed to think the trace would fail.

And Tana's expression was dark with guilt as she said it.

Shanapelle and the imperial court will know that the cultists have no direct contact with the devil.

Because it doesn't make sense that the Demons would come to finish the job on Raziern, which wasn't a Demon Raid in the first place.

The Empire's self-inflicted wounds had drawn too much attention. The damage done to Raziern by the Empire's self-inflicted wounds, and the misunderstandings of the demons there and elsewhere, was not pretty.

Saviolin Tana must be feeling a lot of responsibility right now.

There's been a demonic attack, and the dead can't be brought back.

So it's clear that he believes that the cultists responsible for this must be found and destroyed.

Saviolin Tana looks at Olivia this time.

Because Scotra Kelton clearly saw Olivia holding a tiara that was clearly mine.

"Me and Olivia are sharing a Tiamata."

It was me, not Olivia, who answered.

"Share......?"

Naturally, I was baffled because I had no idea such a concept was possible.

"Didn't I tell you last time, Tiamata was corrupted, and you purified the sword......."

"Yes, I did."

As I fought Charlotte, who had been possessed by a demonic spirit, I retrieved the Tiamata, and I told the story of Olivia, explaining how it was acquired. Olivia purified the corrupted Tiamata, and I became its owner.

He didn't mention that he shared Tiamata with Olivia.

"Since then, he and I have been able to use Tiamata together."

"Is it possible that....... possible......."

But even if it's not supposed to happen, it did happen.

"Yes, I completely understand that you wanted to keep it a secret. If you want me to keep this a secret, I can certainly do that. But you know there's nothing I can do about the rumors spreading from those who saw you two in Raziern."

"No."

At Tana's suggestion, Olivia shook her head.

"I'm thinking about going back to teaching."

Knowing that fame would kill her, Olivia decided to make herself more famous.

Saviolin Tana's eyes widened when she heard Olivia's decision.
