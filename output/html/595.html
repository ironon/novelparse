You never know where the four of you are going to land.

It's clear that a nasty group of people are involved.

But when you add politics to the mix, it's even worse.

If you're trying to investigate a case involving undeadization and you end up meddling with the Crusaders, things can get complicated in a whole new way.

"By the way. I was wondering about......."

As Ellen and Louise deliberated, Heinrich spoke up with a question.

"What is it?"

"Are the ashes really undead?"

Louise nodded slowly at Heinrich's question.

"Nothing we could see. The paladins didn't seem too sure about that either."

The possibility that the remains are undead, which is also a guess based on the destruction of the coffin, but not technically a confirmation of undead.

It's just that it most likely did.

At Heinrich's question, Ellen, Ludwig, and Louise turn to look at him.

Heinrich began to sweat at the attention.

"I wondered if it was that easy to create an undead......."

"Um......?"

The words made Louise shake her head.

"Isn't it said that those buried in cemeteries are saints?"

"Yes, and the remains of those who accomplished so much in their lifetimes were buried there."

"The grave of a former Crusader Knight Commander was also there."

Louise and Ellen answered. Heinrich listened, his face serious, his lips pursed as if he were choosing his words.

"I don't understand how the ashes become undead in the first place....... I don't quite understand......."

You have become undead.

The reasoning itself is reasonable, but Heinrich was thinking about something more fundamental.

They were the remains of priests and paladins who must have accomplished great things in their lives, and whose divine powers must have been powerful in their lifetimes.

Is it possible for them to become undead and come back to life in the first place?

"Well....... I don't know much about evil arcana or black magic, such as the undead, and I'm sure it's a field unknown even to mages who walk the path of righteousness, so I'm not sure if the divine power the lion had in life would protect their remains after death."

"I don't know."

Not just any undead, but undead made from the remains of saints, if that's possible.

Is it even possible to create that many undead in a short amount of time?

Ellen's mind keeps going back to Tiamata.

Tiamata once manifested in the form of a cursed magic sword, and spawned undead on a massive scale.

'No....... No, not Reinhardt.......'

Ellen was pretty sure Reinhardt wasn't the culprit, given the circumstances.

In the end, Heinrich's question is this.

Whether it makes sense to create undead from the remains of saints in the first place.

"Let's ask."

Surprisingly, the answer came from Ludwig's mouth.

"If not me, at least you know better than we do."

A mage with a talent for the dark arts.

Anna De Guerna.

At that, Ellen and Heinrich nodded.



* * *



There is no guarantee that black magic was used in the theft of the saints' tombs. It's entirely possible that priests of a non-magical religion were involved.

They are two different forces.

However, there may be a point of agreement in that they end up producing similar results.

Ludwig's suggestion to find Anna and ask her questions was worth a try, since it's unlikely that they'd be able to find the demonic priest now.

"He won't be in the dorm, because he comes back every few days and leaves the next day and doesn't come back for another few days."

"Where is he? Let's go ask him."

She figured she'd just have to go to the temple and ask.

"Huh? I don't know about that......."

Naturally, Ludwig didn't know where the three of them were studying magic.

Naturally, Louise and Heinrich's eyes met.

"University of Magic."

Earlier this morning, they were strolling through the temple when they realized that something was going on at the School of Magic.

"I'm not sure, but I think it's probably in there."

Heinrich said, and Louise narrowed her eyes.

"I don't know if they'll let me in......."

Seeing the heavy security, Ruiz seemed nervous.

But now they're with Ellen Artorius, who can see through anything in the world.

So there wasn't really anything I couldn't fit in there.



* * *



Of course, that was an illusion.

"You are not allowed to enter."

Those were the words of the guard who blocked Ellen's path as she entered the grounds of the Temple School of Magic's research wing.

The people behind her weren't trying to get in, and she heard it herself when she tried.

"...... Why?"

"There was an order from His Majesty the Emperor not to allow anyone other than those involved in the research to enter."

When we say don't let anyone in because they're blocking her way, we're including Ellen.

Ellen stays still and looks into the eyes of the guard in the helmet.

What kind of super secret research is he doing that he can't even let himself in?

If it was a Crusader door, Ellen would have gotten through it.

But it was important that it was an order from the 'emperor'.

Emperor Bertus is someone who is in Ellen's circle of friends.

A friend who shares a secret that no one else should know, and who shares the blame for the Gate debacle.

A relationship in which you share the residue of guilt and grief, but can't express it in words other than friendship.

If he's banning you, there's got to be a reason.

Ellen accepts that.

"You don't have to go in there, I just need to know that there's a classmate of mine in that lab named Anna de Guerna who's working on a study, and if you could call her in if you can."

"I can't tell you anything about the research."

Even who is participating in the research is classified. I couldn't imagine what they were doing and why they were so security conscious.

"But I can report to the higher-ups that you're here for this."

Ellen wasn't really curious about what they were doing inside anyway.

I can only assume that they're working on something that could be used to help the war effort, and that's why they're so careful to keep it confidential.

She wasn't going to begrudge it, and she wasn't going to pry.

The research that happens here has nothing to do with what's happening now.

"That's great, can you tell them that?"

"Yes, I see."

Anna might be here, but if she isn't, you'll just have to wait until she returns to the Royal Class Dormitory.

She comes back every few days.



* * *



Told by the guards to stay back because they couldn't report right away, the group eventually returned to the Temple dormitory.

For some reason, the Emperor has ordered that no one else, not even Ellen, is allowed in the College of Magic.

Royal Class sophomore, Class B dorm lobby.

We all sat around and sipped the tea Heinrich had brought and caught our breath.

I've been out in the snow so far, so I'm not physically exhausted, but I'm mentally exhausted.

"Whatever it is, it must be a highly confidential experiment."

"Sure."

At Louise's words, Ellen nodded in agreement.

Everyone in the room was curious about the research going on at the College of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but not much more than that.

It's a preconceived notion.

"In retrospect, it was odd that the Titan project was not classified, and I've heard that the Mages' Guild and the Mages of the Tower have been annoying Archduke Saint-Thuan quite a bit."

"What do you mean, bother?"

At Ellen's question, Louise shrugged.

"Wizards are the kind of people who can't stand the sight of any new magic or technology, and for those of us who have spent our lives in magic, the Titans....... is bound to shock them, isn't it?"

"Definitely......."

"Yes....... I did, apparently."

Heinrich and Ludwig also felt a shiver run down their spines as they imagined the Titan's overwhelming majesty, even when it wasn't in front of them.

At the Battle of Serandia, the Titans were so massive and overwhelming that they could be seen from anywhere on the battlefield.

"I mean, they're being made, and the higher-ups and wizards usually know about it, but to see it with your own eyes is something else. When I saw it, it seemed absurd that magic could do such a thing."

The Titan was a magical weapon of war, but in its presence, everyone could not help but feel as if they had seen an incarnation or manifestation of the gods.

"So it's no wonder that the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan, who was the mastermind behind the project, is being hounded by wizards, and....... Archduke."

Adelia in Class A.

The Archduke is the Archduke, and Adelia is a student from the Royal Class.

Heinrich mumbles to himself.

"Adelia must be going through a lot."

"That's just the way it is."

The Titan Project isn't exactly secret, but not all of its technology is, so it's inevitable that the wizards will bother the Archduke and Adelia, whether out of curiosity or because they covet the knowledge.

Wizards swarming around like dogs, asking questions, and Adelia, by nature, not being able to fend them off.

As Heinrich contemplated the scene, he couldn't help but be deeply concerned about Adelia's mental state.

Adelia is a celestial researcher. Hand-to-hand combat is not in her nature and she is not very good at it.

Of course, Adelia didn't fight, but she will always be remembered as the wizard who killed the most monsters in the world because of her creation of the Titan.

Magical research is usually confidential.

In this case, everyone didn't think much of it because of the preconceived notion that it was just another case. Of course, everyone was puzzled by the fact that even Ellen was not allowed to enter the research building.

"When will Anna be back?"

Ludwig's question left everyone unsure.

In the end, the guard wouldn't tell me if Anna was at Hogwarts or not. All he would say was that Ellen had come to see him.

Asking Anna about the black magic of undeadization doesn't give us a straight answer to this situation. You're asking her if it's easy to create undead from the remains of saints.

At the end of the day, it's not like I'm nervous or anything, but it's also not like I'm in a rush to get it done.

We could ask the Five Patriarchs for an interview, but that's too sensitive and we'll have to think about it a bit more.

If you're going to search a refugee camp for satanists, that's a long shot.

Rowen was not acting alone; he probably had numerous inquisitors scattered throughout the refugee camps, synthesizing information.

We don't know if Rowen ever reached the perpetrators.

It's on the heels of the case Rowen was chasing, and there are even fewer people available.

I don't even know if I'll be able to get to the end of this before winter is over.

So there's no point in rushing to do it today.

"Let's call it a day."

So, Ellen suggested that we take a break today to wrap up what we've learned.

"Ludwig, you can ask Anna what we were going to ask her when she gets back and let us know....... No, just call me."

Ellen corrected herself, realizing that it was better to ask the question herself than to leave it to Ludwig.

"Yeah, okay."

Ludwig nodded, his expression grim.

"I don't think we need to move too fast. Even if we don't know who killed Rowen, if they know we're after them, they'll be able to......."

Louise looks at everyone with a stern look on her face.

"We have to keep in mind that there's a chance they're going to try to get their hands on us."

These are the men who killed Rowen.

We don't know if they'll go after the warriors, but we can't say they won't do the same thing to Rowen if they know they're already being tracked.

Neither Heinrich, nor Ludwig, nor Ellen.

I didn't realize it was a significant risk to pursue.

"I think I've gotten myself into trouble......."

I didn't think this was a simple task.

But when he turns to Ellen for help, Ludwig can't help but think that this is a big deal.

The thought of Ellen being in danger because of him sent chills down Ludwig's spine.

Also, I feel like I'm causing irreparable harm.

"No."

Ellen shook her head at Ludwig's self-pity.

"At this point, I don't think I can let this go."

Rather, Ellen adds, it's better for people if whatever is happening can be addressed before it gets out of hand.

I don't say this to console you.

I only said that because I really thought so.
