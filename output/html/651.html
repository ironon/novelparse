A message from Kliffman, or more accurately, a request.

That you want to meet Riana.

It's not up to me or Charlotte to decide in the first place.

Of course, I could have told him to go see her, but I didn't want to do that.

Does Cliff have the right to say he wants to see Riana?

Cliff wasn't the only one who said he'd take our side if we let him meet Riana.

Even if he is on our side, does Cliff's power mean much to us at this point?

Klippmann has definitely gotten stronger and has raised his major.

But in a world of master classes and archmages, Cliff's power won't mean much.

It can't be a variable like conolint.

You can think of things like that.

However, we decided not to consider them.

I didn't even want to think about it.

Relationships matter.

Maybe the most important thing in the world.

I think so.

Because the world is the way it is because of that relationship, because of that emotion.

If I weren't the demon Valerie.

If Ellen wasn't Lagan Artorius's sister.

If Charlotte wasn't the Emperor's daughter.

It's all about getting to know them without properly addressing those issues.

These issues should not be treated lightly.

So in the end, it's not really my call.

It's up to you to decide.



* * *



"Me......?"

When Riana heard Cliffman's message, she had an indescribably strange look on her face.

Riana's dilated pupils told the story of how surprised he was.

At Temple, Cliffman was a man without numbers.

No, that wasn't enough.

He had no idea how to treat women or men, and after countless encounters on the dance floor, he hadn't spoken the first word until months later.

Worse for the girls, if Ellen or Harriet tried to talk to them, they would flounder and sink into themselves.

He had a day's worth of socialization, so to speak, and his bowl was the size of a soy sauce paper.

When I was playing against someone, I would get lost in my own thoughts and get picked off.

Riana, on the other hand, was completely unassuming.

It looks very cranky on the outside, but it's actually very fluffy and I don't care what anyone says, I don't take it to heart.

She's always been very proactive about anything and everything, so once I've gotten to know the kids, it's always been Riana who says let's go somewhere.

The guy who overshadows everyone.

He's not afraid of anyone.

They're opposites, but I've found that people with completely different personalities work better together than people with similar personalities.

In fact, Riana had always seen only a passive Cliff and had been dragging him around for some time.

I was the one who decided to put Cliff in Mr. Temple, but Rianna was the one who really helped with that.

Eventually, they became friends.

When Duke Granz died, he vowed revenge on me.

But Riana came to my rescue on the day of the Gate Crisis, without telling Klippmann.

Without telling me the true cause of my father's death, or that he had decided to rescue me.

I guess you could call it a betrayal.

However, while the Temple days were years ago in time, they feel like decades ago in sensory terms.

Everything has changed.

Riana has changed, and so has Clifford.

Kliffman, who had always been a passive person and had difficulty interacting with people, demanded to meet Riana.

And.

She was always proactive, bold, and acted like she didn't even know words like stranger.

"......."

Riana was blue in the face and shaking.



* * *



Is Riana's behavior a betrayal?

Riana would not have wanted to take Cliff alone on a dangerous road.

Truly, I was no force then. It was madness to follow me, even to try to save me while I was held captive by the Empire.

Herriot was the only one who agreed to join her in the action.

Riana didn't realize that the road vampires were trying to save her.

It's a crazy thing to do, and Riana would have died that day.

So I wouldn't have been able to tell Kliffman that.

In effect, I couldn't take Cliff with me on my way to die.

But even if there is no betrayal, there can be a sense of betrayal. I don't know what Kliffman thinks of Riana's behavior.

Of course, Riana wouldn't know.

Kliffman said he wanted to meet Riana, but he didn't say what he thought of her.

I don't even know what Kliffman thinks of me.

Like Christina or Ludwig, you might want to hold me accountable.

I've been through too much to imagine that it will ever be the same as it was at Temple.

Neither Riana nor I know what Cliff is trying to accomplish by asking us to meet, or what he has in mind.

That's why Riana is blue in the face and shaking.

You never know what you'll be told, and you never know when you'll be attacked.

So much has changed that Riana is not the same Riana, and Cliff is not the same Cliff.

That's the scary part.

It's not because it's dangerous to meet.

It's important to see and hear how things have changed, because the moment you see it can be terrifying.

It was not for me or Charlotte to judge this message.

At the very least, you should let her know.

"You don't have to force yourself to meet."

"......."

On balance, it's better not to meet.

Whether Cliff is on our side or not, it doesn't really matter to the mainstream.

But Riana is one of the most important people on our side.

In the unlikely event that he does, Cliff is the only one who could hurt Riana. So it's better not to meet.

The potential gains are very small, and the potential losses are enormous.

Tapping away at the calculator, this encounter can't even be considered.

I can bounce an abacus, but I'm not going to let the results of that abacus influence my decisions.

There's only one thing that matters.

Does Riana want to meet, or not.

I'm sure Riana can do the math without me telling her.

If you don't want to meet, you don't have to. Whatever the reason.

The decision is left to Riana.

Just as the outcomes and realities of this world are not the result of a P&L.

In the end, it's not about gains and losses.

Riana was terrified.

It's weird.

In her Temple days, Riana was clearly a psychic with immense potential. But her powers weren't as strong then.

But Riana has always been confident and assertive.

What is Riana like now.

It's no exaggeration to say that he's the world's greatest superhero.

Riana's power is now beyond the reach of any mage, let alone a psychic.

Now stronger than anyone else, Riana's personality is the opposite.

Easily depressed, overwhelmed, and distressed.

It became passive.

She's terrified of what she'll hear when Cliffman asks to meet with her.

Riana is as weak as she is strong.

Riana says.

"It's ......."

"Uh."

Riana's eyes were fluttering.

"Me, I'm so scared......."

We haven't even met yet.

I don't even know what Kliffman is thinking.

But Riana's eyes were bright red.

"I'm scared....... I think I'm going to die......."

There's only one reason for such a strong reaction.

It's because Riana cares about Cliff, and only Cliff.

Your loved ones will never treat you the same way again.

I'm so scared of that.

I'd even go so far as to say it's killing me.

Yes.

It's probably similar to how I hate and dread the moment I see a different Ellen.

Riana hung her head and shuddered for a long time.

Over the years, I've had my fair share of anxiety attacks.

But it was the first time I'd ever seen him this weak.

"Still....... right?"

I think it's because she realizes that, as a human being, Liana de Granz, she shouldn't turn it down.

"We don't have to meet."

Do we have to meet?

I'm not sure about that.

He may come back from the encounter wounded, either physically or emotionally, or he may not.

"Well, let's think about that later."

"Later?"

"Okay. I don't know what happened, but let's just say we'll think about it later."

We don't know what the future holds.

But right now, we're in a position where we can make a decision that only Cliff can make.

Later.

"If you decide not to meet now, do you think you'll regret it later, or do you think you won't?"

I don't know if I'll ever get a chance to meet Cliffman again.

But if I take this opportunity to say, I'm not going to meet you.

If you give that answer to Kliffman, or ignore it altogether.

What happens.

What will Kliffman think, and what will Riana regret later?

Put aside the authoritarianism of whether you should or shouldn't meet.

I only think about regrets.

Whether you'll regret it or not if you don't meet.

"Right now, I'm scared to death and....... But......."

Riana looks up.

"If we decide not to meet now, I'll send you an email to......."

Tears eventually fall from the reddened eyes.

"I think I'll feel like this for the rest of my life......."

We don't know if this is an opportunity or a crisis.

However.

If you don't meet him, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

Riana seemed to think so.



* * *



Is there such a thing as something you must face, even if it's scary?

Is it okay to run, evade, or ignore?

But there are such things in the world.

Something you'll surely regret later.

Things you avoid because you're afraid now, you'll surely regret later.

It's scary, but there are things you need to do to avoid regretting it later.

For Liana de Granz, it was this.

"I can come with you.

At Reinhardt's words, Riana shook her head.

'It's not....... I think meeting alone....... seems right.'

Not wanting to give any indication of what might happen, Riana chose to face it alone.

You need someone to help you get there and back, but in the moment, you need to be alone.

It would be the least she could do, if not atone for leaving without saying a word. Riana thought.

In the first place, there's no reason for Klippmann's demand to be granted.

Heinrich relayed the words to Louise.

Louise heard the outlandish requirement.

And Rowen, who passed the message along.

Charlotte and Reinhardt too.

The same goes for Riana.

And.

Also, Kliffman, who actually said it.

I wouldn't have thought that could be possible.

But in each person's judgment, the message traveled beyond the person, and in Riana's own judgment, upon hearing the request, the meeting was arranged.

The world has changed, times have changed, and people have changed.

We used to be able to walk down the dorm hall and knock on the door, but so much has changed that you have to go through a lot of people to get what you want to say.

Let's see.

You have to go through a lot of people for that one word.

It became too hard to get the words out.

That's how the meeting happened.

In a wooded area, you can't go far beyond a clearing that's empty except for the strewn corpses of slain monsters.

Indeed, it's been a long time coming.

But in the nature of the times, where you can't help but feel more time has passed than you can see, psychologically it feels like decades have passed.

Cliffman was able to have the meeting he wanted on a stump there.

"......."

There was a face there that only Cliff wanted.

Always confident, sometimes overbearing.

The one who used to grab Cliffman's arm and drag him somewhere, always confidently whisking the boy along with her, telling him to trust her and follow her.

His hands were now clasped together, his eyes downcast.

As if they don't deserve eye contact.

Like someone who has committed such a great sin that they can't even look the other person in the eye.

"......Hello."

Even the words, as I struggled to get them out, were barely audible.

Just like that.

"It's been a while......"

Klippmann could see Liana de Granz, who had shrunk to the point where she couldn't get any smaller.
