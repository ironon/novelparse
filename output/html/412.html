            Episode 412





As soon as I stepped out of my room for my early morning workout, I saw him and briefly debated whether or not to speak to him.

Two outsiders who seem to have come in with serious problems.

When I heard the word "murder," I acted before I thought.

"I need to interview a key informant in a murder case at the Imperial Ministry of Magic. I've already secured Temple's cooperation."

Harriet looks back and forth between me and the investigators.

There's no way Herriot would have done something like murder.

"Do you mind if I stay with you?"

It was clear that Herriot had gotten himself into trouble.



* * *



The Ministry of Magic investigators must have known me.

I offered to act as a chaperone and she agreed to accompany me, even though it was a very important case.

Fortunately, the investigation was not conducted outside the temple, but inside the Royal Class dormitory, in one of the unoccupied on-call rooms.

Herriot had no idea what was happening to him, and neither did I, who had suddenly been thrust into the situation.

Herriot was at the Imperial Ministry of Magic until late last night.

There was a bit of fear yesterday, but he said it was self-delusion.

What was going on after all?

"What....... happening?"

Harriet asked, her lips quivering slightly, and one of the investigators slowly began to explain.

"Last night, three officers were murdered and a spellbook was stolen from the Imperial Ministry of Magic's research library."

Murder, spellbook theft.

At that, Herriot's complexion began to turn from white to blue.

"The most likely suspect at this time is Dwin, the Eighth Research Reading Room officer who is currently out of contact."

"He, he....... Him?"

"Yes, DeWynn, as the person in charge of Reading Room 8, he is believed to be the mastermind of the incident."

as Dwin.

I had never heard of it before.

Herriot was horrified, but then he nodded dazedly, as if he understood.

Slowly, Herriot explained what happened yesterday.

The prime suspect is Lothar Dwin, who has now gone missing since committing the crime.

"I didn't see anything out of the ordinary....... I've been looking at some research material on warp gates....... Oh, come to think of it......."

Herriot hesitated for a moment, then spoke up.

"You said you got the spellbooks from somewhere....... Were they stolen?"

"Yes."

"Strangely, it seemed to be gibberish, and I wondered where it came from....... It was weird, it sounded like he was gibbering......."

"Are you saying that Dwin was a little different than usual?"

"Yeah....... He was always there and not there, but when I needed something, he had it ready for me....... He said something that day, and he wished he'd met me earlier....... Ah."

Herriot mumbled in a daze, as if realizing something.

Herriot told investigators a few more stories, but none of them led to anything significant.

Herriot, however, seemed devastated.

The person you were casually chatting with yesterday has committed murder and fled the palace.

"Thank you for your cooperation in the investigation."

After a brief discussion, the investigators stood up and left, apparently with no further business.

"Is that person....... can you catch him?"

In response to Herriot's fearful questions, investigators would neither confirm nor deny.

"We'll just have to hope for the best."

"Goodbye, then. Thank you for your cooperation. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Reinhardt."

"What? Ah....... Yes."

They thanked Harriet, said it was an honor to meet me, and left the on-call room with some pretty awkward quadruple entendres.

Random murders and thefts.

"......."

Her knuckles were still white from the shock.

Unable to sit still, I brewed some black tea from the on-call room and poured Harriet a cup.

"Oh, yeah....... Thanks. Reinhard."

She sipped her tea carefully, trembling, and when she finally finished, she took a deep breath.

"What the hell is going on......."

Herriot had obviously gone through something strange yesterday.

"That's the guy from yesterday, right?"

"Yes......."

A wizard who had suddenly stolen quite a few spellbooks. Herriot took a deep breath to calm himself.

"I don't know why they stole it, but....... That's a lot of money."

Was it enough to make an elite mage go blind, kill people, and run for his life?

"I thought he was greedy for a spellbook, but he killed a man......."

whoever Dwyn was, he was probably a mage who had been quite helpful to Herriot up to this point. Hearing that he had killed three people she was familiar with, if not close to, was bound to shock her.

Herriot murmurs through narrowed lips.

"I should have been more....... I should have realized that sooner......."

His decision to steal the grimoire had caused him to behave differently than usual. Herriot thought that if he had realized her intentions sooner, none of this would have happened.

"There's no way you could know that."

"Yes, but......."

I wonder if I'm beating myself up.

People might not have died if they had realized quickly that yesterday's Lothar Dwyn wasn't his usual self?

It's impossible to deduce that from his behavior. So Herriot's self-pity is meaningless.

Herriot hangs his head and fiddles with his teacup.

"It's just stupid, if I had realized it was weird, I could have told someone, even if I couldn't do anything about it, because I got scared shitless and ran away......."

Finally, he let out a deep sigh.

"Get yourself a....... pathetic."

I don't think it's Herriot's fault, and I don't think she thinks it's her fault.

However, I regretted my behavior yesterday when I ran away.

The choice to run away without bothering to find out how weird he is.

What to do.

This isn't Herriot's fault, but it's hard to sit back and watch this happen.

It's also a very big deal because it's a murder inside the palace.

"......Want to figure it out on our own?"

"Are we......?"

"I can't expect anything great, but I can't expect to find out nothing, either, right?"

It can't hurt to try.

I have the power to interfere in almost every aspect of the empire in the name of the warrior, and Herriot has the brains.

Most of all, I wanted to do something for Herriot, who hadn't been able to do anything for me.

Of course, I'm not sure that tracking murders is really doing anything.

And this.

Somehow, with this flow.......

Saturday, morning.

Ellen would normally train on the weekends, but Reinhardt left the dorm with Harriet to run errands.

I don't know what happened yesterday, but I learned that Herriot and Reinhard are back to their old ways.

I was worried that Herriot and Reinhardt seemed to be drifting apart.

Herriot and Reinhardt talking and heading off somewhere, though not in the same way.

I wonder if Herriot is okay now.

Ellen watched them out the window as they left the Temple with mixed feelings, glad for the relief, but somehow unable to fully embrace it.

A good, but not great, feeling.

Feeling this way made Ellen feel guilty for Harriet, but she couldn't help it.

So I found myself getting a little more, well, intimate with Herriot when there were three of us. Even though it felt like it was getting harder and harder for her to handle.

Training is not possible without Reinhardt. Saviolin Tana leaves the temple on weekends to attend to Shanafel's work, so we can't rely on her help.

I wish it wasn't such a time-consuming chore.

As Ellen thought about it, she wondered how she would train on her own.

"Hey."

However, Charlotte came to visit you in your Class A dorm.

"I need to talk to you for a minute."

It's not a friendly relationship to say the least, but it's cider bound by an oath of loyalty.

"Yes."

That's why Ellen obediently followed Charlotte.



* * *



Charlotte led Ellen out of the dormitory.

Charlotte's expression hardened as she realized that he wasn't going to make it easy for her.

"I don't know you very well, but I think your mouth is a little heavy. What do you think?"

"I'm not sure."

"Okay, so you don't think about it at all."

Ellen has a heavy mouth, to the point where the words heavy and light are not even in her head. She's not only insensitive to rumors, she doesn't even have a concept of what's going on.

Charlotte takes a few deep breaths.

A secret few people knew, and Charlotte was about to tell her unchivalrous knight.

"You do know that I was kidnapped and released from the Demon Castle, right?"

"Yes."

With the threat of the demon growing and its presence threatening Reinhardt, Charlotte has finally made up her mind.

"Then, I have a child who escaped with me."

"Like ......?"

"Yes."

Charlotte nodded.

"And I think he's probably the devil now."

"!"

The secret of secrets that only a few know.

Charlotte was going to share it with Ellen.

Very few people know about Charlotte's escape from the demon castle. Of the Temple students, only Charlotte, Bertus, and Reinhardt know the story.

So it's no wonder that Ellen was shocked to hear Charlotte's confession.

From start to finish, Charlotte described her escape from the demon castle.

How Bertus' vassals tried to kill him, and how the kid who brought the teleportation scroll with Darius rescued Charlotte.

Naturally, Ellen is shocked to learn that Charlotte has suffered hardships in the demon castle, but she has no idea that she has a child who escaped with her, and that child is the demon that is now shaking the continent.

"Of course I didn't realize it at the time, he was probably using camouflage magic, but that's not the point, it's almost certain that he's a demon now."

Charlotte bit her lip.

Like you've said everything you're going to say, and you're wondering if you really need to say this.

After thinking about it, Charlotte looked around.

The park in front of the Royal Class dormitory, on a weekend and early in the morning, with no one coming or going.

"I'll tell you, because it's something you need to know if you're going to keep living as my knight anyway."

"Yes."

"You know I'm a psychic, right?"

Ellen nods at Charlotte's words. But as far as Reinhardt knows, Charlotte is in serious trouble. She's suffering from some sort of aftereffect of her return from the Demon Castle, that's all he knows.

Charlotte's superpower.

Ellen doesn't know what it is.

Charlotte held still and extended her right hand.

-ssh

Ellen was almost sick to her stomach when she saw the inky darkness that was beginning to emanate from Charlotte's right hand.

I don't know what it is, but it's an ominous force to behold.

"I have the soul of a demon in my body."

"......what?"

What came next could only make Ellen even more appalled.

"The Devil did something to me when I was trapped in the Devil Castle, and I didn't know what it meant then, but I do now. He planted a piece of his soul in my body so that I could be resurrected, just in case."

Even Ellen, who was blasé about most things, could hardly contain her horror at the words coming out of Charlotte's mouth.

He escaped from the Demon City with the Demon Heir, and even has a portion of the Demon's soul dormant in his body.

The words were pouring out of Ellen's mouth that had long since surpassed the scope of her thinking, which envisioned something like an incurable disease.

"That the current Demon King, the child who escaped back then, saved me not to save me, but to save the Demon King's soul in my body."

"I didn't know it, I had some sense that he might be a demon, but I was deliberately ignoring it, even turning away from it, knowing how to find him."

"Admit it, I was stupid and weak, and I tried to believe he had my best interests at heart, but I don't anymore, and Reinhardt has saved me from this many times, and now the devil might be after him."

When Charlotte finished, she took a deep breath.

"I don't know if the devil is really behind this, but there's also a demonic cult involved, so I'm going to try and pick up the pieces that I've been deliberately turning a blind eye to, and I'm going to tell you all the secrets because it's not about you, and you're my knight."

Just as Ellen chooses to protect Charlotte regardless of her personal feelings, Charlotte recognizes Ellen as her knight regardless of her personal feelings.

"I don't want to burden Reinhard anymore, he'll try to do everything himself, and after all the times he's helped me, I don't want that anymore, so if you don't mind, I'd like to join you in tracking down the demon. I can't use anyone else, it's a matter of my most sensitive secrets, and I have to do it myself. Of course, there's no guarantee that we'll find out where it is, but something is better than nothing, and I'm going to try to do something about it."

Charlotte stares at Ellen.

"Would you like to join me?"

Investigating the Devil's Clue.

Charlotte attempts to reconnect the links that she has broken, with regret.

As the demon's presence begins to threaten the entire continent, Charlotte realizes that she must do something about it.

If it was his own foolishness that had led to this division, he resolved that he must do something to fulfill his minimum duty as royalty.

It's a clue you've already missed, but it might lead you to something.

"Yeah. Let's do it."

Ellen nods in agreement with Charlotte's suggestion.

If you can reach the demon, you can protect Reinhardt.

There was no reason for Ellen to deny it.
