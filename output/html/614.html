Who you are.

Ludwig stiffened at the shocking words.

Ludwig was left speechless by the realization that his opponent didn't even know him.

"I don't have time to convince a nag like you."

Treating nags.

Ludwig felt the urge to bite his tongue at that point.

"Back off, Ellen. I don't want to fight with you."

"......."

At this point, Olivia didn't speak to anyone except Ellen Artorius.

Even Louise is treated as if she's an afterthought, as if she knows that if Ellen steps down, everyone else will.

Ludwig's eyes light up as he watches Ellen, unable to draw her sword or retreat.

That hesitation.

The horror.

That fear and hesitation.

Ludwig clearly sees it.

In the first place, being a warrior is just a front.

It was impossible for Ellen to stand up to the Devil.

I still haven't gotten over my past feelings.

I wanted to do it just in case.

When Ellen faces the Devil, she may not be able to fight him.

Like Ellen's sensitive response to Christina's rant.

Whatever the truth, Ellen might not be able to hold a sword to the devil, Ludwig thought.

At this point, Ludwig has no choice but to check.

Ellen's inability to show hostility to the man who disappeared with the demon, let alone the demon.

Ellen is not the one to fight the devil.

This is where you realize.

-curl!

Ludwig's entire body is instantly enveloped in blue magic.

Understand that Ellen has no choice.

I don't blame Ellen.

But if no one steps up, if Ellen, for whatever reason, doesn't want to fight.

Someone else has to fight.

Don't let fear and panic hold you back.

Someone has to punish those demons.

"Ludwig! No!"

Ludwig started to leave, but Ellen quickly grabbed his shoulder.

"Are you....... No. Don't. You don't know anything. Don't do it. Don't fight."

Why I can't fight.

Why you can't draw your sword.

You don't know, Ludwig said, and Ludwig bit his lip.

"What don't I know?"

"......."

"What can't you tell me?"

Ludwig's words are echoed by Ellen.

You're disgusted with yourself for having to say it, but you know you can't help it.

"What you don't know, you're better off not knowing......."

When the Emperor and Tana tell her that she doesn't need to know about such things, Ellen insists that I do, and she tells Ludwig what she heard.

"It's all my fault. It's all my fault. That's all you need to know....... That's all you need to know......."

You don't know anything.

It's better not to know.

A little bit of truth is, after all, worse than nothing at all.

It will only make you feel like you don't deserve to know the truth.

"Okay, don't be silly."

In a tone that is both affectionate and murderous, Ludwig looks at Olivia this time.

"I don't know about Ellen or that princess over there and her superpowers, but you don't seem to care if you get screwed over, and I'll kill you for it."

Those words were the raw truth.

"There are things in the world you don't need to know, and there are things you can't figure out that will only make your head hurt, so just don't know, and don't waste your life being weird and stubborn."

It's a harsh statement, but it's also meant to keep Ludwig from jumping to his death.

There's no reason to approach the truth when it's useless and will only make you sad.

You're no match for me, and you're going to get your ass handed to you.

I don't even know who you are.

Therefore, you're an insignificant bastard who can die and no one will care.

Olivia's words, "I don't care if I have to kill you, I'll kill you if I have to," were the bitter truth.

In the face of that truth, Ludwig couldn't take a step back.

If you find yourself dead on the spot.

If you die.

What's going on?

If Ellen dies, it's a big deal. A warrior is dead.

Louise von Schwarz is the commander of the Schwarz Army. If she dies, the Allies will be thrown into chaos.

Heinrich is a very strong power for the Allies, and is performing at a similar level to Ellen.

None of them should be hurt or killed.

Only Ludwig is there.

They are the most unremarkable of the unremarkable.

Ellen gripped Ludwig's shoulder to keep him from making a move.

"So...... it is......."

If the guy who doesn't care if he dies goes out, he might actually die.

Because Olivia Lanchester might actually do it.

Ludwig couldn't help but notice that Ellen was desperately trying to put him off.

But that's already a weird situation.

The very fact that Olivia Lanchester cares about such things is strange.

Why doesn't Ellen attack Olivia.

Why Olivia doesn't want to fight with Ellen.

If Olivia Lanchester is on the Devil's side, we don't need to worry about that.

Not Ellen, not Louise, not Heinrich.

If they are his subordinates, you should try to kill them. All three would be a threat to him.

Olivia, however, would rather not touch the three of them, and would rather kill Ludwig, who is only a minor player.

And as if Ellen knew that, she stops Ludwig.

Olivia doesn't want to fight with Ellen, and Ellen doesn't want to fight with Olivia.

You don't draw your sword when you hear the shocking news that a demon has consumed the Five Great Houses.

That attitude is telling.

We don't know everything, but we do know one truth from this situation.

The only thing that this situation tells us is that they outwardly acknowledge that they're supposed to hate each other, but when it comes down to it, they can't touch each other.

They don't even hate each other.

I don't even consider it an enemy.

Ellen did not foresee or know about this situation.

However, they are panicked, but they don't end up fighting.

No, you can't fight it.

"From the beginning....... All....... Everything....... Everything people know......."

Ludwig mumbles to himself in disbelief.

"You were lying, weren't you......?"

Ludwig's eyes sank, dark and deep.



* * *



There was no way a fight was going to break out on the spot.

Heinrich and Louise were also silent, knowing the disastrous consequences of their actions.

There were only two types of people: those who never drew their swords, and those for whom drawing their swords was pointless.

In the end, we watched with open eyes as the Crusaders fell into the hands of the demon, and we could do nothing but retreat from the scene.

The Empire was reanimating the bodies of its fallen, creating an army of the undead.

The supposedly dead Rowen is somehow alive and well, and has taken control of the Order as a minion of the Devil.

You'll only know the result.

We could only wait to see the results.

No wonder Louise and Heinrich were as shocked as Ludwig was.

And Ellen's shock could not have been greater.

I couldn't help but feel the fear and horror of Reinhardt's truth, whether I knew it or not, and why he was doing this.

"Ludwig, I'm......."

"I don't know, I don't deserve to know, and what I do know won't make a difference."

After walking for a while, Ellen cautiously opened her mouth to speak, but Ludwig cut her off mid-sentence.

The ability to know something.

The need to not know something.

Is there such a thing.

"Well, no matter how stupid I am, I know that."

"......."

"If the Church of the Gods already belongs to the Devil, then you shouldn't have fought there."

Ludwig nodded slowly, as if he understood why Ellen hadn't fought.

"It's not about whether you can fight the devil or not, it's that you just realized you shouldn't have....... I get it now."

Ludwig now understood that if he messed up, the ecliptic would be shattered.

"I don't think anyone should know that the Cult of the Lord has fallen to the Devil, because if they do, it could lead to worse things."

Ludwig looks at Ellen and asks, should we keep this a secret?

Ellen has no answer.

He looks past Ellen, who doesn't answer, and this time Ludwig looks at Louise.

"Because innocent people might die, because they might get caught up in a fight they don't care about, because we have to do it to reduce casualties."

"......."

Ludwig doesn't blame Ellen.

Ludwig saw with his own eyes that Ellen could not fight the demon.

It's unavoidable.

Ludwig thinks to himself.

What if his dearest friends, like Lannion Sessor and Delphine, who were actually people he cared about, were actually demons?

Even if you were yourself, you wouldn't have drawn your sword.

I'm frustrated, angry, and sad.

I don't think I'll ever be able to fight back.

So, Ludwig was thinking that Ellen might be shaken, and he was right.

I don't blame Ellen.

And there's no reason to complain.

What you can't fight is what you can't fight.

It's the world's demand that Ellen must kill the demon, not her will.

Because it would be incredibly sad to see Ellen, who has already saved so many lives, resented for not being able to stab a demon.

But if you keep getting told you can't do this and you can't do that.

What's left but to say that nothing should be done.

What happens is what happens, and what happens is what happens.

It will be true in every moment that you have to leave it all alone.

And another problem.

As you heard from Christina.

That the Gate debacle wasn't necessarily the Devil's fault.

That there is some hidden truth.

Ludwig doesn't know what Ellen means specifically when she says that all he needs to know is that it's his fault.

The point is, you don't deserve to know the truth.

The reason is simple.

Because it's nothing.

Because you're not important.

They're worthless, so it's okay to kill them, and they don't deserve to know the truth.

Where the hell does that come from.

Who the hell gives you the right to know the truth.

The truth is now rather unimportant.

Whatever it was, Ludwig realized it was worthless.

So, now I don't even have to wonder.

The look on Ludwig's face as he crossed the threshold of helplessness and despair was rather dramatic.

"That's hard."

I'm just saying.

"It's too hard."

After passing through the Temple Gate, Ludwig hurried away, even though the path was the same.

"I'll go first."

No one is fighting.

Someone must have done something wrong.

What to do if no one wants to fight.

As he spoke, Ludwig's dark face and gait seemed more determined than ever.

As if you've just decided what to do.

As if you didn't already know.

Ellen watched Ludwig's back as he walked away, biting her lip.

Small and tiny.

All I could see was the dark, slimy backside of someone who was so small and insignificant that he eventually realized he had nothing to offer.

Olivia Ranze's rant about how four deaths won't affect the mainstream.

It was the raw, unvarnished truth.

Even if the reason for this was to keep Ludwig from doing anything rash, it doesn't change the fact that the words were true and stuck in Ludwig's mind like a badge of honor.

Louise sighs.

"The devil doesn't want the world to end, and the empire is bound to falter, so this is what happens."

Though she couldn't see the details, Louise could sense the vastness of the flow, and knew the past, present, and future to some degree.

I don't need Ellen to tell me, I can already feel it.

Rampaging heathen.

Carnage.

Take control of the Demon's Crusade Knights.

A warrior who can't fight.

A demonic minion who does not want to fight the warrior.

And.

The Silence of the Empire.

"You don't know what you wanted to know, but you know what you need to know."

I couldn't tell where Rowen's work ended and mine began.

I didn't need to know.

But in an odd twist, she learned something she needed to know.

What the royal family must do to survive going forward.

I realized which way the tide was turning.

Ruiz had failed as an individual and hadn't solved anything.

But as Princess of Cernstadt, she couldn't have been more successful.

Louise looks at Ellen, who stares blankly into the snowy void.

It was on the verge of collapse.

But something that can't be broken, so that its stony face doesn't crumple.

That pale, hardened look, like a piece of glass that could shatter at any moment.

Louise continued to stare.
