"I think those bodies got out as the undead, that's our conclusion, but what the Empire does is they take them and they regenerate them in those....... and reanimate them in these giant vats."

"Right."

"Then....... that what happened there had nothing to do with the Empire in the first place....... I think, but....... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to confuse you, I just thought maybe that's what happened......."

"No, you're right."

Ellen shook her head firmly when Ludwig tried to cloud her words.

"I don't need to ask Bertus to know that. It's clearly a different case, and there's no reason for the Empire to steal the graves of the Crusaders."

Crusader Grave Robbing.

And swapping bodies in a national cemetery.

That's a different case.

They work too differently, and the Empire has no reason to touch the Crusader Graveyard in the first place.

"So Rowen was investigating the wrong guy in the first place."

But it's just another labyrinth.

It's all the Empire's doing, but they didn't kill Rowen, and they had nothing to do with the theft from the Crusader catacombs.

Rowen then approaches Ludwig to go after the wrong guy.

Of course, there were enough similarities in the scene to make me think it was the work of the Empire.

However, they are technically two different events.

So who are the people behind the underground?

Did they kill Rowen?

"Now I really don't know what....... I have no idea."

Heinrich began to rack his brains.

"We don't have to think about this anymore. We're not obligated to reveal the truth."

Ellen said.

"I also wanted to find out why this archbishop named Rowen had approached Ludwig, and if he had any intention of killing me, but some things became clear: Rowen had approached Ludwig, and the reason was to investigate the Temple."

Not all questions are unanswered, so it's okay to let the case go with only unanswered questions.

It's not even an unjust death, as we learn that Rowen was involved in a lot of bad things; she literally did enough to deserve to die.

Karma, or should I say retribution.

If someone had retaliated against Rowen, it would have been what she deserved.

Ludwig mumbles to himself.

"Yeah, I guess I don't need to know everything......."

The truth you already know. The truth you know is overwhelming. Just enduring what's already happening is overwhelming.

It's painful enough to have to remain silent about something that's clearly wrong because it's real.

I don't think it's possible to dig any deeper into Rowen's work here, which is now completely lost.

"But when you give up, do it anyway. There's one last possible place."

Ellen says it's okay to let go, but she looks at everyone as if this is the last time she'll ever do it.

"The Crusader said that if the popes are trying to hide something from you, you can't know it."

"......Yes."

"And it's also true that the Crusader Master was hiding something from me."

Ellen says still.

"We need to find out what they're hiding, and even if they're not, the Crusaders are investigating this on their own. If they find anything, they might be willing to share it with us. If we don't get anything there, let's end this here."

The last ones to go.

Once again, to the Crusader Knightmaster.

And the Popes of the Five Great Houses.

We don't know if the truth they have has anything to do with Rowen's murder.

However, if I couldn't get anything out of it, it was time to dust myself off.



* * *



The case is a quagmire.

Unless the Empire, the most likely suspect, did this, the only other possibility is the pagans. But figuring out which one of them is the culprit is near impossible.

That's why Ellen decided to visit the Crusaders one last time.

But it was a sensitive issue.

'Commander, you can now visit....... It's okay if you stop helping him, you might get in trouble.'

That's why Ellen told Louise that she didn't need to get involved anymore.

'What's the point of that now? I'm coming.'

Having already learned too much about what not to know, Louise realized that she, too, must come to an end.

Whatever the secrets of the Crusaders are, they are greater than those of the Empire.

Once again, four people left the temple.

The four of you walked the length of the halted magic train to the Great Hall of the Crusaders.

"The director is out of the office."

With those simple words, the paladins guarding the main gate blocked Ellen's path.

"Then I'll wait inside until you get back."

"You're going to be gone for quite a while, so you won't be back anytime soon."

"......."

Ellen glares at the paladins guarding the entrance.

The attitude is odd for some reason.

I was also blocked when I tried to enter the burned temple. I could tell he was really troubled.

But for now, something.

It's a little weird.

"Are you saying you went back to the Allied garrison?"

"......Yes."

That's a lie.

There is no way that Elayon Bolton would have returned to the Alliance garrison without properly finalizing the events of the current ecliptic.

The gatekeeper is lying now, because he wouldn't have returned without knowing what was going on in the zodiac.

But why tell such a blatant lie?

And.

Ellen looks at her surroundings, not at the paladin in front of her.

The paladins guarding the gate all have their eyes on Ellen.

Ellen and the gang.

Ellen takes a step toward the paladin.

"......!"

As Ellen approaches, he takes a step back.

A slightly different look than last time.

"Why is it falling like this?"

Despite his armor, the corners of his eyes, his face, and his fingertips were trembling.

It looked terrified.

Why?

"You don't have to come back right away. I'm going to go inside, and if you're not there, I'll find someone who is."

The moment Ellen tried to pass.

"You're not allowed in."

"......."

The terrified paladin blocked Ellen with his body.

I don't know what happened, but this cleared it up for me.

The absence of a Templar isn't the point.

It's important that we don't let Ellen in.

"Get out of the way."

"...... is not allowed."

It wasn't just the paladin in front of her, but the other paladins as well, and Ellen could feel the tension in the air.

As the mood begins to turn sour, so do the expressions on the other three faces in the back as they wait for Ellen to finish her story.

"Maybe I'm in the right place."

Ellen shakes her head, looking at the terrified paladin.

"You want to see if I can force my way through. If you want to know, try blocking it one more time."

Ellen takes another step toward the entrance of the Great Hall.

This time, the gatekeepers were unable to stop Ellen in her tracks.



* * *



Ellen entered the battlefield instead.

The paladins who hadn't stopped Ellen stared at her back, their faces grim.

"...... That's weird."

Instead, it was a very strange sight.

Obviously, I came in with the idea that there was something there.

"Is anyone....... Why isn't he there?"

When I stopped by a few days ago, there were a lot of paladins and priests roaming around.

But now there was silence, with no one coming or going.

It can be incredibly disconcerting to be in an overly large space and not hear any sound.

Everyone was feeling that awkwardness.

"Something's going on."

"Let's go up."

The Crusaders' Great Hall, which seems to be nearly empty.

Ellen led the group up the stairs, if only to confirm the absence of the crusader leader.

My heart was beating in a strange rhythm.

What happens.

No, it happened.

Instead, the battlefield was empty.

It's as if you're trying to bite someone on purpose.

Soon, Ellen's quest to reach the upper levels, where the Crusader Knights' offices were located, was cut short.

-Pooh! Pow!

That's because I started hearing an eerie beeping sound.

"What......?"

The sound of something sharp tearing and cutting flesh.

-Thump! Thump!

The sound of something hitting a wall.

It was loud enough for Ellen, whose senses were far more acute than the average person's, to hear, as well as for the others.

It was so quiet in the room that the sound echoed even more clearly.

Ellen ran straight to where she heard it.

Close to the crusader leader's office.

Conference Room.

The sound was coming from there.

-Bang!

Without hesitation, Ellen kicked in the closed conference room door.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw what was happening in front of me.

Someone was killing people.

Ellen looks at the blood and dead people in the room.

Their flesh was strewn about, unrecognizable from how they had been torn and slashed.

The huge conference room was a pool of blood.

The person behind you slowly turns his head.

"No one told me to come this way......."

He turns around, sees Ellen, and twists his mouth into a grotesque grin.

"This would have been unstoppable."

"What....... What is this......?"

As Ellen froze and muttered, others arrived.

"Uh......?"

Ludwig could not help but be mesmerized by the scene of carnage and the man who seemed to be the master of it.

"Priest......?"

"Ah, Ludwig......."

She wipes the bridge of her nose with the back of her hand, holding the small sword in a reverse grip.

He tries to wipe the blood away, but it's a bizarre sight, with more blood smeared on his face.

"I see, Ludwig doesn't know anything......."

The look of regret on his face was palpable.

But the look of pure apology on his face, as opposed to the blood all over his body, only made him look more eerie.

"How did the priest......?"

Ludwig's reaction made it clear who the woman in front of him was.

Archbishop Rowen is alive.

A supposedly dead priest is on a killing spree in the great hall on the top floor of the Crusader Order.

And the paladins blocking the way at the entrance.

Empty substitution.

You can probably guess that this is not an isolated incident.

There was some collusion.

A conspiracy so big it's hard to fathom.

And dead people.

The clothes of the murdered, unrecognizable.

"You, who did you kill?"

At Ellen's question, Rowen shrugs.

"The popes."

The dead totaled five.

That was enough for Ellen to guess what was going on.

"By the way, have you guys seen Elion Bolton?"

"......what?"

"Where and how I smelled it. Because he ran away."

The crusader leader was not lying when he said he was out of town.

It's everyone's first time seeing Rowen in person except Ludwig.

"If you don't know, can you please stop interfering and get lost?"

"......what?"

"It's rude to stick your nose in other people's business."

I don't even know where things started anymore.

The priest who was said to be dead is alive.

For some reason, the priest is slaughtering five popes.

It's almost as if everyone in the room has moved out of the way.

Where.

What.

How did we get to this point?

Should I draw my sword?

Ellen's eyes were wide and her fingertips were shaking.

"I don't like that crazy bitch either, but I think we should leave her alone for now."

Suddenly, I heard a voice behind me, and I couldn't help but turn my attention to the hallway this time.

"It's all well and good for you to be all over the place, but why don't you back off?"

All four were even more aghast at the sudden appearance of the man.

"Olivia...... lanche?"

One of the three Temple students who disappeared with the Devil.

Olivia Ranze was looking at them.

Not Heinrich, not Ludwig, not Ruiz.

I was horrified, knowing that she should never have been in this position.

"I'll make it short."

Olivia looks at them, arms crossed, whether they realize she's there or not.

"From now on, the Crusader Knights and the Order of the Five Great Masters are ours. Well...... technically, we're just getting back on track."

"What did you say......?"

"So, go home thinking that's it."

Olivia was looking exactly at Ellen.

"You're smart, you know that if you start pulling knives around here, things are going to get weird, right?"

In the face of such an arrogant and imposing threat, Ellen felt like giving up on understanding the situation.
