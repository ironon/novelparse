As the clock ticked down to the end of the Round of 32 matches in Year 1, it was time for the winners' second round, the Round of 16. There were eight matches to be played in total.

Unsurprisingly, the first match of the round of 16 was Reinhardt's turn.

"Reinhardt, come on!"

Olivia squeaked.

-From now on, the round of 16 will be a best-of-three series.

The moderator further explained that the quarterfinals, the final group match of the day, would be a best-of-five, best-of-three format.

Reinhardt made eye contact with his supporters in the round of 32, but this time he wasn't looking at them.

You'd think they'd give it a chance.

Herriot thinks so.

"......Wait."

Olivia's giggling face hardened.

"That's kind of weird."

Ellen noticed something, too. Both Ellen and Olivia seemed to sense something that the rest of the audience did not.

"Why? What's going on?"

Olivia mumbled, her expression turning serious.

"Reinhardt's condition is....... looks a little unwell."

"I think there's a problem."

Neither Ellen nor Olivia had any intuition that something was wrong with Reinhardt's condition.

Meanwhile, off to the right of their seats, in a cluster of Class B students, Saviolin Tana watched Reinhardt with her arms crossed.

Like Olivia and Ellen, Saviolin Tana knew something was wrong with Reinhardt.

More accurately than the other two, of course.

"Reinhard is not used to enchantments."

"...... Probably, right?"

Charlotte knew that on some level.

"When you're pulling on a force you're not used to, you're going to get stuck."

"Limits?"

Reinhardt has always been successful at harnessing new power in times of crisis. But this time it's a little different.

This is a tournament, not a real game, and you need to keep fighting back-to-back.

Unfamiliar enchantments will cause you to become unwell the more you use them.

"Reinhardt would be vulnerable to a back-to-back."

The problem with using enchantments was that they would become increasingly unhealthy as the number of fights increased.

Not all of the Royal Class students in attendance were there to cheer Reinhardt on.

However, on some level, I was already convinced that Reinhardt would win.

Ludwig and Scarlett are great, but Reinhardt can do magic, too.

But now he realized that the enchantment would inevitably lead to Reinhardt's downfall.

Charlotte looks at Reinhardt, who has a worried, stern look on his face.

"If I don't use a magical enhancement and....... without using magic enhancements?"

"That would be the best way to go, but....... It might work for today, but what about tomorrow......."

Clumsy strength comes at a cost.

-Let's get started on the first match of the Temple Tournament Round of 16!

With the call of the moderator, the first match of the Round of 16 began.



* * *



The round of 16 ended 2-0 in my favor.

There were no dangerous moments.

However, there were a couple of dangerous moments in the first set when I tried to avoid using Enchantment.

While my opponent was a common class, he wasn't someone I could ignore in the end, and I was forced to pull out my Enchantment again in the second set.

It's entirely possible that a student in the regular class could train for a year without being accepted into the Orbis class and outperform the Orbis class.

I tried to solve it with self-implication, but it didn't work out as well as I thought it would.

Of course, I did manage to pull off two wins without using any enchantments.

When I returned to the waiting room, I was greeted by Ludwig and Scarlett.

The waiting room also had its own inside bleachers so I could watch the game. I think Ludwig and Scarlett watched me play from there.

"That was great, Reinhardt."

"Good job."

"......."

Enchantment.

I was realizing that it was a double-edged sword.

No wonder.

It's a power you've only used twice before today. You succeed on your third try, but you pay the price for using a power you're not yet familiar with.

I didn't pass out, but my entire body felt as heavy as a soaked cotton ball.

He had to face the next game without enough time to recover.

This is not a common injury and is not a condition that can be healed by an on-call priest.

This was fine until the round of 16.

However, the upcoming quarterfinals of the Group A main draw will be best-of-five, and tomorrow's semifinals will be best-of-three.

I don't know about you, but I don't feel confident in beating Gladen Amorelle, Ludwig, or Scarlett without an enchantment.

If you have a bad day today and don't get back on track tomorrow, or if you pull out too much in the semifinals tomorrow.

I may not win.

I was under the illusion that the enchantment was all mine.

I was sitting still in the player's waiting area, watching the next match in the round of 16.

-Ka-ching!

A bear, or perhaps a human chariot, was roughing up his opponent.

Enchantments are powers that increase your physical abilities by leaps and bounds.

-Thump!

The -1 set was won by Mr. Richard Howleman of the Irajon class!

The one who stomps on the off-balance opponent wins the first set.

I don't know about you, but I'm sure you'll overwhelm me in strength.

That's my last opponent for the day. He's a bit of a bad match for me right now.

I wonder if I can beat that guy without using enchantments.

My fingers were shaking uncontrollably.



* * *



The rule of thumb is that losers leave the queue, so the queue, which was quite large a while ago, has thinned out.

Year 1 of the Irajon class.

Richard Howleman.

It was clear that I would be facing the same human tank that I'd been dueling against in the quarterfinals of the Group A main event.

"Rilka is in that class."

"Oh....... Really?"

Gladen Amorell explained it to me as if he knew. I can't believe Rilka Aaron is in the same class as that asshole.

I'm not close to him, but I'm subtly worried.

"I hear he's got a reputation for being a brutal bastard, and he says he got weeded out in the personality screening for the Orbis class, though I'm not sure how that really is."

There's a chance that the talk of the Orbis class is just hype, but they actually made it to the main tournament, so we know they're not blowing smoke.

He's as much a character as he is a skill.

"He's just like me."

"Haha....... That's how it works."

Gladen Amorell smirked. This guy has somehow gone from being a douchebag to just plain nice.

Of course, in a matchup between Gladen Amorel and Richard Howleman, the result would be a clear-cut win for Gladen Amorel.

I've seen Ludwig, Scarlett, and this guy play.

This guy is definitely the best of the bunch here, aside from all the others.

Assuming I don't use Enchantment, I'm not going to beat this guy. I've heard that Self-Suggestion has reached Rank A, but I'm not sure if that's enough to give me a clear advantage.

I don't know about using the power of words, but I haven't figured out how to make that work yet.

-click!

The winner, Richard Howleman, bursts through the doors of the bleachers and stares at me.

"Are you ready, royal class dregs?"

"......."

The victory is now in doubt.

Because I knew the enchantment wasn't really my power.

He looked at me with an unmistakable sneer.

"Why aren't you talking, are you getting a little scared?"

I looked up at him, crossed my arms, and smirked.

"I heard you failed the Orbis class character test."

"Yeah. It didn't go in, not that it didn't go in."

"What's toughness, I don't think it's toughness, I think it's the fact that you look like a beggar and you've been eating shit, don't you?"

His face contorted, and I chuckled.

This.

It's better to swear at a problem that can't be solved than it is to swear at a problem that can't be solved.

"That's so fucking ugly. That's what you call a face. You look like you're rotting your eyes out. Get out of here and wash up some of that gravy. You smell like a pig."

I mean, there's nothing like a personal attack.

"You son of a bitch......!"

"Hit it. If you want to get disqualified."

I got right in his face. I chuckled as I watched his eyes roll back in his head. He raised his fist, but couldn't reach it.

If you stretch, you're disqualified.

I laughed at Richard Howleman, whose fist was crying.

"I thought you had a bad temper. I'm guessing you don't have a problem with character, but it's really your face that got you rejected?"

"This dog......."

"La, Reinhard....... Stop it......."

Eventually, Ludwig and Scarlett tore me apart. Gladen Amorell thought this was going to get him in trouble, so he left the bleachers with a very angry Richard Howleman.

We weren't the only ones in the bleachers.

All the other guys were looking at me like I was a mad dog.

Where's that asshole from regular class?

I also have a royal personality.

"......Reinhardt, I really don't understand what you're doing."

Eventually, Ludwig, a man of true character, was told.

"I'm so glad we're in the same class as Reinhardt......."

Scarlett sighed heavily.



* * *



Everything worked as expected.

Scarlett, Ludwig, and Glayden Amorel advanced to the finals of their respective brackets with no upsets. The first-year tournament was down to the final match of the day for each.

The variable is that my enchantments are eating away at my conditioning.

If I win two games in a five-game, three-way group final, but then collapse in a heap of blood in the last three games due to illness, it's still my loss.

-Waaaahhhhh!

The crowd went wild as it was now just a game for the big boys.

Of course, I still don't see what the fun is in this.

As someone who grew up watching warlords in full body armor fly around and shoot laser beams out of their hands, it's just not a fun thing to do.

This world is a cultural barrenness.

To be spectacular, you'd have to have a superhuman vs. superhuman matchup, but that's not what a first grade tournament is about.

An unlimited tournament would be a spectacle in that regard.

Finally, the final duel of the day.

I watch Richard Howleman stand across from me. He stares at me with eyes that seem to consume me.

Why did I keep putting in the ipsilon, even though it was a bit much?

Honestly, I do it just for the hell of it, but I do it for the look on his face.

If your opponent is the kind of person who loses their cool and gets excited easily, there's no reason why you shouldn't make them do the same.

It's best to win without using any enchantments.

If you can make an overwhelming weight difference with enchantments, you won't have to worry about this, but for now, I'm not going to use enchantments.

If so, you should go into battle with a clear understanding of the differences between you and your opponent.

My weapon of choice is the Longsword.

The Longsword is an ambidextrous sword, but not so much so that it can't be wielded with one hand, so you can switch between one-handed and two-handed use.

The saber is approximately one meter long.

However, Richard Howleman's weapon of choice, a two-handed sword commonly referred to as a zweihander, is the emitter.

The sword is about 1.8 meters long, which is about my height.

A weapon that outreaches my weapon in reach and outweighs it.

His sword is too long to balance his weight when thrusting, so his weapon has a ricasso that allows him to hold it above his guard and swing it.

It has an extension handle, so to speak, and Parrying Hooks, a second guard designed to defend against ricochets.

A sword that looks like a regular sword with an extra handle and guard.

Judging by his physique, he should be able to handle that greatsword with one hand to some extent.

He's got the range, he's got the height.

Like in his duel with Rilka Aaron, where he was eventually forced to stick to kicking because of his small stature. Being in the same weight class as Lich is already a deal breaker in itself.

You have to admit it and go with it.

The opponent has the advantage under the minimum conditions.

But when have I ever fought a losing battle.

A monstrous man with a monstrous sword will eventually be weaker than any opponent I've ever faced.

It's only the quarterfinals.

I've gotten stronger, but in the end, I've just recognized that I'm not perfect, and I can't be perfect.

It's just that the penalty is that I have to fight to keep one of my most important powers sealed away.

In the semifinals or finals if you're using a disenchantment.

Now is not the time.

-The quarterfinals of the Gradias Temple Tournament begin now, with Reinhardt of the Royal class facing off against Richard Howleman of the Irazon class!

-Waaaaaah!

-Reinhardt! Come on!

Olivia's cries sounded piteous.

There.

-Reinhardt!

I even added a voice I didn't think I'd ever hear.

Even as the showdown began, I couldn't help but turn my head in surprise.

Ellen made a hand trumpet and shouted.

-Win!

I hadn't expected Ellen to do that, so I was surprised, as well as Harriet and Riana, who were sitting next to her.

It's just a shout out.

But everyone who knows Ellen knows that it's very rare to see her like that, and that's why they're so surprised. Olivia watched in amazement from the sidelines as Ellen screamed at the top of her lungs.

Ellen does something she doesn't do, something you wouldn't expect her to do.

Ellen looks at me and exclaims.

-If you don't win, I'll kick your ass!

Most of all, I was surprised.

It's not self-explanatory.

It's not as if I've gotten better.

By the way.

Oddly enough.......

My hands stopped shaking.

So far, I've been relying on self-implication for everything.

When I believe in myself, I change, and it has shaped me so far. All the power I didn't have came from it.

But for once, it doesn't come from there.

For once, there are no superpowers, no exorcisms, no manifestations, and no enchantments.

Win.

Ellen's cry stopped all trembling.

It shouldn't make anything better, because a word of encouragement shouldn't be able to restore the broken balance of the body caused by the instability of the magic circuitry.

Why.

Why am I feeling like everything is okay?

"Huhhhhhh!"

Why.

A human tank is hurtling toward me.

"......."

I wonder if it's because I don't feel like I'm going to lose at all.
