There is such a thing as common sense.

Something that is universally accepted as true among people.

But common sense is not the truth.

Common sense is sometimes wrong, and there are exceptions.

One of those common sense things.

You will never be able to take on a Master Class at your enchantment level.

As Ellen struggled to keep from being trampled by the crowd, she was watching her assumptions disintegrate in real time.

An imposing auror sword wielded by a mysterious elderly man, while Reinhardt parried with only his Alsbringer.

-Kwaggagang!

Worse, it was overwhelming.

The shockwave from the clash of sword against sword ripped and crushed the earth, and Reinhardt was not so much receiving the Auror sword as he was deflecting and crushing it.

An Auror sword isn't just a sharp sword.

Depending on how the sword's magic is utilized, it can be extremely sharp, or it can deliver a devastating blow with an energized shockwave.

Masterclasses are like using a blunt instrument with a lot of weight.

And things like that, universally, shred the weapon once it hits, as well as the arms and wrists that receive it.

It should be.

No matter how much your physical abilities have been enhanced by enchantments, master classes are more sophisticated and efficient.

So, Reinhardt shouldn't be able to handle a master class.

But Ellen saw that Reinhardt was not being outplayed, but rather was pushing his opponent.

-Kuung! Koo-goo-gung!

The winds of shockwaves from the clash of sword against sword could reach Ellen's face from a distance.

The master class is losing out to someone who can only disenchant.

There's only one reason this shouldn't happen.

Reinhardt is too strong.

You shouldn't be able to force it, it's just snapping and pressing with too much force.

Reinhardt's massive magical enhancement, which appeared to be engulfed in blue flames, showed that Reinhardt's power was beyond measure.

It's less sophisticated and therefore less efficient.

However, it has too much power.

He doesn't have master-level maneuverability, but his base condition is overwhelming, and he pushes his opponents with sheer force, sheer wits, and sheer horsepower.

What to do if Reinhardt becomes dangerous.

I might have to go help Reinhardt, even if it means risking misunderstanding and people's judgment.

That's what I was thinking, but I didn't even need to.

Reinhardt was too strong.

Moreover, Reinhardt's opponent is not just a master class.

-curl!

The mysterious man stretched out his left hand, and black flames erupted from beneath his feet, engulfing Reinhardt.

What Reinhardt was dealing with now was a monster that was both a master class and an archmage.

Amidst the earth-melting flames, Reinhardt emerged unscathed and continued the rough-and-tumble.

Despite the lightning bolts and black flames that shot from the man's hands, and the frigid chill that froze the air, Reinhardt pushed through as if none of it could affect him.

Just as Reinhardt's physical prowess was overwhelming, Ellen could tell that his anti-magical powers were already beyond the killer's level.

The crowd, fleeing from one another, watched in horror.

No one knew who it was that was trying to kill the Demon King, but everyone could tell from a mile away that he was a formidable fighter.

But the devil is stronger.

Moreover, not only the man but also the other raiders continued to attack the demon.

But all the sobriety, magic, and curses they used were having no effect on the demon's body.

The sobriety they had accumulated could not affect the demon's body in any way.

-Curl! Kurrrrr!

But the demon was blowing them up with one look.

A demon of fire, enveloped in blue magic.

It can even ignite an infinitely condensed spark to create a massive explosion.

The crowd could only watch in horror as he slaughtered a group of Swordmasters, Archmages, and Demon Swordsmen in a single bound.

Demon, you're too strong.

"We are....... We're all going to die......."

There were a lot of people who just sat there, immobilized.

Who in the world can take on a demon like that?

Who in the world can hurt the Absolute, who can't be hurt by magic, who can't be hurt by an Auror blade.

It's not the master class, it's the failure to reach it that makes it so terrifying.

I'm still doing that.

What a scourge the devil will be when we get to the master class.

The fear of the demon was even greater for those who saw it, as it was not yet fully grown.

Of course, not all attacks were immune to the demon.

The raiders, some of whom had reached the master class, began their assault. Some even managed to pierce the fiery demon's magical defenses and inflict wounds.

No matter how strong the demon is, it can't easily withstand the onslaught of master classes.

Numerous offensive spells rained down on the demon, and Reinhardt was soon backed into a corner.

-POOF!

"!"

Ellen squinted and watched as the Auror's spear pierced Reinhardt's heart.

The decisive gap.

It didn't miss, and succeeded in inflicting a critical wound.

"Ah, ah, ah. Ah. ah....... Ah, no. No....... No."

Ellen began to shiver and freak out, but the crowd, who were pushing and shoving and fleeing from each other, were wide-eyed.

The demon is dead.

An unnatural silence descended on the chaotic public square.

But.

He holds the spear that pierced his chest with his left hand.

-POOF!

With his heart pierced, he pulled out the spear that had pierced his heart with sheer force.

Then, the devil raises his hand.

-Woof!

In the demon's other hand, which has been holding only the Alsbringer, another sword with a milky white hilt is summoned.

Relic of Tuan, God of Purity.

Tiamata.

-Whoosh!

A holy white light floods Tiamata, and the wound in the demon's chest regenerates.

-Ah....... ah....... aaah.......

Those who had foreseen the demon's death could not help but be horrified by the sight.

-die....... not.......

It's hard to physically break through that massive barrier of magic, and magic rarely works.

Even if somehow pierced, a demon wielding Tuan's divine power will recover from the wound quickly.

-The Devil is Immortal....... The devil is immortal.......

A near-invincible firewall.

A masterclass in mastery.

An overwhelming amount of horsepower released with no end in sight.

And play.

-Nonsense....... nonsense.......

A demon of immeasurable power, whose holy relics allow him to borrow and regenerate the power of the gods at will, and whose sword of war grows stronger the more enemies he faces, and the stronger they are than he is.

Who the hell.

How.

You can kill a demon like that.

That absolute.

That immortal being that can't seem to die.

Who the heck can you play against.

The crowds weren't the only ones tired of the sight of a spear being pulled out of a heart with bare hands.

Reinhard lunges at the frozen, elderly man without giving him a moment's notice.

-Quizik!

Then, with a swift grab of the old man's graying hair, she slammed his head into the floor.

-Thump!

With a fierce crack, Reinhardt slams Alsbringer down, aiming for the head of the man on the ground.

-Bam!

Auror armor was not shattered by the demon's blow.

-Bam!

However, if it doesn't break the first time, you can take a second shot and throw it away.

-Bam!

Three times.

-Bang!

Four times.

-Bang!

Five times.

-Quack!

Six times.

-Quizik!

Then, on the seventh, the sound of something breaking echoed coldly through the great hall.

I crushed the Auror-armored master class with my might.

We didn't stab them to death, we smashed them to death.

Their leader was killed before they had a chance to react.

Literally, crushed to death.

Archmage and master class.

Head of the Black Order.

He was slain by the demon in a futile and senseless manner.

Still exuding the same momentum as at the beginning, the Demon King looked at the Master Classes that had been conspiring against him.

Those who have stood in the demon's way so far begin to slowly retreat.

As if this didn't kill the devil, and now it's just a dog's death.

People despair as they watch the raiders begin to flee.

We don't know who they are.

A group of very strong players attacked the demon.

However, it failed.

Only that simple truth will stick in people's minds.

In the middle of the ecliptic.

That's where this happened.

Who could possibly take on an immortal demon?

-Run away, run away, run away!

After holding out hope and dwelling on the thought that the demon might be dead, they begin to run in panic once more as the raiders flee.

"Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Get out of the way!"

Countless people passing by Ellen tapped her on the shoulder, shoved her, and screamed for her life as she stood there dazed.

-Puck!

And just like that, Ellen, staring blankly at Reinhardt, was knocked off her feet by the shoulders of the fleeing men.

With that, the deep hood that Ellen had been wearing came off.

"ah......."

"Uh......."

People running away see it.

She looks at Ellen's face and freezes, as if frozen.

In the ecliptic, there are few who don't recognize Ellen's face.

Although few people saw her in person, Ellen's face was familiar through portraits and propaganda.

"Warrior......?"

People stop to look at Ellen, who is frozen in place.

Suddenly, Ellen was struck by an ominous premonition.

"A warrior!"

Someone shouted.

-Sir?

-Ellen is here?!

-Sir?

-Mercenary.......

Ellen felt her blood run cold.

My fingertips trembled, my lips quivered.

-The warrior has come to save us!

The cheers were getting louder.

Through the crowd, through the roar.

Ellen saw Reinhardt standing in the distance, looking at her.

"Hero, please, please, please defeat the demon!"

One of the fleeing men cries and pleads with Ellen.

The looks on everyone else's faces were no different.

A warrior would be different, or so we like to believe.

"I, I, I....... I, I am....... I am......."

I.

I.

What the hell.

How?

Why?

It was as if her brain had failed her, and she couldn't think of anything or draw any conclusions.

People help Ellen up from her fall.

The fleeing people turn to Ellen and beg her to defeat the demon.

Some pray while crying, others stand still and tremble.

Please defeat the devil.

Ellen is pushed into the square by the crowd.

Reinhardt stood still, staring at Ellen Artorius as she was pushed through the crowd.

They don't know what to do, but they want you to do something.

He pushes Ellen away from the slaughtering demon, and the people flee.

However, there were those who watched from afar, hoping to catch a glimpse of the spectacle somehow.

Demons and heroes.

The distance between them was great.

Reinhardt stared at Ellen in silence.

Ellen shuddered, her complexion turning white.

Why.

Why on earth would you do this.

Why you should reunite in this situation.

Reinhardt's face was expressionless.

Why.

With that look.

With a completely emotionless expression.

Why are you looking at me like that.

"I, I....... La, Reinhard....... I am......."

I don't want to fight.

I don't want to fight with you.

Killing too.

Dying.

Reject.

Ellen swallows the words, her lips trembling.

Reinhard walks over to Ellen, who is trembling.

Toward Ellen, who summoned neither Rafelt nor Lament.

"It's ......."

Reinhardt leaps up, turns to Ellen, and says, "Nazik.

"spirit......."

"......!"

"Don't you want to go?"

-Bam!

"Hmph......!"

Into Ellen's abdomen, Reinhardt's fist went.

-Quack!

With a single blow to the abdomen, Ellen was sent flying across the great plaza to a building, where she was slammed against the wall.

Reinhardt walks slowly toward Ellen Artorius, who is pinned against the wall of the building, ignoring the crowd's gasps of horror.





"ugh....... ugh...... ugh....... ugh......."

I was caught unprepared.

"Kwak! Kwak! Kulk! Kek!"

I managed to activate my Auror armor just in time to avoid being hit, but Ellen coughed up a stream of blood.

"Ah....... Ugh......."

You probably didn't mean to kill it.

But it was in hands that were never meant to be gentle.

Ellen looks up in fear at the approaching Reinhardt.

Than the gut-wrenching pain.

Than the pain of coughing up blood.

Seeing Reinhardt's emotionless face was Ellen's greatest fear right now.

That stare, like an enemy's, was Ellen's greatest fear.

"ugh....... ugh....... Hmph......."

"What would happen if people knew that a warrior was afraid to fight a demon?"

Reinhardt approaches, his face emotionless.

"What I could never do, you can do."

To be a symbol of hope.

That's impossible for the devil.

Only Warriors.

Only a warrior can be a symbol of hope.

Therefore, a warrior who falters in the face of the devil will only bring despair to all.

In their despair, they can only envision a future where humanity is destroyed by the devil, and a world without hope is doomed to collapse.

So you have to fight.

You have to fight for it.

Even if it's a false hope, it has to be there.

Even if it's a false hope, people need to believe in it so they can somehow attach themselves to reality.

It's okay to have demons because we have heroes.

One day, a hero will defeat the devil.

Because people need to believe that to keep this world on the brink of collapse.

"So pay attention."

The demon looks down at the warrior in fear and terror.

"Wake up. Unless you want to die."

Demon.

Valerie raises her foot toward Ellen.

-Bang!

The building began to crumble as the enchanted demon's foot slammed down where Ellen's head had been.

Ellen quickly rolls to the side and looks at Reinhardt.

Ellen's eyes were filled with terror, despair, and fear.

Why I.

Why you.

"I am...... Reinhard....... Reinhard I am......."

"Shut up."

Valier looks at Ellen with a cold stare.

"Me, don't call me that."

This is not the time for a touching reunion.

Too many people are watching.

I know that's why I'm doing this.

Ellen sees Reinhardt staring at her in fear and horror, the same way he stares at his enemies.

Ellen realizes.

I.

I can't.

You can take Charlotte with you, but.

That I am the hope of humanity, and they will never take me away.

He knows that people are projecting their hopes onto him, and he would never take himself for their hopes.

That harsh reality and truth.

Ellen couldn't help but notice the look in Reinhardt's eyes.

I felt like I was about to burst into tears.

But I couldn't cry.

A warrior who faces a demon should not cry in the face of a demon.

Never, ever, ever.

A solemn-looking demon approaches.

"You, do what you have to do."

"......."

"I'll do my thing."

I wanted to sit down.

I wanted to collapse and cry.

Rather, I wanted to die.

But people were turning their heads and watching the confrontation and walking away.

Ellen staggers to her feet.

And, while still looking horrified.

It was a hard pill to swallow.

Just as Reinhard had to carry something, Ellen has to carry something.

They can't escape the shackles of hero and devil.

So, the devil may take the hated maiden, but he never takes the hero.

Now, no matter what, we can't be together.

In Ellen's hand was the Sword of the Moon.

The Cloak of the Sun is draped over Ellen's shoulders.

With shaky eyes, the warrior stares at the demon.

Reinhardt.

No.

Demon, go to Bali.

The warrior, Ellen Artorius, approaches.
