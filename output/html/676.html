You've won.

You have gotten, and will get, a lot.

However, despite the victory, there is something to lose.

That's probably unavoidable.

There was still a lot we didn't know.

What happened to Antrianus, who absorbed the souls.

I don't know how I managed to stay safe.

Ellen left.

He would have left me for his own reasons.

I can't obsess over that anymore.

Every end touches a new beginning.

You're going to have more work to do.

It's time to really get to work on the karma of being the ruler of the world.

On such a subject, one cannot be broken by the loss of a single person. Such a man would be unworthy to be the ruler of the world.

Get out of bed and straighten your clothes.

I'm not a superhuman.

However, you have to go the superhuman route.

Then I should at least imitate her as much as I could. Herriot looked at me as if I were a completely different person.

I'm not surprised or saddened that Ellen left.

There's no such thing as time to fuss.

What you get back is what you get back.

What's lost is lost.

Don't delay.

"Pfft."

"......Yes."

"Let's go to Charlotte."

I must be a different person from now on, a different person than I have ever been.

Someone so thoroughly different that you forget you even exist.

You will be the loser of the continent.



* * *



In my absence, Charlotte was at the Allied Command Center, assessing the damage, treating the wounded, and overseeing everything else going on around Diane.

So, around the barracks of the General Headquarters, the highest authorities in the armed forces came and went.

Where you could only get in by spying, you now have a front row seat.

It's bizarre.

Pulling Charlotte aside, I filled her in on the current state of the Allied forces.

"The damage is considerable, and there's still a lot of confusion. Most of the troops don't even know we're in charge of the Alliance, and if they do, it's going to be even more confusing, so we're trying to get each of the military leaders to come in."

Even at the top, they weren't sure if this was right or not, what the hell happened to the empire, or where the hate was going.

It's also ridiculous to say that the Allied forces here have been consumed by the devil.

Noise and chaos are inevitable, but you don't have to intentionally amplify them.

"We'll have to decide if we want to go loud or quiet."

"In a big way, yes."

Do you announce your reign of terror, or do you hide it like it's something you're not?

If you hide it, you're afraid of the fallout; if you reveal it, you're afraid of the immediate chaos.

"More importantly, the return of the Union army. The Union army has been marching from all over the country, and it's going to take time and food to get them back safely, and that's not the end of it, it's going to take a lot of money and time to get them back to where they belong."

Yes.

It took an enormous amount of resources just to get humanity to this point.

The war is over, but it's not really over until these troops return home safely.

You'll have to send them all home.

How to move and how to dissolve.

Just getting the Alliance back to the ecliptic, the primary return point, will take nearly a year. In the meantime, we must feed our troops.

The list of things that could make my head explode is already making me gasp.

"Over there......."

Charlotte and I are talking about a problem we're both stuck on, when Harriet cautiously interrupts.

"That's....... I think I can do something about it."

"......?"

As it turns out, Herriot had invented the warp gate system.

"But is that a nexus or something....... Didn't you say you needed something like that?"

However, you will need to create a warp gate. You can't build a warp gate that will take you straight back to the ecliptic from here.

But if you think about the time it would take to rebuild the gate facilities that have all been destroyed so far, that's still going to take a lot of time, isn't it?

"No. I can send the entire coalition, all of them, anywhere in the world, not just the ecliptic, at a moment's notice."

This guy again.

What did I do?



* * *



During the Battle of Diane, I didn't really know what was going on in different parts of the country.

It was taking all my energy just to get away from Immortal.

So I heard about the strange magical orbs that appeared in the rear of the battlefield.

Spells that draw from nature's mana and manifest it into magic.

For example, a spell that draws mana from the atmosphere to cast a spell.

I had no idea how it worked.

But at least I knew that Herriot had actually done what I was talking about.

Importantly, the magic allows for a spatial leap of such magnitude that the entire Alliance can be transported from this location straight back to the ecliptic.

Herriot fidgets with his fingers, looking nervous.

"I don't know what to call it, but....... It's magic like that."

"You are, you are the real......."

"ah......."

As if realizing what was about to happen, a pale-faced Herriot backed away.

"It's my best paktong!"

-Wrong!

"I knew it!"

I hugged him vigorously, and he freaked out, as he always does.

This magical genius has reduced armaments on an astronomical scale with a single spell.

Charlotte watched with a fascinated expression as I hugged Harriet and tried to figure out what to do.

"Oh, thank...... god. Just sending this army back was going to take my breath away, so what are we going to do?"

Great, sublime, noble, even beautiful and cute, the best paktong in the universe blew away all the problems at once.

Overt or covert?

You don't need them all.

"All Allied forces withdraw. Tear them all apart."

All armies go home at once.

In the end, it doesn't matter who is king of the world or who sits on top of your head.

After all, all soldiers want is to come home alive.

You can't hate us for paving the way for you to come back alive.



* * *



The Allies withdraw.

And I'm heading somewhere, walking through the Allied lines, who are busy cleaning up the mess.

There are some things you need to see.

I arrived at the Temple Royal class garrison.

As I walked in, I couldn't help but notice the mood change as well as the expressions on the faces of those who recognized me.

The Royalist side will already know that the Demon has taken control of the Alliance.

But actually seeing me is a much different thing.

In the frozen atmosphere, I met the fearful stares directed at me.

But there were bound to be some guys who would beat me without fear.

"Hey."

Conor Lindt.

He walks up to me and holds out his hand.

Just as he approached me without hesitation, I grasped his hand firmly.

"Yeah."

Without him and Scarlet, the Alliance might have been wiped out.

In a way, Scarlett and Kono Lint have done more important work than I have.

There are casualties in the Royal Class, but none that I know of are dead.

Adriana, Scarlett, Erich, and Cliffman.

Everyone else is fine.

Literally, it was a miracle.

But it's also a no-brainer.

Things have changed a lot since then, but they were much larger and stronger than they were in the original.

So the absolute number of casualties is very, very small compared to the original.

"What about the others?"

"What's everyone doing....... stare at."

But Kono Lindt's face was not happy.

"And Kaier?"

"......I'm still not getting up."

"......Yes."

Everyone is safe, but one.

We were told that Kaier Bj√∏rden was in a coma.



* * *



I opened the tent and walked in, and there was a familiar face.

"Ah, ah, ah......."

"It's been a while."

Redina, who could no longer be called a child, looked at me and jumped out of her seat.

He wanted to say something, but his mouth fell open.

Even if you don't hate me, you will all fear me.

There are very few guys like Kono Lint who can get to me first.

"I'm just here to see."

"......."

At my words, Redina bowed her head deeply.

On the cot in front of the chair where Redina was sitting, Kaeir lay.

While it's great that everyone is safe, someone is bound to get hurt.

Kaier was not a hand-to-hand combatant.

Redina explained it slowly, with a grimace.

Redina had promised Kaier that she would use the Arc Crystal sparingly in the final battle, as the Immortals would take over her role.

"My immortal is gone, so....... I had no choice but to use the arc crystal."

But the immortal suddenly disappeared.

As he waited, Kaier had no choice but to charge his Arc Crystal.

They fought, recharging their Arc Crystals in real time as they used them to their limits, and Kaier charged his beyond his limits.

So before the battle was over, Kaier was already in a coma.

Herriot wouldn't have been able to cast the magic needed for every location on the battlefield.

A great deal of horsepower, and Redina using it.

That alone could have saved a lot of people's lives.

In return, Kaier remained in a coma with no indication of when he would return to consciousness.

Redina starts to cry.

"You must....... I promise."

"......."

"We're going to make a world where everyone is happy....... I promise."

A world where everyone is happy.

How childish.

The reason it's childish is that even a child would realize that it's impossible.

The kids know, and Redina, no longer a little girl, cries and begs.

There is no such thing as a happy world.

I can't promise you that.

In front of a crying Redina with a messed up face.

"By all means, just like that....... I'll do that."

I couldn't say that.



* * *



"That's it."

"Right."

The look on Adriana's face when she said that was more of a sense of frustration than excitement.

It was a moment when I had only one goal: to end the Gate debacle.

That was the absolute goal, the absolute good.

That absolute good was done.

Adriana and I had been trying to survive each other, and here we were, reunited, alive and well.

There are no absolutes to follow now. From now on, it will be a time of choices and decisions. In the midst of it, we may make the wrong choice, the wrong decision, and cause something irreversible to happen again.

Some of us would never see them again.

Someone is actually dead.

Adriana and I survived.

"Now, you're going to be a continental emperor?"

Adriana looked at me and gave me a strange smile.

A continental emperor.

Yes, it should be something like that.

"Maybe."

"Hmmm......."

"...... Why?"

At my answer, Adriana gave me a stern look and then slapped me on the shoulder.

-Bang!

"Why, why are you hitting me?"

"If you're going to use vague words like "maybe" for a topic that's going to be such a big deal, do you think it's going to make me or anyone else believe you, so why don't you say it with more conviction?"

Adriana's expression as she forced her eyes to open was both fierce and cute.

Right.

I'm done being vague.

No, rather, it seems to me that people in that position only say vague things.

Of course, you don't need to copy that.

"Yes, I'm sure it will."

"Yeah, that's the way it should be."

Adriana smirked, as if she was finally starting to like it.



* * *



As I walked around the Royal Class garrison, I saw a few familiar faces. Those who knew of me looked at me with fearful eyes from afar.

Until I called for Scarlett and Conor Lint, Cliff was the only thing keeping me going.

I miraculously made it to the master class and was told that I was instrumental in saving Riana and Herriot.

A talent named Combat.

Klippmann didn't seem too impressed with that.

Instead, he seemed grateful that he was able to protect Riana and Herriot.

"Good job."

"You too."

Despite the fact that we were reunited after quite some time, that was the extent of the conversation between Kliffman and me.

But with this guy, it's always been that way.

There wasn't much conversation.

It's always felt like this is good enough.

It's pretty amazing that it's still there.

I walked around the garrison and met people.

And then I realized something.

"Reinhard....... Ludwig, have you....... haven't you seen them?"

Ludwig was nowhere to be found.

"No....... I didn't see it."

"I see......."

Scarlett shook her head in despair.

Immortal's rampage means that Christina is very likely dead.

And Ludwig was moving with Christina.

But I saw Ludwig in the deepest part of the battlefield.

I noticed that it was moving in a different direction than the immortal.

Christina would be dead.

Anna and Louis don't know what happened.

Ludwig may have joined them after the battle.

But it's also likely dead.

I figured that since I was fighting in the most dangerous place, I should have a good chance of dying.

How could Ludwig have died in such vain?

I couldn't have any confidence in that.

No matter how much time has passed since then, I've never heard of anyone finding Ludwig, or even seeing him.
