After the mysterious ghostly woman leaves.

Bertus wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.

"What a mistake I made.

A cold sweat ran down Bertus's spine at the unimaginable rudeness that had crossed the line of decency.

Bertus had never seen or heard of the act of spitting tea into someone's face, nor had he ever imagined it.

The behavior was rude, crossing the line.

The other person seemed puzzled, but not angry.

It was a ridiculous answer.

His hands were shaking excessively, and I wondered why someone who didn't know who he was would be so nervous.

Alcoholism out of nowhere.

The answer was not at all in keeping with his seemingly noble demeanor.

The outfit was plain and not very upscale. I couldn't tell what was in the large trunk, but it didn't look like a luxury item.

Technically, she'd be a well-bred peasant girl.

Her features include shiny silver hair and delicate, almost painterly features. She wears heavy makeup, but it doesn't feel out of place.

He was a strange man in many ways.

From a distance, I could hear the commotion, and even as I walked, I could hear the angry voice.

-Huh, so you're a hand-wringing asshole?

-Are you there?

That doesn't sound like the kind of thing you'd expect a well-bred young lady to say.

-delay

"I, Your Majesty......."

"Uh, sit down."

Bertus froze, looking at the man before him and the two other men he'd brought with him.

They knelt before Bertus, not in chairs, but in front of him, even though he hadn't said anything. Bertus looked at the three kneeling before him, legs crossed and arms folded.

"What the hell is wrong with you?"

"Sin, I'm sorry!"

"Am I not understanding you correctly when you say that your goal is to ensure the safe operation of the horsepower trains and their respective stations, and yet you want to create a sense of urgency among the citizens?"

"I'm sorry, Your Majesty!"

The man who was about to swing his hand in frustration at a ghostly lady.

These three are not just troops, but vassals of Bertus.

In other words, the knights of the Duke of Salerian.

Bertus smirked.

"How much did you get?"

"Yes?"

"You're lucky it didn't happen. If you'd actually laid a hand on her, I'd be rolling around on the floor for a week, being told by the head of security that I'd been beating up citizens, and my half-brother would be doing nothing but watching me self-destruct. Too bad. It's a good thing she was bad enough to block your slap with one hand, huh? It's a good thing she didn't make my week of hard work go to waste, huh?"

"Sin, I'm sorry. God had a short fuse."

"Oh, how much did you get paid, I don't get it, why are you doing this crazy shit unless you got paid by Charlotte. Tell me, how much did you get paid by my half-brother?"

The three knights of the Duchy of Salerian grimaced at Bertus's evil stone joke.

Bertus' demeanor now was subtly reminiscent of Reinhardt's.

"Kill me, Your Majesty!"

Bertus had no intention of killing the three, though his judgment was warped.

Knights are somewhat above the law the moment they become privileged, especially those from families close to power.

So some people think that their privilege comes from them. So they can be overly ignorant and arrogant.

The knights of the Duke of Salerian are not the only ones.

The guards are just a few words away, and they're not held accountable for killing people, so they think it's okay to kill a few citizens.

It was a bit, well, seriously stupid to try to handcuff a citizen in public.

"If you try to ruin my week like this again, it's going to be fun."

Bertus said with a murderous look on his face, and then bit them.

There's no point in being competent if you're too short with your thoughts.

If they like stabbing, send them to a place where they can stab a lot.

Bertus has already decided which change to send the three of them to.

It's one thing to punch a shoplifter, but it's quite another to punch a citizen who tries to stop the situation.

Bertus didn't see it, but he heard the silver-haired lady grab the knight's wrist.

He didn't look like he had any power.

Bertus knew of a few out-of-standard cases, of course, where size and physical strength were not necessarily proportional.

What's he doing.

For the first time in his life, Bertus was very curious about the identity of the person who had spit tea in his face.

'I'm sure I've seen this before.......'

And somehow it felt familiar.

It's not a face, or an expression, or anything like that.

-Huh, so you're a hand-wringing asshole?

-Are you there?

Somehow.

That sounds familiar.

But the impression of the silver-haired woman was so strong that Bertus couldn't think of anyone else.

I think it was kind of cute how he was so flustered and fidgety at the sight of himself.

'......It wouldn't hurt for you to know.'

Also, he seemed to know who I was even though I hadn't told him. Of course, it's not like I didn't recognize the face, so it wasn't particularly strange.

Who.

What's he doing.

Bertus is disturbed by this sudden turn of events.



* * *



It was bad enough that I'd run into Bertus by some stupid coincidence. But it was even worse when I realized that if I'd just let the kids get beat up, nothing would have happened.

This.

It was a concept, but now that I'm living it, I feel like I've become this person.

No, but it's not like we're beating kids like dogs, is it?

...... may be true, but it's a bit glossed over by the time I say it.

Never mind.

There's no way Bertus would come to a cross-dressing contest. I thought he was supposed to be working on something important, not the Temple Festival, so he wouldn't be able to step foot in the Temple.

My steps were getting heavier and heavier as I got closer to the temple.

Real.......

I really don't want to go.......

Still, you have to go.

This is all for my own good.

No choice but to go.......

The trunk was heavy, too, as if it were dragging a load of iron.

One thing I did decide to do.

If you go off on a tangent like that, you might get into trouble.

First of all, whatever happens, just suck it up. If you don't, it could be worse.

"Why would I......."

Kono Lint stared blankly into space with unfocused eyes. She was now wearing the women's dress the organizers had provided.

Konorint wanted to cut out his own tongue for talking nonsense.

"The pageant, I hear it's today?

"Well.

Heinrich von Schwarz, Kaier Bioden, Erich de Lapaeri, and Kono Lindt.

The four of them walked around together throughout the festival, enjoying themselves.

"They're taking applications for that until this evening.

I only brought it up because I had the nefarious idea that it wouldn't be me.

'The guy who lost at rock-paper-scissors is out. How about that.'

Boys will sometimes bet their lives on strange bets.

To be more precise, we go on futile adventures to see the ugliness of others.

"......What? Why would you leave something like that? Are you crazy?

"Why, it's fun, right?

How embarrassing it will be.

Watching each other do things you'd never want to do in front of a bunch of people. Seeing the shame on their faces.

A lifetime of teasing.

There's no reason not to. Unsurprisingly, it was met with mixed reviews.

Until Kono Lint said this, it certainly was.

"It's not just me, right?

There are four candidates. So the probability is one in four.

It's a gamble you can't afford not to take.

Before rationality prevailed, Conor Lindt preached.

"If you don't pay, you're out!

The result is.

"......."

It's all explained by the fact that Kono Lint is now in the waiting room at the back of the great hall where the pageant is being held.

To be me is to be someone, and that was Conor Lindt.

It's equal odds, but strangely enough, it often takes one to go first, and Kono Lint was that one.

"Asshole, will you shut up?"

"Oh, okay......."

"Look at your face. What's wrong with your skin? You don't even wear makeup. Bam."

Liana de Granz was painting Kono Lint's face.

Riana, who usually treats herself like a cow, has the honor of having Duchess Young-ae do her makeup with her own hands.

Normally I'd be thrilled and my heart would be racing, but Kono Lint was just dying in real time.

"What, a cross-dressing contest?

"Do you guys have a hobby like that?

"Penalty?

"Oh, him?

'Hmph. Ugh. Oh, yeah. That's funny! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Makeover? Yeah. I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it! Where are you? Is it today?

I have no intention of putting on makeup, but friends, after all, are very supportive of those who are caught in the middle of a bad situation.

They go to her because they know she's the only one supporting Ellen and Cliff on the Mr. and Mrs. Temple issue.

As if on cue, when Kono Lint decided to participate in the cross-dressing contest, he managed to get Riana, who was usually a hard-to-reach person, to talk to him.

As if that weren't enough fun, Riana personally applied Kono Lint's makeup and picked out her outfit in the back waiting room where the pageant was taking place.

Of course, Riana didn't lend her clothes.

Dressed in one of the many women's outfits provided by the organizers, Riana fumbled around, trying on makeup and even a wig.

After a long pause, Riana clicked her tongue.

"What?"

"What."

"No matter what I do, it's just funny."

"......."

Riana giggled at the sight of Lint's face, as if it was too ridiculous to be true no matter how hard she tried.

A similar scene was unfolding around me. The convention isn't that big, so the waiting room is just a giant hall at the back of a huge auditorium. Some people sighed heavily, while others, like myself, had their makeup applied.

Usually, it's a bad look.

Some were fiddling with themselves in the mirror, and others were harder to see.

And there was this giant, giant humanoid chariot standing there, wearing the largest dress possible, but it looked like a short skirt.

It was even worse to watch him be ashamed of himself.

This is hell.

Kono Lint wondered who was worse, the demons of hell or the spectators who came to laugh at them.

Since the number of non-participants was limited to one person to help with makeup and outfits like Riana's, it was a good thing that she was the only one who could laugh at this.

His mouth is the problem.

There's no point in wallowing in self-pity.

Entry number 1.

Kono Lint wore a sign with his number on his chest.

It's even number one.

You said the entry numbers are randomized, not in order of application.

The last person to sign up must bat first.

It made me want to die even more.

"Why weren't you born prettier?"

"Why is that my fault....... Why should I be born pretty....... I'm a man......."

"Yeah? But he wasn't exactly handsome."

"Help me......."

Riana was applying her makeup and giggling about what was so funny.

Who's to blame?

You can only blame yourself for creating this hell.

In the midst of all that hell of looking at each other and holding back laughter, in the slightly rowdy waiting room while preparing for the competition.

Kono Lint saw someone sitting somewhere in a corner, among a group of people who looked like him.

It was a man in a robe.

Apparently, it was a participant.

I couldn't get a good look at her because she had her hood pulled down, but I could see that she had silver hair, a fine jawline, and shiny pink lips.

Even when I pretend, it's not the same.

Someone approached the person in the corner, not talking to anyone, just sitting there.

It was someone who appeared to be an organizer.

I couldn't hear the conversation because it was so far away, but he seemed to be saying something, and then he nodded in understanding and took off his hood.

For a moment, Conor Lindt was speechless.

It was the same for the other participants who happened to be in his line of sight.

We seemed to be having a conversation in that state, and the organizer nodded in understanding.

"Where do you see that?"

Riana turned her gaze toward Kono Lint as well, and dropped the cosmetics she was holding when she realized he was looking away.

"......What, are women allowed to participate? No, that can't be right, can it?"

Riana mumbled something to herself.

Even though I knew it wasn't true, I couldn't help but say it.

Girl.

No, not a girl, but a girl nonetheless.

When the girl was done talking to the organizers, she put her hood back on.

"That's a man?"

Riana asked, looking back at Kono Lint with a puzzled expression. Though her face was no longer visible,

"Well, even if you ask me about it......."

The two of them, and anyone else who saw the silver-haired contestant, were stumped.

Kono Lint even thought that the girl(?) seemed to make eye contact with him before she put on her hood.

I'm pretty sure I saw the hooded girl's face turn bright red.

'No way.......'

Konorint felt something in that face, in that demeanor, in that glimpse of the girl, however fleeting.

"You're not in love with me, are you?

Kono Lint was on a strange tangent.

Entry number 40.

If nothing else, Lint could see the number on the girl's chest.

Konorint could see that the girl kept mumbling something under her hood, using only the shape of her mouth.

-Why the fuck are they here....... Why the hell.......

Of course, I didn't realize that it was mostly gibberish.
