"Compliments."

"Well."

"Compliments."

"Well."

The same question was asked twice, and Ellen and I glared at each other fatally.

"You said you'd scold me if I didn't win, so I should praise you because I did!"

"I didn't say anything about compliments."

"Reinhardt's the best, you knew he was going to win!"

"...... is so full of platitudes that it doesn't even inspire me."

"Seo Woon Hae Ee Ee Ee!"

Ellen said she hadn't agreed to praise me, so she upped the ante. Eventually, the tournament was over, and I won, even though everyone saw it coming.

They won and lost fights, but they didn't have a grudge against each other. Ludwig was Ludwig, Scarlett was Scarlett, and they were unique.

Just like yesterday, all the members of Class A and B celebrated their victory together.

It is a festival, after all.

Both Harriet and Charlotte congratulated me on my win.

Ellen also stopped me on the way back to the dorm. We waited for everyone to go home, and then it was just the two of us.

"......."

Ellen was stumped.

I could give you some compliments, but do you think you can't handle me saying that?

He was a little red in the face.

"I....... Saying things like this. A little. It's weird....... I know."

"......what."

"I was proud of ......."

I felt like my head was going white from the sound of it.

"You, I was proud of you."

That's a little more than pleasing.

I was stumped.

No, not awesome, cool, or proud, which is a weird word!

"Are you my mom?"

At my words, Ellen's face turned fat again. You act like you've been raising me like a baby.

You know I fed you more than enough to eat.

"I taught you."

This kid, who was hopeless, ended up winning a tournament after I taught him for a year! He felt the same way!

"So you're the good guy after all?"

"Yes."

Ellen nodded and smiled.

"You've been good to me."

With that smile and those words, I didn't know what else to say.

It was mostly Ellen who made me who I am today. Ellen looks at me and smiles dazzlingly.

"You've done a great job, Reinhard. Congratulations."

"......."

In the end, even if it was all thanks to Ellen, I was the one who persisted in trying to learn swordsmanship by bullying her to the point of exhaustion.

There were a lot of coincidences and cheats, but I was the one who was willing to learn the hard way, swinging my sword, bumping and falling.

Not all of my power has come from hard work, but I can't say it hasn't been there.

That's why Ellen is telling me about all the hard work.

"What....... Thanks."

You whine for praise, but when you get it, you don't deserve it.......

Right.

Uh.

I even got a compliment from Ellen.

I don't think anyone disliked my win, and Ludwig and Scarlett seem to like me more, so it's a good result.

By the way.

My shoulders are getting heavier and heavier, and my stomach is rumbling like it's on fire.

This is due to the side effects of enchantments. In fact, I had to use enchantments for the entire third set to overwhelm Ludwig, and it was physically exhausting.

You're right, it's unreasonable.

I was dizzy, but not to the point of passing out or coughing up blood.

However, I don't think it's just about disenchantment again.

I'd like to get drunk on the joy of winning and forget about it for a while, but I can't forget until I try.

Today is Tuesday.

Tomorrow is Wednesday.

"ah......."

Pageantry.

It was coming up tomorrow.

Is this what it's like to cry and eat mustard.

My moodiness seemed to get worse, not better.

In the end, I gave up on qualifying for the Unlimited tournament because it was clear I wouldn't be in shape to do anything after the Women's event.

Tuesday night.

Hogwarts House.

Herriot de Saint-Ouen was experimenting in a safe room in the basement of his mansion. It's a very large laboratory, with enough crystallization, protection, and soundproofing magic to allow him to experiment with higher level destructive magic.

Outdoor labs are not out of the question, but since destructive magic is often accompanied by binge drinking, it's best to do it in a controlled environment.

It's a festival, and you can't do this experiment outside.

Inside the safe room, Herriot was experimenting with something, and outside, beyond the security window, the entire Magical Research Society was watching.

-Woof

A stream of flame shot from Herriot's fingertips and landed in a pile on the opposite wall.

-Bang!

Another explosion followed, this time a streak of flame that enveloped Herriot from the top of his head to his shoulders.

Lesser destructive magic called Firebolt.

In an instant, five fireballs form and hit all of them.

-Quack, quack, quack!

It was very fast, with almost no casting.

Herriot's wrists and forearms were streaked with blue energy lines.

"Success!"

"That's it......!"

"Wow, I can't believe this is actually happening......."

Herriot went on to demonstrate a number of sub-destructive spells, including Lightning Bolt, and even casting fireballs.

These are all spells that Herriot has mastered. And even if you don't specialize in destructive magic, you can still do this.

Except different.

You're casting unusually fast, and even multicasting.

When Herriot emerged from the safe room, all the members of the Magical Research Society's eyes lit up when they saw her.

"That's it! Are we done?"

At Christina's words, Harriet smiled wearily.

"Somewhat, but I think it needs some work."

"Junior, you're a genius!"

Redina jumped for joy like it was her job.

"There's no way this is going to be......."

Louis Ancton mumbled something incoherent. Harriet laughed at the dumbfounded Louis Ankton.

"What if it's something you made and you panic?"

"No....... It's just words, and I don't think it's exactly connected to the theory......."

Louis Ankton was even more stunned to see the spectacle he had envisioned come to life.

"This, I think, is a magic system that no one but you can use, like this....... There's no way other wizards can do it. I mean, I know it makes sense, but I never thought it was possible."

In other words, Herriot was using the tools that Louis had created too perfectly. The implication is that Louis Anckton was a genius for creating something like this in such a short time, but only Herriot was a better genius for using it.

"Really? Then I'm good."

On Herriot's right arm, beneath the cuff, blue, pictorial things hummed and glowed, then faded.

"Ugh, Reinhardt won too."

Herriot sighed heavily, stretching to see if he was tired.

"I should do something."

Unlimited tournaments are at a different level than Grade 1 tournaments.

Even though he didn't know who would win, he didn't think he was going to do badly.

The members of the Magical Research Society knew what Herriot could do, so they didn't think it was arrogant confidence.

An annoying human being who keeps interrupting and picking up bullshit.

Olivia Ranze.

She braced herself, determined to break his arrogant snout.

He's so focused on Ellen that he has no idea he's going to get hit in the wrong place.

Wednesday.

Herriot wasn't in the dorm because he was busy, and the girls competing in the Miss & Mr. Temple pageant weren't there because they wanted to start preparing properly.

In other words, everyone I know is busy with their own shit.

And.

I'm not idle either.

"Reinhard, we're going to watch the parade, do you want to come?"

For some reason, I've gotten to know them better since the tournament, the Ganodab brothers and Heinrich.

Kono Lindt looked at me and waved.

"No, I'm taking a break."

"Oh....... Did you push yourself a little too hard yesterday?"

"......."

It's true that it's overwhelming, and it's true that my body needs a break, but I can't take a break today.

Crossdressing contest....... I gotta go.......

With a 5 hp boost, this might just be the most important event of the festival.......

Right now my horsepower is 14.2, but if I go up 5, it will be 19.2.

Just 0.8 more points here and the Magic Dominance talent will bloom.

So I can't bring myself to give up.

In the end, it was a good situation for me to be in, where my best friends weren't asking me to go somewhere today.

No matter what I do, no one is going to care where everyone else is, so I can go to a cross-dressing convention and come back and no one is going to ask me where I've been.

You sneak out of your dorm to go to a cross-dressing convention and come back.

I'm such an asshole!

Yeah....... You're right, I am a madman who has sold his soul and dignity for events and challenges, but I crossed a river of no return when I turned into a woman and confessed to Kono Lint.

It's my karma.

If I stayed still, I'd get halfway there, but the asshole got wind of the weirdness and has been giving me this shit ever since.

If you hadn't done that, I might have given you a different festive event.

It's my fault, it's my fault, it's my big fault.



* * *



The pageant is held at night.

Of course, it's not going to be in a huge space like a main stadium, but in some kind of indoor auditorium in a regular classroom, but we already know the location.

It's lunchtime.

The competition starts at 6pm.

But I had to start preparing now: I had a dress that I could put on and take off by myself, but I couldn't do my own makeup.

I'm going to head out of the temple, get my makeup done by Elise, and return with my clothes.

And of course, I'm going out and back with a hood on.

Luckily, it's a festive time of year, so crowd control, including ID checks, is lax at the Temple Gate.

Once you're all set up outside the temple, you can kill some time in a secluded spot and then sneak in when it's time for the contest to start.

There's no point in wandering around in the temple.

I don't know why anyone would want to consider the number of cases of something like this in a covert operation.

In practice.

Oh my god, this makes me a million times more nervous than the tournament!

What if they recognize me? What if someone sees me? What if the moderator suddenly says, "Reinhardt!"?

Shouldn't we just go out? It's magic anyway, and if we keep doing it, we'll climb. Isn't it too much of a gamble? Do we really need to control magic? There are spirits?

Okay, no need to get greedy here, right?

Despite the mess in my head, I was now walking out of the dorm with a half-souled look on my face.

The streets were crowded with people during the festival. But wherever they were going, I couldn't be bothered.

I felt like my brain was going to split in two as I was simultaneously thinking about giving up on the pageant and trying to figure out what facial expression would make me look less like Reinhardt.

No, the brain is supposed to be left-brained and right-brained.

My mind was grinding away in real time, forgetting the obvious.

I don't know what the hell I'm doing, and it's broad daylight.

Elise was still running the store. Though it still didn't seem to be working.

But today, they closed the store and told me to wait at home.

A residential neighborhood near the Aligarh shopping district.

I knocked on the subterranean door and Elise answered it.

"Welcome, degradation."

"Uh."

She'd already gotten ready, and her room was clean and lined with makeup.

Eleris studied my complexion and shook her head.

"The tournament is at....... Didn't work out?"

"No, I won."

"But why does your face look like....... Ah."

Eleris nodded, the corners of her mouth twitching slightly, as if she'd forgotten why I couldn't help but look grim at the news of our victory.

"......But good job, Jae. That's some impressive growth."

"Thanks......."

After saying something I don't know if it was a compliment or a consolation, Elise sat me down in a chair.

"That....... Do you want to get started right away?"

"......I'm going to do it anyway, what's the point in dragging my feet?"

They both looked devastated.

I started by washing my face and using Sarkhegar's Ring to change my face into the shape I had previously molded.

It's a subtle difference, but add some makeup to it, change your expression, and you look like a completely different person.

The reflective shield she summoned reflected a face that had been slightly reshaped, but was still pale and silver-haired.

"......Why? Oh, no. No. Don't say anything."

It's weird to think about, I just changed a little bit, no makeup, and this is it!

It's like drawing a girl and calling her a boy!

"......Let's get started."

"......."

This is the beginning of a hellish time.

It's a day anyway.

In a day or so, you won't have to do this horrible thing anymore.

No matter how hellish things get in the world, you'll always remember it as the way it was. You can twist a chicken's head off, but the dawn will still come. Time marches on, the world turns upside down, and the pageant ends today!

No matter how slowly time passes, tomorrow will come, and when it does, I'll be able to say goodbye to this filthy mess, and all I'll have left is a bunch of fake hp and achievement points!

When you're done, you'll think, "Oh, I'm so glad I did that," and you'll swallow your shame and be proud of yourself for doing it!

I make excuses for myself to self-justify.

a.......

I think I'm going to level up my self-suggestion.
