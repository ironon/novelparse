The day I saw an immortal being created with my own eyes.

Bertus said.

Someone has to be responsible for all of this.

Afterward, for a while, Bertus and I talked.

"I'm not just talking about who's responsible for Gate.

"So, what responsibilities?

'And the responsibility of the Demon War.

It all started with the Demon War, so if we're going to talk about accountability, we should start there.

Bertus said.

In that story, I couldn't help but recognize the responsibility and who Bertus was talking about.

If the real cause of the Gate debacle was the Demon War, then who is responsible for the Demon War?

That would be humanity.

But humanity as a whole is paying the price, not being held accountable.

Someone has to take full responsibility.

Hence, humanity, the beginning of everything and the source of everything.

The imperial family of Gradias, who decided the war.

The imperial family must be held accountable, Bertus said.

"Did you cause the Great Demon War?

Of course, after the war, it wasn't up to Bertus to decide.

And that war, after all, was caused by the dictates of the Imperial House of Gradias.

While the Empire may have started the war, it was always going to happen eventually, and if it wasn't a war that anyone wanted, no one, not even the Empire, would have been able to mobilize such a large force in the first place.

"Remember when I used to say that?

"......what?

"The one that said everyone below me is the same.

Yes.

I said something like that.

"But I'm not here because I actually did something, and it's not like I don't take credit for that.

'.......'

'Just as you are a demon because you are an Archdemon, so I am because I am the Emperor's son.'

Yes, Bertus certainly said he was above everyone, but he didn't say he was above everyone because he was great.

It's inherited.

Wise or incompetent, those in the imperial family are granted power.

It's not a matter of right or wrong, it's just the way it is.

"If you're born with the glory that you don't deserve, you're born with the responsibility that you don't deserve.

'.......'

"If I take the glory and the power, but not the responsibility, isn't that kind of ridiculous and lame?

If you're going to deny responsibility, you shouldn't have inherited power and glory in the first place. Neither comes from you.

"Maybe it's time to take responsibility, because really, it's not like I didn't play a role in all of this.

If you've been treated with honor since birth, it's not because you're great, it's because it's inherited.

Therefore, you are also responsible for everything that happens in the Demon War that has nothing to do with you.

If you're going to inherit power, you should also inherit responsibility.

In front of Bertus' solemn expression, I was speechless.

If you've been honored for something you didn't do, you have to take responsibility for it.

That's for me, not Bertus.

All the things I have because I created this world.

So shouldn't I be responsible for what happens in this world?

Not Bertus.

At the end of the day, Bertus is a victim of me.

Because it doesn't change the fact that I'm the perpetrator of all of this.

"You don't have to make that asshole face.

I wonder what kind of face I was making.

However, Bertus said.

"Is it harder to put the world down, or harder to swallow the world. Do we really need to compare?

What Bertus needs to do is difficult.

So, is what I need to do easy?

"It's funny to say this, but just like I take responsibility for myself, you take responsibility for yourself.

Yes.

He's right.

Letting go of the world.

Digesting the world.

Both will be challenging, but the latter will be harder.

There's a way that Bertus is responsible, and there's a way that I'm responsible.

Bertus is not giving me the world.

You're leaving the world to me.

If I can clean up the mess the Emperor has made, the world will be mine, and I will survive.

But if I fail, the world may not be destroyed, but everything I have and myself will be.

"I think you should be angry.

Bertus chuckled, as if he didn't understand the strange look I was giving him.

"That's weird.

Then, Bertus laughed.

Like you can't stand it without laughing.

I, for one, could not laugh in Bertus' presence.

-Grrrrrr!

The battlefield once again.

I was wielding a sword in the midst of an inferno of fire, ice, and thunderbolts.

Do not use Tiamata and Alsbringer.

-Kyaaaaah!

The mere sight of the dimorphic liquid monster charging at me vaporized it with flames.

Fireworks.

On the battlefield, a lot of people get mixed up.

So they don't think everything that happens is coming from me.

You pick up a broken spear of unknown origin and hurl it into the enemy lines.

-Quizik!

A spear pierces the head of a behemoth that has been rampaging across the battlefield, trampling soldiers.

-Kwow!

But it doesn't fall down.

I can't count the number of times I've had to use a water station that looked like a bunch of differently shaped, eaten monster heads.

Not as much as Ellen, though.

I've killed more monsters than I can count.

I fly across the battlefield, lunging at any monster that hasn't fallen, punching it in the face.

-Bam!

It's not the sound of a fist.

Technically, it's the sound of an energetic shockwave fired at the moment of fist contact.

In the flesh of the behemoth, half of it blown away in an instant, I pass a group of soldiers looking up at me in disbelief.

There's a good thing about immortals.

If you're wearing an armored helmet, you're probably one of the Immortals.

When an unknown soldier advances, slaughtering monsters, the soldiers think it's the hidden power of the empire, not the devil himself.

So, it's better to wear a helmet than to move around with a different face.

Just as the soldiers look at me in awe but don't suspect me, the immortals don't suspect me.

Amidst the bombast and roar of battle.

In the distance, the trajectory of the Voidblade slices through the monsters as it advances.

I, too, ran toward the warp gate as part of the battle.

I'm not the only one.

Immortals also include wizards.

Among the golden glow that bathes the battlefield, healing and blessing the wounded, are the shots of Olivia Ranze.

And.

-Flash!

Some of the light flying toward the city from the rear of the battlefield was coming from Herriot.

-Currrrr!

Among the thunderbolts raining down from the sky were some summoned by Riana.

How to be held accountable.

Just as you can't take all the responsibility for your life, there are many ways to take responsibility.

Is this the right way to be accountable?

But I don't want to be responsible for death.

I am responsible or accountable in some other way.

He swung his weapon as if possessed.

Before reaching Wallen's next large city, Luboten, the Allies kept their distance.

Until all other small and medium-sized cities' warp gates have been handled by Immortals.

With Immortal's mission accomplished, the Allies advanced on Luboten.

It was definitely more intense than the Battle of Wall Run, and the battle itself took longer.

But in the end, it was still less of a sacrifice than Serandia.

The look on the faces of the Allies as they saw Luboten reduced to ashes was a little different from the look on their faces after the successful capture of Serandia.

It's a less damaging victory, but that's not because I'm sad.

Now we have one more thing to do.

Now, the end is really coming.

Everyone knew it, and there was a sense of resignation rather than triumph on everyone's faces.

Knowing that the moment they had hoped and prayed for was just around the corner, the Allies cleared the battlefield in a mood of sober reflection rather than triumphant celebration.

It's up to the Allies to clean up the battlefield.

We're back in Lazak.

Riana looks at me and shrugs.

"But why did we have to fight it ourselves?"

"It's better than nothing."

"Well....... That's not exactly wrong."

At my words, Riana nodded with a pensive expression.

I'd rather be fighting than watching the battle from afar. I could use Dreadfind's Ring to transform and fight as one of the Allied soldiers, but it would be weird to have a very powerful soldier whose identity is unknown, so I didn't.

However, since the advent of Immortals, it's not unusual for the Alliance to have very powerful allies whose identities are unknown.

So, I thought I'd just throw on a helmet and head into battle. I didn't want to be too obvious with my Tiamata and Alsbringer.

I was going to go by myself, but then she heard me and said she'd go too.

And then Olivia and Riana came along.

It's easier for someone like Olivia, who can fight on the battlefield in a helmet or robe, and the Crusaders are ours.

Plus, even Elise and Lucinil helped with the battle.

That's not a significant majority, but it's better than nothing.

It can't hurt to have the monsters die a little faster.

I don't know if it makes sense to anonymously insert yourself into a battle you're going to win anyway.

It's a battle won, but not without death.

Someone would have been hurt, someone would have been killed.

I don't think I killed the most monsters in today's battle, but Riana and Herriot did.

Herriot stood still in the clearing in front of Razak's castle in the night, staring down at the hillside.

You're bound to have a lot on your mind.

-profit! profit......! profit!

And Olivia was sitting on the rocky ledge in front of the castle, wincing as she stripped off her plate armor soaked in the blood of the monsters.

-Ah, that sucks!

-Bam!

Olivia scowls, dropping her armor.

I didn't take it off, I peeled it off.

"Now you're saying she's cute sometimes, am I crazy?"

Riana smirked as she watched Olivia sulk.

No, I don't think I'd call that cute.

In the distance, Olivia stares at me with an axe-eye.

-Reinhardt! Don't look at me, help me, you idiot! I can't even put this on myself!

"Okay."

Walking over to the squirming Olivia, I untied the knots in her armor.

"So you're not wearing full body armor like me?"

"Rowen told me to wear it, but I didn't give a shit, so I forced myself to wear it."

Apparently, he visited Crusader Captain Rowen just before the battle began.

"It's consecrated armor, so it works. Do you think paladins are stupid enough to wear this?"

Paladins don't wear armor for nothing, Olivia explained with a heavy sigh, because they can bless and, in some cases, enhance the physical body.

Just as I was disguised as a soldier, Olivia was disguised as a paladin, so I had no choice but to wear plate.

With Olivia's platinum hair tangled up, I had to say it was a ghostly sight.

This is unavoidable if you're going to be in melee combat.

Liana and Harriet were looking a little tired, but still fluffy.

Eventually, I stripped Olivia of her armor and she was down to her underwear.

You're wearing armor, so you're going to be light on the inside.

"......."

"......."

Well.

Uh.

That.......

"Either look at it properly, or don't look at it at all, you. It's more sinister."

Olivia shoots me a cold glare.

"Oh, I didn't see that....... No, I did, but that's not what I saw......!"

"And I smell blood now. Don't come near me."

"When you ask me to take off my armor!"

Come on, come on, come on!

"That was then, this is now."

But really, as Olivia said, it did smell like blood.

Olivia watched Harriet's back as she looked down the hill in the distance with envy, then rose from her seat.

"When I'm reborn, I'll learn magic too....... It sucks....... Mr. Lee......."

Olivia stumbled into the castle, leaving her armor where it lay.

I could see Charlotte coming out, too scared for Olivia to enter.

"I hear the battle went well."

Our regent is technically a fighter, but Charlotte's job is not to be on the battlefield, so she wore the most modest dress possible.

"What....... Fortunately."

We participated, but in the end, the biggest roles were played by Titans and Immortals.

Charlotte crossed her arms and took a deep breath.

"Now....... Diane."

"Right."

I couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat when he said that.

Now we can really see the end in sight.

All the other places were also cleaned up by Immortal.

Regeln Capital Diane.

Now for the really last one.

Only the final push remains.

All of us were left to ponder.
