"Mr. Daibun, where did your sister go?"

"Sister, I don't think she'll be back until tomorrow or the day after, she had to go somewhere."

"I see."

"What about your sister?"

"No, I just haven't seen you since yesterday."

Adriana chatted in passing as she carried a basket of laundry and hung it on the clothesline outside. Other members of the club, some of whom were also working, stood beside Adriana as she washed, some of whom were walking through the already crisp drying laundry.

I spent a few months in the Rotary Club.

Adriana had gotten used to life here.

Everyone in the club now looked like a human being.

Of course, by the time Adriana came to live here, the Rotary Club's income was already stabilized, but there were still many people who hadn't gotten out of the rut that they'd been living in.

But a lot has changed since Adriana's arrival.

The most important thing was hygiene.

The hygiene of the captain, who was supposed to be an example to everyone, was extremely poor, and there were quite a few people in the club who were just as bad.

Once Adriana gave Loyar a thorough bath and checked his nails, it set the tone for the rest of the team to take charge of their own hygiene.

Everyone could not believe their eyes as they watched the fierce, vicious Irine wild dog turn into a pet dog in Adriana's presence.

Eventually, Adriana found herself in charge of the cleanliness, janitorial, and sanitation of the Rotary Club's headquarters.

Most of all, I realized that if I left Adriana alone without a boss, she would run around looking for something to do, and we would all do things like cleaning because there was nothing else to do.

Eventually, Adriana became something of an energizer bunny for the older members of the Rotary Club, who were pretty much living the life.

It makes you think that it's not disgusting to see a kid moving around trying to do one more thing, but as an adult, he's drunk and spread out.

So, after a night of booze-fueled revelry, sleeping in the hall or vomiting on the floor was a thing of the past, even if Adriana didn't say anything about it.

If we did drink, we would have a couple of drinks in moderation, and then when it was time for Adriana to go to bed, we would all quietly retire to my room and go to sleep.

He said, "Why be loud when he's sleeping?

Without realizing it, Adriana had become like a daughter to the entire Rotary Club.

During these months, Adriana also learned about some of the quirks of Rotary clubs.

Loyar usually spent most of his days lying on a couch in a reception room-like area on the top floor of the club's headquarters, or going for walks with Adriana.

Literally, I was just sitting there like a dog guarding the house.

The Rotary Club's business is also managed by subordinates, and Loyar doesn't know much about the specifics of what's going on or how much money is coming in.

In fact, it was slowly turning into a situation where I would talk to Adriana about things that needed approval and she would pass it on to Loyar.

And no matter what he was told, Loyar would just tell him to get on with it.

One day, Adriana asked Daibun. What does your sister do?

When asked, Daibun said that his sister had a lot of work to do when they lived under the bridge.

Typically, they said they would defend their club members in fights with other groups of beggars, or if a club member got beaten up somewhere, they would go and retaliate.

He was indispensable when they were a group of beggars under the bridge, Daibun told Adriana, even finding money from somewhere.

It's just that right now, the situation has unfolded and there's nothing for Loyar to do.

Adriana was grateful for that, because she couldn't think of anything better than to be free of fighting.

And even though it seemed a little rough, it was pretty interesting to hear that my sister was so good at fighting.

No one in the club hadn't seen Loyar in a fight, and many had even gotten beaten up.

Everyone was literally drooling over her fighting skills.

Anyway, as far as Adriana knew, Loyar used to be a very important part of the club, but now that things are better, he's just lying around with nothing to do.

Nevertheless.

Once a month or so, Loyar would be gone for a few days.

We only knew that he was going out of town for some reason, but he would suddenly disappear somewhere, only to return a few days later.

The club members were just going along with it like it was a given.

Now that I don't have to fight anymore, I wonder what she's up to.

Adriana was curious about that, but Loyar just said he had to run errands and didn't elaborate.

So I just assumed that it was something that Adriana didn't know much about.

It was one of those days.

Murders in the imperial court, dark clouds over the world. There was also the surprising news that Ellen, Reinhardt, and Olivia had become owners of a holy relic, but Reinhardt didn't come to the Rotary Club very often, so we didn't have time to talk about it.

So Adriana was just another day at the club's headquarters, on the ecliptic, but a little out of this world.

It was an afternoon like any other.

Adriana was cleaning the reception area on the top floor of the club. Adriana was working hard to clean up the long strands of white hair that had fallen on the couch.

It's a head of hair, but with the feeling of clearing away an animal's fur.

In the distance, Adriana could see a group of people approaching the club.

It's not like the club doesn't get outsiders, but it was a little weird.

And at the top of the list was a face Adriana recognized.

Ellen Artorius, sister of the warrior Ragan Artorius and holder of the Holy Ramen, was walking toward the club's headquarters at the head of the line of soldiers.

The recent revelations were startling, but Adriana had a stronger image of Ellen as Reinhardt's friend.

I've also been told that there have been quite a few cases of people coming to the club and getting beaten up by their sister.

Everyone in the club used to be tongue-in-cheek about how extraordinary it was that Ellen was actually the hero's sister.

Even though Adriana is now the club's little girl, Ellen knows everyone in the club, and people seem to like her.

But Ellen, looking as grave as she felt, was approaching the club at the head of a group of heavily armed soldiers.

"What is......?"

With a sense that something ominous is about to happen, the club members outside approach Ellen.

Contrary to her ominous premonition, Ellen began to have some conversations with the club members, and there was no indication that violence would be used.

However, one by one, the soldiers approach Ellen and the other club members and start talking to them.

The content was not heard.

What's going on.

I was getting up to leave when I realized I needed to get out too.

"Adriana."

As if on cue, Daibun rushed over and grabbed Adriana's arm.

"Da, Mr. Daibun?"

"Follow me."

Daibun began to drag Adriana down the stairs.

"Outside....... What's going on?"

"I'm not sure. But I think something's up."

Daibun quickly led Adriana down the stairs, as if there was something to be done before the soldiers entered the club's headquarters.

You've arrived at the club's basement.

When they reached the area where the groceries and other unsold inventory from the horse-train shop were stacked, Daibun pushed Adriana back against the wall and watched.

"Adriana, don't ask, don't tell, just follow the path I show you."

"Yes....... Yes?"

"Under the bridge south of Bronzegate, where our club used to be, leads to the Ecliptic Underground Sewers."

Daibun's expression was so serious, Adriana couldn't even ask a question.

"If you go deep enough into that sewer, you'll find your sister."

"Is that you? Why are you there......."

"I can't explain the details. Adriana, you care about your sister, don't you?"

"Yeah? Yeah....... Uh, yeah."

Adriana is very grateful and appreciative of Loyar for making her feel so important, and she now considers him family.

What's not to like about someone who protects and cares for you unconditionally?

"Follow the sewers to find your sister, and tell her to never come back here."

"What....... What are you talking about....... I'm not sure......."

-Drupa!

But Daibun had already fiddled with the walls, opening a secret chamber hidden in the basement wall.

What the hell is this in the Rotary Club basement?

It's as if it was intentionally created so that someone could get away with it.

Adriana didn't know.

Daibun looks at Adriana with wide eyes. As if he doesn't have time to explain much.

"After you have told your sister, you must leave the sewer quickly. You must get out quickly. Do not stay with your sister after you deliver these words. Never."

-delay

-jerky

Upstairs, the dull thud of the door opening was already sounding ominous.

"Adriana, after you have spoken, you must part ways with your sister before nightfall."

Daibun grabbed both of Adriana's shoulders and spoke again, as if to remind her never to forget.



* * *



Adriana doesn't think she knows much about Rotary Clubs; she's just doing what she can on the spot, and she's just learning what Rotary really does.

But Adriana realized that she really didn't know anything.

I don't know why there's a secret passageway in the basement of the Rotary Club headquarters.

"Ha ha....... Ha ha......."

But Adriana was running.

Why did Ellen come to the Rotary Club headquarters with her soldiers, and what was she there to ask?

What is Loyaar doing in those underground sewers.

Why on earth would he tell Loyar this before nightfall and part ways.

Adriana knows nothing.

Adriana ran and ran and ran to do what Daibun desperately asked her to do, even though it might be dangerous for everyone.

The secret passage wasn't very long.

Adriana pushed up on the sewer lid-like exit and stepped out.

Instead of an ecliptic street, I saw a wooded forest.

It was an unobtrusive exit, so Adriana ran into the distant streets of the ecliptic.
