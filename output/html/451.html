            Episode 451





The Edina Archipelago is essentially a remote island nation outside of the regular warp gate system that covers the entire continent.

There are small warp gates connecting the islands of the archipelago, but they only connect island to island and do not reach the continent.

Due to the nature of gate events, where the bigger the gate, the bigger the monsters, the smaller the gate event was in other areas.

But that's only relative.

-croak

It can handle the familiar shape of the monster, which looks like a small dog.

-Kiriririk

However, there are some variants that have dozens of arms and dozens of eyeballs attached to each arm.

Not only are these creatures horrifying to look at, but the dozens of arms they have to kill everyone within their reach would send soldiers fleeing in a panic, let alone ordinary people.

It looks arbitrary.

When the inevitable monsters start pouring out of the warp gate, people, both soldiers and civilians, have no choice but to flee.

The area around the warp gate was quickly turned to rubble, and fire-breathing monsters set buildings ablaze. In an instant, Razak, the main port city of the Edina Archipelago, was filled with chaos and screams.

-Pooh! Pow!

"This is....... replace......!"

The succubus queen, Airi, gritted her teeth and shot the creatures with her cage, then looked out at the monsters still lining the streets, and growing in number.

There's no reason to have a weapon, so the cage she's holding now was the dead guard's weapon.

Being a mixed race of demons, Airi had seen her fair share of demons and beasts.

However, the monsters that appeared now resembled some of the demons and beasts that existed in the world, while others were anomalies that could hardly be considered life.

The guards had already lost their nerve with the monstrous creatures, whose very existence was terrifying.

Despite losing her horns, Airi had learned to fight, and the other succubi under her command were gritting their teeth to keep her sane, somehow managing to hold off the onslaught of monsters.

The president and staff of Angel Capital, including Airi, who started out as a bar and was accused of sucking people's blood with a hook.

They were the only ones remaining sane and holding their weapons as the guards fled.

Angel Capital, like a giant temple in Airi, has become a temporary refuge for those who have nowhere else to run.

People hid behind the succubi and watched as the pink-haired loan shark boss caged, beat, and even tore the monsters apart with his bare hands.

-Airi from.......

-Was that a good fight......?

-It's a monster.......

The crowd inside the entrance to Angel Capital stood frozen, watching as the guards stood at the entrance, shooting and killing any monsters that fled in fear.

Even with her horns removed, Airi's physical abilities are not comparable to those of a normal human.

In the midst of the catastrophe that was about to consume the Edina Archipelago, they found themselves defending their customers and long-term prey.

A sudden catastrophe.

-currrrrr

Airi watched, frozen, as the burning building collapsed, crushing the fleeing people under its rubble.

"What are the soldiers doing?"

Airi muttered nervously, but even she was getting tired of looking at the monsters.

The Edina Archipelago is an outlier among outliers.

Some of the most skilled or talented people leave for the continent with big dreams.

The people left on the island aren't necessarily ravenous, but you can't expect them to grit their teeth and defend themselves against a sudden catastrophe.

How many soldiers are there on this small archipelago, how many knights are there, how many of them are enchanted, and how many wizards are there.

Anyone who could be enchanted would be considered the best of the best in the archipelago at that moment, and if they were young enough to be enchanted, they would have gone to the continent with bigger dreams.

Airi doesn't know where it all started.

All they've heard from those who have fled is that monsters are coming out of the warp gate.

Is this happening only in this razak, only in the archipelago. Or an entire continent.

No one knows unless they hear it from the devil himself.

"Hmph!"

Airi breathed raggedly as she pierced the gills of a charging two-headed bear with her spear, then stabbed the other one in the skull with the longsword sheathed at her waist, killing it instantly.

"허억....... 허억......."

There's no telling how long the monsters will keep coming.

As she watched the corpses lining the streets, and more being added to the pile, Airi drew the bars from the desperate bear-like creature.

Hates humans.

It wished for the destruction of humans.

-Grrrrrr!

However, a large lizard that nearly filled the alleyway flicked its tail once, sending people flying.

I hate humans.

In the long run, I was hoping for the extinction of the human race.

I wonder if this is allowed to happen.

Not by war, not by anything, but by an inexplicable catastrophe.

Civilians, not soldiers, who have never known a fight in their lives.

Just like that, I can die a trashy death.

Even though she was making a living squeezing people, Airi couldn't help but realize that there were humans who deserved to be loved.

Some people spent their entire family fortune on overnight gambling tables, and others were playing with their own money, not borrowing from Capital to build their fleet.

I've had someone come in and say they couldn't pay back the money they borrowed, and they did.

But.

I've also seen people who really need money, but the amount they need is so insignificant.

I saw people who were too poor to be Airy's customers.

A boy begged his mother to lend him ten pieces of silver now because she was sick, and he would pay her back later when he was an adult.

I saw a group of little kids who were going out to play because their brother was starving at home.

Many sailors starved because they couldn't afford a meal.

I didn't think of it as compassion.

The insignificance is so insignificant, so insignificant.

I once dug into my pocket and lent him a few silver coins, with a playful remark that I'd pay him back later.

It was definitely there.

I've seen that insignificant amount of money that I forgot about as soon as I gave it, really pay off a few days later.

I once received a silver dollar that doubled in size as I knocked on the door of an angel capital with a huge smile on my face, thanking them for saving my life and saying that I would pay them back as an adult.

There was a time when that little guy was so cute, I couldn't help but hug him with all my might.

Thinking it shouldn't be this way with humans.

It's a small acknowledgment.

To me, it's a small price to pay for such a big deal.

No.

You never know when the world's perception of you as a money ghost and a bunch of money-crazed bitches will come back to bite you in the ass.

I think it's a public opinion business and a political business to prepare for that.

He started an interest-free loan program for starving children and families who lost their fathers in storms.

It's a loan, and since Airi has no intention of getting the money back, it's actually a donation. Lending money to people who can't pay it back is a donation, unless you're trying to hold their leash.

To the adults of Razak, Airi was a demon.

To them, Airi was an angel.

In keeping with the name Angel Capital, which she coined with malicious intent, Airi was a devil to some and an angel to others.

It was a red line that I drew because I couldn't stand the little struggles and insignificance.

Those kids, in the streets.

-Quack! Quack!

It was really dying a slow death.

With a short, sharp scream, it was being bitten, torn, and crushed.

"Ah....... ah......."

If you leave, everyone behind you dies, too.

I couldn't leave for the sake of my employees, the people in the shelters, and my children.

So Airi could only watch the tiny struggles of the dying with squinted eyes.

Airi felt like she was on the verge of tears once in her life.

When the demon castle falls and is taken in chains to the humans.

That one time when you felt all was lost.

And now.

Airi was once again feeling what it was like to be on the verge of tears as she watched humans, human children, not demons, die.

Monsters are pouring into the streets.

Some were small, like wild dogs, but others were clearly giant lizard-like creatures, stalking across the street.

Though the broken horns always brought bitterness to themselves.

For today.

I don't think I've ever felt more sorry for a broken horn than I do today.

If I had the power.

If only I had the power.

-No!

I wish I could have run to that little girl calling out to me as she ran down the street, protecting me from the giant lizard.

The boy who said he needed money for medicine for his mother one day.

You didn't have to look away.

No.

I can't turn away.

"Boss!"

"You can't go!"

Airi lost her temper and ran down the stairs toward the boy.

After the fall of the Demon World, Airi lived to destroy things.

However, the power you want to have to destroy something.

One of the rules of society.

Capital.

In this situation.

At a time when the very fabric of society is disintegrating.

In this situation, all the rules break down.

Capital, a power based on rules, cannot protect anything.

No amount of capital can overcome the violence in front of us.

Only in body.

Only by action.

It can destroy something or protect something.

Airi leapt to her feet and roughly grabbed the boy with her left arm as he ran down the street.

"Sis! Sis...... Hm, hm, hm!"

"I'll protect you....... I'll protect you......."

Holding the boy in her arms, Airi sees a giant lizard slithering toward her.

The cage Airi holds in her right hand is shorter than the creature's gills.

If you try to poke it, it will swallow you up.

It's too late to back down.

In the midst of destroying humanity, he protects a human being, a boy who is nothing, and is eaten by an unidentified monster.

This is.

I don't think that's what Valerie wants.

Cradling the floating boy in her arms, Airi aims her spear at the charging creature.

"Bali.

To your childhood friend who isn't here.

To the boy he recognized as his lord.

In the end, it doesn't help at all.

"I'm sorry.

Just as I was about to roll down the window with that thought.

-pot!

As if time had slowed down, Airi saw a girl with forked hair appear in front of her.

As if she had a glowing blue tattoo on her body, the girl who had suddenly appeared held out both hands in front of her.

-Bam!

-knowwhat!

The lizard slammed its face into the blue barrier and screeched and took a few steps back.

What's going on here.

A mysterious wizard appeared and saved him.

"Are you okay?"

Before she could answer the girl's question, Airi saw.

A human-shaped balier leaping from the sky.

-POOF!

And then he plunges Alsbringer, the sword of the War God, into the lizard's head.

-Currrrr!

Then, the jewel around Valier's neck glows red, and the lizard is engulfed in flames and burns.

"Val......?"

Airi, looked.



* * *



He's surprised to see Valerie in human form out of nowhere.

Airi couldn't help but be even more appalled.

-Kurrrrr! kurrrrr!

Suddenly, darkness descended upon the sky, and lightning began to fall.

-blink!

Dozens of times a second.

-Crack!

As if aimed at the monsters lining the streets, lightning flashed and monsters fell or exploded as they were struck by lightning.

"Is this....... What the hell......?"

Lightning was wiping out the monsters flooding the streets, as if some divine salvation had been sent to deal with this inexplicable scourge.

Turning her head, Airi could see the blonde, short-haired girl emitting blue electricity from her entire body.

-Quack!

And in the distance, I heard the sound of a fierce bombing.

"I think Elise handled the gate."

Valier drew his sword and walked toward him, accompanied by a girl with forked hair.

"How do you get to...... in Bali?"

"Let's get this place cleaned up and then we can talk."

As bewildered as Airi was, the boy she had just saved was equally dumbfounded.

A catastrophe that felt like it was going to bring the world down was being completely neutralized at the hands of a lightning bolt from nowhere.

"Harriet, you're in charge of finding the Duchess. Do you remember the location?"

"Yes."

"We're on the outskirts of town, so I don't think there are any monsters there yet, but we'd better get going. Riana and the road vampires will be in charge here."

"Okay."

Airi watched dumbfounded as the girl called Herriot was teleported away in continuous teleportation, the blue tattoos reactivating all over her body in an instant.

Valerie sees Airi hugging a boy.

Airi couldn't help but freeze under Valier's gaze.

Rebuilding the Demon Realm and taking revenge on humanity.

If you have done this to save a boy who cooperates with you, you have disqualified yourself as a servant of Valier.

You're bound to be disappointed.

As Airi stood frozen in place, unable to do anything, Vali said nothing, but ruffled the hair of the boy she was holding, not Airi.

As in, I'm glad the boy is alive.

He didn't smile, but he had no expression.

There seemed to be no complaints about the boy's survival and Airi's behavior.

"I see him over there."

Valier pointed to the girl, who was still summoning lightning with a blue lightning bolt wrapped around her body.

"Huh? Ah......."

"He'll take care of everything around here."

He summoned an Alsbringer in his right hand, as if he were going to be in a place she couldn't see.

-Chee!

As Valier watched the monsters pour in from one side of the alley, the flames consumed them in an instant.

-Breathe!

-Woof!

And in a distant alley somewhere, I could see a flash of divine light.

"We'll talk about this later. I've got to go."

"ugh, ugh......."

Airi watched as Valier took off down the street, and then slumped back into her seat, still clutching the boy in her arms.

"My sister....... We....... Did we buy......?"

As the frightened boy shivered and hugged his neck, Airi gently patted him on the back, frozen herself.

"Yeah....... I guess so......."

I also don't understand the sudden appearance of Valerie.

He didn't come alone, he brought a whole bunch of people with him who might be able to help.
