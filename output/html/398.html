            Episode 397.





Olivia's conclusion was not unique. Even when people are in a state of panic, those who are able to think calmly can reason from the list of victims.

But that's not all, they raided a Merchant Guild branch, wiped out a bunch of powerful Imperials, and vaporized. Maybe demons don't need a good reason to kill powerful people in the Empire.

You can terrorize people by showing them that even the most powerful people can be targeted.

So Olivia's reasoning now falls within the realm of what Special Branch investigators, who don't know the truth about the Raziern raid, can figure out.

"In fact, not only were the powerful men who died there, but their escorts were all highly skilled. Not a large number of escorts, but an elite few. The core of the demons' power is missing here."

"I guess so."

"But there's no sign of large-scale destructive magic being used this time, though I suppose it's possible that veterans of melee combat were involved....... If so, it's either proof that the demons are not a minority, or they've grown in strength....... The appearance of hitherto unseen orcs and goblins suggests the latter."

Orcs, goblins, ogres, and trolls.

Olivia seemed to ponder the possibility that the demons had increased their power just by displaying power they hadn't been sending before.

The suspicion that this might not be the work of demons, but of someone else, seemed to elude Olivia, and rightly so.

Even Olivia, who is as disappointed as a human can be, has a limit to her thinking. If I weren't a demon myself, I'd probably have kicked a few tongues out of the demons' mouths at the idea of something like this happening. If I hadn't been a demon myself, I might have thought that there were some suspicious circumstances, but there are so many suspicious things in the world.

I'm sensitive and serious about it because it's my job. If it were some other faraway place, I'd let it go in one ear and out the other. Even if it was about the devil.

"If the demons attacked to wreak havoc on the Empire, they succeeded, and by sending them not only here, but also to Raziern, they've also shown us that their true power is far greater than we expected."

A significant number of suspects were killed, and a horde of demons attacked Raziern, though they were unable to do any significant damage.

That in itself is already a protest of sorts.

We have enough elite and regular troops. And that we can mass teleport them anywhere in the Empire to wreak carnage instantly.

I didn't actually do it, but that's probably how people and law enforcement are taking it.

"The question is, how did the demons know that so many important people would be at a meeting of this branch of the Merchant's Guild on that day, at that hour?"

Information. Naturally, it's unlikely that most people knew such a meeting was taking place. But the demons knew, and they attacked.

That was because the Merchant Guild Master was a traitor, and it was the Imperials who carried out the raid. We can only assume that Shanapelle was in charge.

Where did the demons get their information?

"The last Crusader raid, and maybe it's just me, but the demons seem to know a lot of secret information."

That was thanks to Radia Schmidt's bullshit, but it was still important information. To the uninitiated, it's easy to think that demons know everything.

"So for now, I think it's best to find out why there were so many people in that Merchant's Guild branch, maybe there was an inside track."

What on earth was this meeting about that had brought so many people to this small southern merchant guild chapter?

Olivia was focused on that.

And then there's the leaker, who, although I can't quite put my finger on it, is closing in on Owen de Getmora.

The more Olivia said this, the more complicated my thoughts became.

Why the hell did Saviolin Tana send me here?

The Special Investigations Unit here was never set up to investigate, it was set up to obscure the truth. Not all investigators know the truth, but at least Scotra Kelton, the head of the unit, does.

The imperial instructions to him would naturally be to cover up the truth.

The Empire intervened to prevent the royal family of Levaina from investigating on their own.

The conspiracy to fabricate an imperial demon attack is not over, but it is still ongoing, as it will end the moment this division closes the case.

So no matter how the investigation goes, the end result will be that it was the work of demons. If the royal family of Levaina tries to intervene in the investigation, the Empire will use any excuse to prevent it, and Levaina has no reason to reject the Empire's personal attention.

This organization was set up to solve cases, but to do so at will. This conspiracy is riddled with suspicious circumstances, but once an agency closes a case, there can be no further investigation, so the final step in the conspiracy is to close the Special Branch's investigation.

But me and Olivia are different. We're the ones who have the power to deny the royal family access to Levaina, but they can't tell me or Olivia what to do.

A normal student would say, "Where are these kids going?" but Olivia is like that, and I'm like that, and I can't treat her like that.

Soon.

We could end up getting to the bottom of it, completely unaffected by their investigative guidelines or intentions. They can't tell us what to do.

"We've checked everything we need to check in the field, so let's go to the Merchant's Guild tomorrow."

"Yes, sir."

Why?

I don't care if me and Olivia ever find out the truth, is that it?



* * *



Tomorrow, Olivia and I will visit the Merchant's Guild headquarters in Raziern.

It was late, so we decided to go to bed early, and Olivia and I went to our respective bedrooms.

But there's a strong possibility that she won't get anything out of it and will only raise suspicions. In that case, we don't know what Olivia's next move will be.

I know the truth, and I can find out as much as I want. I don't need to look anywhere else, I just need to go straight to the ecliptic and meet Owen de Getmora.

A very important meeting has taken place in the south, gathering such powerful people. Why were you, the Guildmaster, not present at such an important meeting?

If you start with something like that and start weaving Owen in, you might get him to admit the truth, but you might also get him to admit that he's suspicious enough to be caught.

Here's the thing.

A very large imperial conspiracy is to be uncovered by the Imperial Investigation Agency. That doesn't happen.

If Olivia ever found out the truth, she would get no credit. Rather, her hatred of humans would build and build.

So I don't want Olivia to find out the truth here, or to believe the fabricated truth.

That's why I'm curious about Savior Tana's thoughts. Why she sent me here to help Olivia, when it's clear that this place isn't dangerous.

You can add at least one to your resume. I helped investigate the location of the demon attack, that's all. Of course, being a member of the Special Investigation Unit for the Demon Attack is a pretty big resume, so it can't hurt.

It's a parachute career, so to speak. I can take any number of low-risk, high-reward positions, and my reputation builds as I go. The Empire doesn't want me to be dangerous, so I'm sure they'll want me to roam these places.

It's a little hard to avoid becoming a manufactured hero.

I'm lying in the bedroom of a royal family member and my mind is racing.

I think it's a good thing Olivia wasn't too hurt when she heard about the engagement.

I went out into the living room to get some water.

-black....... gray.......

Very low, sobbing cries came from Olivia's bedroom beyond the closed door.

Yes.

It can't be good.

In the first place, you're the only one crying.

The person who used to wear a smiling mask all the time, now wears an angry mask all the time.

Olivia's natural inclination to never let anyone see her struggle will never change.

This was hard for me to swallow, so I tried to trust what I saw.

Olivia laughs, even though I know she's always been that way.

I tried to believe he was actually smiling.

-Ugh....... ugh.......

What the heck should I have done.

I.

I couldn't tell anything.

-Eavesdropping on people crying, that's mean.

Of course, Olivia, whose senses are sharper than mine, heard me open the bedroom door and said so from the other side of the door.

-I know you can't come over and give me a hug, but you can give me a pat on the back, silly.

As I stood there, I could hear Olivia's pining from across the bedroom.

After wondering if I should go, I opened Olivia's bedroom door.

I was surprised that it wasn't locked as a matter of course.





When I walked into the bedroom, I found Olivia on the bed, wiping the corners of her eyes.

"I hope it's real, my eyes are shining."

Blindfolded, Olivia says, "I'm not sure.

"No what....... what?"

I can't do this, I can't do that. Olivia lowered the arm that covered her eyes.

I say poured, but honestly, I'm not sure.

In the darkness, I could just make out his slightly slit eyes in the moonlight streaming through the window.

"You're not going to marry me, are you?"

"......."

"You don't even have to say anything. I feel so bad for you."

With that, Olivia pushed herself up slightly and leaned her back against the wall behind the bed.

Olivia wasn't looking at me.

Pouting, Olivia stares out the moonlit window.

"I'm just going to marry the devil?"

"Is that ......?"

"Since you won't look out for me for the rest of my life, I'm going to marry the devil and then put a knife to your throat, you bastard."

Sister.......

It's true....... That's me too.......



* * *



Olivia was joking, but that doesn't mean she wasn't serious. I don't know if she really wants to side with the Demon King. But I think she came to the Kingdom of Levaina because she wanted to know if the Demon King was truly as evil as the world perceived him to be.

Of course, I thought it was funny that she'd never seen a demon, and yet she was talking about marrying a demon as if it were a real thing. I mean, what if demons are genderless, dimorphic monsters?

......No.

I'm a little scared that Olivia will say what the hell does it matter if she's serious.

The next day.

"I don't know the details."

When Olivia and I arrived at the Merchant's Guild chapter in Levaina, we were able to get the story from the chapter leader.

"It would have been a major undertaking for the guild, but in those cases, we don't tend to share information with lower branches like this, just give them a venue. It's not that uncommon, so it's not like......."

From the look on his face, it was clear that he knew nothing about the Levaina Merchant Guild. Olivia stared at her, too, and then nodded.

"I see."

By the way she complied, I don't think Olivia was expecting to get any information from this.

Each of the dead was a major figure in the Empire, from all walks of life. And since the Merchant Guild's business was so important in the first place that information wasn't spread far and wide, Olivia didn't see much reason to doubt what the head of the Raziern Merchant Guild's branch was saying, and neither did I.

Olivia asked the branch manager a few more questions, but didn't get any significant leads.

But important.

That the Merchant Guild headquarters has ordered you to leave the branch empty because they will be using it for a specific period of time.

He was merely following the instructions of his headquarters in Raziern's branch.

"Let's get out of here, Reinhardt."

"Sure."

Olivia left Raziern's branch as if that was enough.

Outside the Merchant's Guild branch, Olivia pressed her index finger to her cheek and shook her head.

It's kind of pissing me off because she's trying to be cute and she's actually cute.

"It's kind of weird that the place was rented for a specific period of time, not a specific date......."

"The meeting could have been for multiple days, and even if it wasn't, you'd still have to clean up after them and take care of other things."

"Hmmm, that's true, I've never met anyone who wasn't a farting mess."

Olivia would have had quite a few meetings with people in high places, even if not now. So it makes sense to me that they would order her to leave for a period of time, not just a specific date.

"There were quite a few priests like that."

"......Priests, too?"

"Yeah, I've heard of some high priests who insist that their prayer space be exactly how they want it, and they drive around in a huge carriage decorated as a chapel. I've heard of some who insist that their sermons aren't for the common people, and they won't let anyone below the rank of ordained priest hear them. There are some people who think they're two or three levels above where everyone else sees them. It's kind of like they deify themselves, which is kind of funny."

The sneer that remained in her ponytail reflected Olivia's contempt for humans.

"Low is low, high is high, and I'm ugly in my own way."

The ugliness that comes from ignorance and lowliness, and the ugliness that comes from knowledge and honor.

Humans are ugly, Olivia seemed to think.

"In that sense, my foster father was a good priest, because he had integrity. It's just that he was crazy."

As disappointed as he was with everyone in the world, he felt that his adoptive father was still a madman who followed his convictions, which was better than most.

Levereer Ranze sought to break away from the Empire and establish the Empire of the Five Great Houses, and with his first great success, he attempted to install Olivia.

It was only as he lay dying that he realized that the gods had never chosen him, and he accepted death. He understood that by killing him, he had earned Tuan's judgment, for he was Tuan's champion.

Olivia looked off into the distance and smiled bitterly.

"That's useless, let's go back to the ecliptic for now. The Merchant Guild Master might know something."

"......Yes."

I knew who to turn to because I knew the truth, but Olivia's thoughts naturally drifted there as well.

Is it really okay for Olivia to see Owen?

If Olivia knew the truth, she would inevitably be in danger. Olivia is an unknown, but she is a champion of Tuan, just like me. But the Empire doesn't know that.

I'll be okay, but will Olivia be okay? But an empire short of people will not want to sacrifice Olivia, who is far stronger than me or Ellen at this point. Especially if they realize that she shares Tiamata with me.

With that thought in mind, I head for the warp gate in Raziern.

-It's their fault!

-They brought the demons!

-Kill! Kill!

There was a commotion in a square in Raziern.

"What's going on?"

"Sure."

It was crowded, and people were being pushed and shoved by the guards.

-Kill the Satanists!

-Kill the infidel!

-Fetch the inquisitor!

"Demon religion......?"

Olivia's expression hardened, and so did mine.

The word I'd long forgotten, but was clearly in the back of my mind.

Demonology.

The name was echoing through the center of Raziern.



* * *



In the middle of the square in Raziern, someone was being mobbed by a cultist.

-Get away! I said get away!

The man who appeared to be in charge of the guard was cursing, but the angry crowd was cursing back and trying to push the guard away. Olivia and I could see people sprawled out on the ground inside the circle of people the guards had formed.

There was nothing in their demeanor that identified them as Satanists because I don't know what Satanists are in the first place.

They just looked like normal people. Young men, women, old men. There were even children.

No matter how you looked at it, they seemed to be just normal people.

-Soon, the Inquisitor of the Five Great Houses will take the proper steps to determine whether or not they are demonists! Those who use private means will be severely punished according to the laws of Levaina!

-How many people have heard them get together and talk about the devil!

-What the hell is a bunch of housebound bastards worshipping a strange idol if not Satanism!

-Kill him! Kill him! He'll come back for more!

-If they bring the demon back to Raziern, you'll be responsible!

Olivia's expression hardened as she looked at the crowd.

"Something happened that you don't understand, so you decided to hate the people around you that you do understand."

"......."

"Isn't that funny, Reinhardt?"

Olivia smiles at me.

"It's the demons who killed the people, and the humans are trying to solve something by killing the humans."

I wonder if the Olivia of old would have helped those persecuted.

They may or may not be Satanists.

However, an event begets many events.

The people of Raziern, the capital of the Kingdom of Levaina, don't trust the investigators sent by the Empire; they trust their instincts.

-They're going to bring the demons back!

The Devil has no reason or justification to answer their call, even if they are indeed Satanists.

How in the world can you lowly creatures, not unlike yourselves, summon a demon to this small town?

But people believe it.

To believe it.

-Oh, look down upon us, O Great God.......

They believe they are doing good because they think killing them is justice.

As such, there seemed to be little awareness that this was murder.

Olivia was laughing at the humans.

I didn't want to laugh at the sight, to be disgusted by it.

"That's sad."

Olivia smirks in surprise at my comment.

"I'm surprised, Reinhardt. You have such humanity."

"Life is too good to be precious."

"....... I guess."

For a moment, I wondered if the devil and the saint had gotten their words backwards.

Olivia stopped laughing at the horrible sight at my words.

"Let's go. This is unpleasant."

However, he didn't seem to have the slightest inclination to intervene in the spectacle.





第398季节





While investigating the manipulated truth, Olivia and I discovered something else.

The people of Raziern, the capital of the Kingdom of Levaina, have been shaken to their core by the shock of a demon attack.

The demons have vanished without a trace, but the demon raids are still here.

They don't know why the demon has attacked Raziern, so they try to find a reason. They don't believe the royal announcement, they don't believe the imperial announcement, they are suspicious of their usual suspects, and they accuse them of demonism.

The reason will usually be trivial.

Always walking around with a sullen look on their face and saying unintelligible things.

You don't socialize well and are a homebody.

You see an unidentified statue in your house and accuse you of being an idolater.

It's probably not the most obvious reason.

In extreme cases, a non-universal human being will be branded as unpleasant, and people will try to make that person deserving of disgust because they don't want to admit that they are unpleasant. This is probably a good thing.

We want someone to be someone who deserves to die, so we make it happen.

Neither Olivia nor I intervened on the scene.

The scene is not under Imperial jurisdiction. The Empire is investigating the demon attack, but that's as far as it goes, and that's as far as my role and Olivia's role goes.

It would be trespassing to interfere in the affairs of the royal family of the Second Empire. And such matters of politics are neither my forte nor my duty. Furthermore, I am not imperial, but I bear the imperial crest, so if I act imprudently, it is the imperial family that will suffer, not me.

I'm a beggar, nominally enrolled in a temple, and I'm thinking about the power of the imperial family and the empire, and I'm actually a demon.

I couldn't help but laugh.

I ask them when they've been to Raziern and we head straight back to the Zodiacal Gradient. The fact that I'm participating in a special activity must have been relayed to the kids by either Mr. Eppinhauser or Savior Tana, so they're not worried about me.

No, you're worried that he might have gone off to do something dangerous.

"Nice imperial crest, by the way, and it gives me direct access to the warp gate. Shall I say I'm a champion of Tuan and ask for one?"

I'd even go so far as to say that it was convenient that Olivia was able to return to the ecliptic immediately.

"Then the Tuan Sect will come to you twenty times a day to tell you that you should live in the arms of the gods, and you'll be fine with that?"

"Ugh, that's true. I suppose I could tell the imperial family, but I'm just saying, I don't want anyone to bother me more."

As we head to the Merchant Guild headquarters in the ecliptic, Olivia stares at me.

"But Reinhardt."

"Yes."

"Do you remember me and the tournament final......."

Radia Schmidt.

I almost lost control of my facial expression at the sudden mention, but I didn't make a weird face.

"Yes, I remember you, Radia Schmidt."

"By any chance, have you seen him since we ran into each other?"

Radia Schmidt was talking crap to Olivia. I told her to leave Olivia alone while talking back to her.

Afterward, Radia Schmidt followed me with the intention of killing me, and Elise subdued her. The information I gained from her allowed me to save Adriana and Olivia.

"No. Why? Come to think of it, I don't think I've seen it in the temple either."

Olivia's expression darkened at my words.

"He's been missing....... since that day."

Despite being disillusioned with the faith and disgusted with those who enforce it, Olivia seems to have a place in her heart as a friend.

We don't have to tell each other what the day is, we just know.

"...... Was he a part of that?"

Olivia lifts her head and looks up at the sky.

"Maybe....... I didn't see it there, of course, but we don't really know who the hell was there, and we don't have a good list of Crusader deaths....... Maybe there......."

Olivia seemed to think that Radia Schmidt was not missing, but had died in a demon attack.

If so, the story would be that the devil saved himself and killed my friend.

"It's not like Radia's body has been found....... I wasn't sure, but with this lack of news......."

Olivia seemed to think Radia's chances of survival were very slim. It seemed the Raziern attack wasn't the only reason she needed reassurance about the demon.

Although chronologically a Temple graduate, Radia Schmidt never graduated and went missing. For reasons I don't know, Temple may have been looking for her whereabouts and may have concluded that she was already dead because of the connection to the Crusader raid.

What the heck is going on with Radia Schmidt at Epiax?

I'm sure Elise can handle it.



* * *



-Whoooooooo

High Epiaxis.

Radia sat in one part of the kitchen, idly watching as sliced vegetables and meat sautéed in a pan of oil, and a pot of stew simmered in another.

"I've noticed before that....... You're a good cook."

Radia swallowed her words carefully, knowing she didn't need to eat.

"If you live long enough, you learn to do things, even if they're the last thing you need."

Eleris sat beside Radia as she cooked, not lifting a finger. She was cooking three dishes at once, all with telekinetic power, so Radia watched helplessly as the ingredients were sliced from thin air into the jars and the fire in the pans was magically controlled.

Radia doesn't realize how difficult this is, but she just stares in wonder.

The shop the demon prince frequented had no utensils, so she couldn't feed him, but when she took charge of Radia's life in Epiax, Eleris brought in household items.

So I've been taking care of them so that they can eat and sleep even though they're lonely.

Radia sees the vampire staring out the window, chin in hand, not even looking at the cooking process.

We've been together for a few months now.

Despite her first impression, Radia realizes that this vampire is only strangely friendly.

I expected him to brainwash me, to modify my mind to favor the demonic forces, but he never said it.

He just wants to take care of himself, he doesn't want anything. She didn't ask for anything, and when she got bored, we would just talk and share ordinary stories. What life was like in the temple, how she came to faith. These personal stories became part of Radia's life.

Even Radia Schmidt admits it now.

You no longer feel any animosity toward the vampire, who is very powerful and kind to you.

No, every last bit of fear, every last bit of embarrassment about even being an enemy, was gone.

It's lonely in this cold, barren castle, but the vampire's hot meals are always on time. He says it would be lonely to eat alone, so he watches over her, never taking a bite himself.

If he seems to be enjoying himself, he'll even give you a big smile.

This vampire is nothing to be afraid of.

When you've gotten good enough at cooking something that's inferior to you to the point where you don't even have to look at it with a telekinetic eye.

If you're this good, you're not doing it for yourself, you're doing it for others.

Someone who cares enough about you that they don't want you to stay in the cold and always cook you something hot to warm you up.

There was no way this thing could be dangerous, Radia had come to realize.

Bowls of warm stir-fries and stews are served to her, and, as always, she sips carefully, savoring the warming flavors.

"Eleris, why did you become a vampire?"

"Hmmm. Why do you want to know that?"

"Just......."

Eleris looks at Radia and gives her a coy smile.

"I don't want to die."

There was no grain of truth in that oversimplification of the past.

"I'm too angry, frustrated, and sad to die this way."

But there was a grain of truth in her subsequent self-help words.

"So I did."

Radia stares at Eleris' complicated expression, which doesn't explain everything in the end.

"But you know what, if you live too long, time dulls everything."

"......."

"No anger, no sorrow, no hatred, no wind, they've all become dull, and in the end I want nothing."

Being without craving.

Radia doesn't know what kind of abject hatred she had in her past, but she senses that Elise is weathered.

"Then....... You're loyal to the devil, for what reason......?"

"Hmmm......."

The smile fades from Eleris's face, and only sadness remains.

"Because there's no wind, but there's work to be done....... because there is something to watch....... must be done."

Elise looks at Radia.

"I'm sorry, I don't have a past to brag about."

"Oh, no, that....... Thanks....... for telling me."

"I'm grateful. It must be lonely in a place like this, and you don't even complain......."

Elise stares out the window at the snow falling, while Radia eats the food Elise has prepared.

Radia had no family.

Raised in an orphanage, he excelled in divine powers, joined the Order of Als, and began reading sermons and scriptures to become a priest.

Radia reflects on her life now that she has fallen away from her faith.

How I came to serve Als and how I came to believe.

I was convinced that I was the chosen one. Unlike other orphans, I was gifted with divine powers, so I was treated specially.

Different foods were placed on the table for her and the other children.

When I tried to share it, I was scolded.

Teachers and priests have always told me to take it for granted, to take it for granted, that I've been chosen by God, that I deserve that special treatment, that it's not given to me by the director of the orphanage, that it's given to me by God, and only you can take it.

Radia believed she was special, and she dug into her faith to affirm that.

Just as it was natural for those lesser than you to be treated less than you. They took it for granted that children who were more talented than the gods were treated with more respect than they were. They thought they had to work harder to be treated better than them.

Talent, power, and a price.

It was a fact of life for Radia.

The one who proved it deserved the one who proved it. That was Radia's truth, and so even if Olivia, who was better than anyone else, had everything in the world, Radia thought she deserved it. Olivia's rejection of it was a sin in itself.

But now.

Olivia eats a hot meal prepared by someone who wants nothing from her. He doesn't want anything from her, doesn't force her to study or pray, but he always asks if she's okay and suggests that we get out of this cold place once in a while and take a walk somewhere nice and fresh.

Though you want nothing from me.

It wants to do anything for me.

"......."

Radia realizes.

I never had a family.

This is what family looks like.

It's the kind of relationship where you don't want anything from each other, but you care about each other more than anyone else.

I guess that's family.

I know she won't consider herself family.

But Radia, who had never experienced such warmth before, was confused.

The process of coming to believe in God required a lot of things, and there was a price to pay. I had to live a better life, read scripture, pray, and study what God claims and seeks.

To believe in God, you had to know God, and the world around you demanded and expected you to know God.

But now.

Radia believes that Elise is harmless to her.

But Radia still doesn't know who Elyse is, and Elyse hasn't told her anything about herself.

I was just there. During that time, Elise's words, actions, and small gestures of caring for herself accumulated and accumulated.

Radia Schmidt came to believe in Eleris.

Belief in a different sense than faith.

For the first time, Radia was feeling it in a being that wasn't even human.

Radia knows something about Elise.

That there are road vampires, and that there are seven families of road vampires, and that this is a place where they gather from time to time.

And Elise, the Gazoo of Tuesday.

You are the master of the house, but there are no other vampires in the house.

Radia knows that much now.

We have before us a being who directly denies the teachings of the Great Master, who taught that all beings are evil.

Radia couldn't find even a hint of evil in Eleris' features.

God.

We've been teaching the wrong thing.

If you don't believe in the goodness and kindness right in front of you, what else is there in the world to believe in?

For Radia Schmidt, that distrust had been brewing for a while.

God might be wrong.

Because.

For Radia Schmidt, the first time she experienced this kind of warmth, something inside her broke.

No, maybe that's not the right way to describe it.

is also a map in cold places.

In this chilly castle where everything is frozen.

Maybe something has melted away.

Zodiacal Gradient, Merchant Guild Headquarters.

"The Guildmaster is currently unavailable."

My request for an interview with Olivia was met with a predictable response. It's entirely possible that there were discussions beforehand. Like, if Olivia Lanchester comes to visit, don't meet her.

"And when will you be back?"

"We don't know the exact timeline either. We only know that you've been very busy lately with some major business matters within the guild, and it could be a few days before you return, or it could be over a week before you return......."

If Owen de Getmora is intentionally avoiding meeting Olivia, then Olivia will never see him again.

Of course, Olivia has no way of knowing that this is an imperial stunt, so it's hard for her to realize that information is being deliberately withheld and that she's being deliberately kept from meeting key players in the case.

Olivia and I were eventually forced to leave the Merchant Guild headquarters without meeting the all-important Owen.

If he's not meeting you on purpose, that's the best thing you can do. You can make up a perfect excuse when you do meet, but it's best not to have the conversation at all. At this point, you won't be under suspicion.

"That's refreshing......."

I've traveled all the way to the southern kingdom of Levaina and back to the Yellow Road, but I still can't find my guildmaster.

"I think I'll have to choose between going back to Lazierne and doing some more research, or waiting for the Guildmaster to return."

I was actually glad that Owen wasn't around. If Olivia ever got to the bottom of it, she might actually go beyond her disillusionment with humans and join the Devil's side. If it weren't for me, she might actually join the Devil's side, even if it was only in jest.

Olivia said she needed to be convinced.

It doesn't say what kind of conviction it is. Whether it's a conviction to hate demons or humans.

When Olivia learns the truth about what happened, she will be convinced that she hates humans.

If I were the devil and I was found out, I'd be fine, but Olivia's siding with the devil in this situation is like crawling into a fire.

"Let's go back to Raziern."

"Do you think so?"

So I wanted to avoid any situation where Olivia might run into Owen.

The distance itself is huge, but with the warp gate, getting there and back was a snap.

The trip back to the ecliptic and then back to the field, to Raziern, was just as quick.

"I always feel like, how the hell are people going to live without warp gates......."

Olivia started to say something about the convenience of the warp gate, but then shut up.

And it was the same for me.

Olivia narrowed her eyes at the spot in the plaza where the warp gate was located.

The time it took us to leave Raziern, stop by the Merchant Guild headquarters, and return was about three hours. Even with the warp gate, we still had time to actually get to the Merchant Guild headquarters.

So, we were back in Lazerne in three hours.

"What is....... this?"

Olivia mutters in a shaky voice.

In just three hours.

-Burn! Burn the infidels!

People who had been accused of being satanists were hanging from poles.
