            Episode 398





While investigating the manipulated truth, Olivia and I discovered something else.

The people of Raziern, the capital of the Kingdom of Levaina, have been shaken to their core by the shock of a demon attack.

The demons have vanished without a trace, but the demon raids are still here.

They don't know why the demon has attacked Raziern, so they try to find a reason. They don't believe the royal announcement, they don't believe the imperial announcement, they are suspicious of their usual suspects, and they accuse them of demonism.

The reason will usually be trivial.

Always walking around with a sullen look on their face and saying unintelligible things.

You don't socialize well and are a homebody.

You see an unidentified statue in your house and accuse you of being an idolater.

It's probably not the most obvious reason.

In extreme cases, a non-universal human being will be branded as unpleasant, and people will try to make that person deserving of disgust because they don't want to admit that they are unpleasant. This is probably a good thing.

We want someone to be someone who deserves to die, so we make it happen.

Neither Olivia nor I intervened on the scene.

The scene is not under Imperial jurisdiction. The Empire is investigating the demon attack, but that's as far as it goes, and that's as far as my role and Olivia's role goes.

It would be trespassing to interfere in the affairs of the royal family of the Second Empire. And such matters of politics are neither my forte nor my duty. Furthermore, I am not imperial, but I bear the imperial crest, so if I act imprudently, it is the imperial family that will suffer, not me.

I'm a beggar, nominally enrolled in a temple, and I'm thinking about the power of the imperial family and the empire, and I'm actually a demon.

I couldn't help but laugh.

I ask them when they've been to Raziern and we head straight back to the Zodiacal Gradient. The fact that I'm participating in a special activity must have been relayed to the kids by either Mr. Eppinhauser or Savior Tana, so they're not worried about me.

No, you're worried that he might have gone off to do something dangerous.

"Nice imperial crest, by the way, and it gives me direct access to the warp gate. Shall I say I'm a champion of Tuan and ask for one?"

I'd even go so far as to say that it was convenient that Olivia was able to return to the ecliptic immediately.

"Then the Tuan Sect will come to you twenty times a day to tell you that you should live in the arms of the gods, and you'll be fine with that?"

"Ugh, that's true. I suppose I could tell the imperial family, but I'm just saying, I don't want anyone to bother me more."

As we head to the Merchant Guild headquarters in the ecliptic, Olivia stares at me.

"But Reinhardt."

"Yes."

"Do you remember me and the tournament final......."

Radia Schmidt.

I almost lost control of my facial expression at the sudden mention, but I didn't make a weird face.

"Yes, I remember you, Radia Schmidt."

"By any chance, have you seen him since we ran into each other?"

Radia Schmidt was talking crap to Olivia. I told her to leave Olivia alone while talking back to her.

Afterward, Radia Schmidt followed me with the intention of killing me, and Elise subdued her. The information I gained from her allowed me to save Adriana and Olivia.

"No. Why? Come to think of it, I don't think I've seen it in the temple either."

Olivia's expression darkened at my words.

"He's been missing....... since that day."

Despite being disillusioned with the faith and disgusted with those who enforce it, Olivia seems to have a place in her heart as a friend.

We don't have to tell each other what the day is, we just know.

"...... Was he a part of that?"

Olivia lifts her head and looks up at the sky.

"Maybe....... I didn't see it there, of course, but we don't really know who the hell was there, and we don't have a good list of Crusader deaths....... Maybe there......."

Olivia seemed to think that Radia Schmidt was not missing, but had died in a demon attack.

If so, the story would be that the devil saved himself and killed my friend.

"It's not like Radia's body has been found....... I wasn't sure, but with this lack of news......."

Olivia seemed to think Radia's chances of survival were very slim. It seemed the Raziern attack wasn't the only reason she needed reassurance about the demon.

Although chronologically a Temple graduate, Radia Schmidt never graduated and went missing. For reasons I don't know, Temple may have been looking for her whereabouts and may have concluded that she was already dead because of the connection to the Crusader raid.

What the heck is going on with Radia Schmidt at Epiax?

I'm sure Elise can handle it.



* * *



-Whoooooooo

High Epiaxis.

Radia sat in one part of the kitchen, idly watching as sliced vegetables and meat saut√©ed in a pan of oil, and a pot of stew simmered in another.

"I've noticed before that....... You're a good cook."

Radia swallowed her words carefully, knowing she didn't need to eat.

"If you live long enough, you learn to do things, even if they're the last thing you need."

Eleris sat beside Radia as she cooked, not lifting a finger. She was cooking three dishes at once, all with telekinetic power, so Radia watched helplessly as the ingredients were sliced from thin air into the jars and the fire in the pans was magically controlled.

Radia doesn't realize how difficult this is, but she just stares in wonder.

The shop the demon prince frequented had no utensils, so she couldn't feed him, but when she took charge of Radia's life in Epiax, Eleris brought in household items.

So I've been taking care of them so that they can eat and sleep even though they're lonely.

Radia sees the vampire staring out the window, chin in hand, not even looking at the cooking process.

We've been together for a few months now.

Despite her first impression, Radia realizes that this vampire is only strangely friendly.

I expected him to brainwash me, to modify my mind to favor the demonic forces, but he never said it.

He just wants to take care of himself, he doesn't want anything. She didn't ask for anything, and when she got bored, we would just talk and share ordinary stories. What life was like in the temple, how she came to faith. These personal stories became part of Radia's life.

Even Radia Schmidt admits it now.

You no longer feel any animosity toward the vampire, who is very powerful and kind to you.

No, every last bit of fear, every last bit of embarrassment about even being an enemy, was gone.

It's lonely in this cold, barren castle, but the vampire's hot meals are always on time. He says it would be lonely to eat alone, so he watches over her, never taking a bite himself.

If he seems to be enjoying himself, he'll even give you a big smile.

This vampire is nothing to be afraid of.

When you've gotten good enough at cooking something that's inferior to you to the point where you don't even have to look at it with a telekinetic eye.

If you're this good, you're not doing it for yourself, you're doing it for others.

Someone who cares enough about you that they don't want you to stay in the cold and always cook you something hot to warm you up.

There was no way this thing could be dangerous, Radia had come to realize.

Bowls of warm stir-fries and stews are served to her, and, as always, she sips carefully, savoring the warming flavors.

"Eleris, why did you become a vampire?"

"Hmmm. Why do you want to know that?"

"Just......."

Eleris looks at Radia and gives her a coy smile.

"I don't want to die."

There was no grain of truth in that oversimplification of the past.

"I'm too angry, frustrated, and sad to die this way."

But there was a grain of truth in her subsequent self-help words.

"So I did."

Radia stares at Eleris' complicated expression, which doesn't explain everything in the end.

"But you know what, if you live too long, time dulls everything."

"......."

"No anger, no sorrow, no hatred, no wind, they've all become dull, and in the end I want nothing."

Being without craving.

Radia doesn't know what kind of abject hatred she had in her past, but she senses that Elise is weathered.

"Then....... You're loyal to the devil, for what reason......?"

"Hmmm......."

The smile fades from Eleris's face, and only sadness remains.

"Because there's no wind, but there's work to be done....... because there is something to watch....... must be done."

Elise looks at Radia.

"I'm sorry, I don't have a past to brag about."

"Oh, no, that....... Thanks....... for telling me."

"I'm grateful. It must be lonely in a place like this, and you don't even complain......."

Elise stares out the window at the snow falling, while Radia eats the food Elise has prepared.

Radia had no family.

Raised in an orphanage, he excelled in divine powers, joined the Order of Als, and began reading sermons and scriptures to become a priest.

Radia reflects on her life now that she has fallen away from her faith.

How I came to serve Als and how I came to believe.

I was convinced that I was the chosen one. Unlike other orphans, I was gifted with divine powers, so I was treated specially.

Different foods were placed on the table for her and the other children.

When I tried to share it, I was scolded.

Teachers and priests have always told me to take it for granted, to take it for granted, that I've been chosen by God, that I deserve that special treatment, that it's not given to me by the director of the orphanage, that it's given to me by God, and only you can take it.

Radia believed she was special, and she dug into her faith to affirm that.

Just as it was natural for those lesser than you to be treated less than you. They took it for granted that children who were more talented than the gods were treated with more respect than they were. They thought they had to work harder to be treated better than them.

Talent, power, and a price.

It was a fact of life for Radia.

The one who proved it deserved the one who proved it. That was Radia's truth, and so even if Olivia, who was better than anyone else, had everything in the world, Radia thought she deserved it. Olivia's rejection of it was a sin in itself.

But now.

Olivia eats a hot meal prepared by someone who wants nothing from her. He doesn't want anything from her, doesn't force her to study or pray, but he always asks if she's okay and suggests that we get out of this cold place once in a while and take a walk somewhere nice and fresh.

Though you want nothing from me.

It wants to do anything for me.

"......."

Radia realizes.

I never had a family.

This is what family looks like.

It's the kind of relationship where you don't want anything from each other, but you care about each other more than anyone else.

I guess that's family.

I know she won't consider herself family.

But Radia, who had never experienced such warmth before, was confused.

The process of coming to believe in God required a lot of things, and there was a price to pay. I had to live a better life, read scripture, pray, and study what God claims and seeks.

To believe in God, you had to know God, and the world around you demanded and expected you to know God.

But now.

Radia believes that Elise is harmless to her.

But Radia still doesn't know who Elyse is, and Elyse hasn't told her anything about herself.

I was just there. During that time, Elise's words, actions, and small gestures of caring for herself accumulated and accumulated.

Radia Schmidt came to believe in Eleris.

Belief in a different sense than faith.

For the first time, Radia was feeling it in a being that wasn't even human.

Radia knows something about Elise.

That there are road vampires, and that there are seven families of road vampires, and that this is a place where they gather from time to time.

And Elise, the Gazoo of Tuesday.

You are the master of the house, but there are no other vampires in the house.

Radia knows that much now.

We have before us a being who directly denies the teachings of the Great Master, who taught that all beings are evil.

Radia couldn't find even a hint of evil in Eleris' features.

God.

We've been teaching the wrong thing.

If you don't believe in the goodness and kindness right in front of you, what else is there in the world to believe in?

For Radia Schmidt, that distrust had been brewing for a while.

God might be wrong.

Because.

For Radia Schmidt, the first time she experienced this kind of warmth, something inside her broke.

No, maybe that's not the right way to describe it.

is also a map in cold places.

In this chilly castle where everything is frozen.

Maybe something has melted away.

Zodiacal Gradient, Merchant Guild Headquarters.

"The Guildmaster is currently unavailable."

My request for an interview with Olivia was met with a predictable response. It's entirely possible that there were discussions beforehand. Like, if Olivia Lanchester comes to visit, don't meet her.

"And when will you be back?"

"We don't know the exact timeline either. We only know that you've been very busy lately with some major business matters within the guild, and it could be a few days before you return, or it could be over a week before you return......."

If Owen de Getmora is intentionally avoiding meeting Olivia, then Olivia will never see him again.

Of course, Olivia has no way of knowing that this is an imperial stunt, so it's hard for her to realize that information is being deliberately withheld and that she's being deliberately kept from meeting key players in the case.

Olivia and I were eventually forced to leave the Merchant Guild headquarters without meeting the all-important Owen.

If he's not meeting you on purpose, that's the best thing you can do. You can make up a perfect excuse when you do meet, but it's best not to have the conversation at all. At this point, you won't be under suspicion.

"That's refreshing......."

I've traveled all the way to the southern kingdom of Levaina and back to the Yellow Road, but I still can't find my guildmaster.

"I think I'll have to choose between going back to Lazierne and doing some more research, or waiting for the Guildmaster to return."

I was actually glad that Owen wasn't around. If Olivia ever got to the bottom of it, she might actually go beyond her disillusionment with humans and join the Devil's side. If it weren't for me, she might actually join the Devil's side, even if it was only in jest.

Olivia said she needed to be convinced.

It doesn't say what kind of conviction it is. Whether it's a conviction to hate demons or humans.

When Olivia learns the truth about what happened, she will be convinced that she hates humans.

If I were the devil and I was found out, I'd be fine, but Olivia's siding with the devil in this situation is like crawling into a fire.

"Let's go back to Raziern."

"Do you think so?"

So I wanted to avoid any situation where Olivia might run into Owen.



* * *



The distance itself is huge, but with the warp gate, getting there and back was a snap.

The trip back to the ecliptic and then back to the field, to Raziern, was just as quick.

"I always feel like, how the hell are people going to live without warp gates......."

Olivia started to say something about the convenience of the warp gate, but then shut up.

And it was the same for me.

Olivia narrowed her eyes at the spot in the plaza where the warp gate was located.

The time it took us to leave Raziern, stop by the Merchant Guild headquarters, and return was about three hours. Even with the warp gate, we still had time to actually get to the Merchant Guild headquarters.

So, we were back in Lazerne in three hours.

"What is....... this?"

Olivia mutters in a shaky voice.

In just three hours.

-Burn! Burn the infidels!

People who had been accused of being satanists were hanging from poles.
