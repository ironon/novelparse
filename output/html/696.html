Epilogue - Beyond Civilization



The northernmost point of a continent.

Places skewed to the west there too.

A snowy region in a place beyond a vast mountain range that doesn't even have a name because no one lived there before the Gate happened.

A polar region where the only season is winter.

-Hey......! I'm here!

Somewhere on a blizzardy plateau, a cry is heard, and a group of people head to the location.

Soon enough, the dozen or so elders were able to find the beast that had fallen in the blizzard and the man standing by its side.

"Whoa, that's huge, I haven't seen anything like that in three years."

A giant reindeer had fallen with an arrow right through its head.

"Let's strap in, because if we get more snow, we might be stuck in a shelter for a few days."

Everyone works together to tie a rope around the dead caribou. If the blizzard gets worse, they may be stuck in the hut for days without being able to return.

"We don't know, but Berton, he's got to go home, even if the snow is over his height."

"Of course, it's not snow today, it's an avalanche, and I'm going home."

Someone says something and the others start giggling and laughing.

"Let's get moving if we don't want to see Berton freeze to death not knowing what's on his kid!"

The man called Beton laughs at the joke and begins to tie the rope around the reindeer's body so that everyone can drag it along.

They were all dressed in thick robes and each wore a bow.

The man who appeared to be the leader of the pack looked at the blonde man he was roped up with and patted him on the back.

He was the man who shot the bow at the reindeer.

"By the way, Radias, this guy is like a shrine."

"Haha....... You're too kind."

"It's more than a shrine, we've all seen you take down a reindeer we can't even see because of the snow with a single arrow. To be honest, I used to think you were just shooting at random and making weird noises."

No one in the herd has seen a reindeer.

But a man named Radias pointed his bow at a spot in the blizzard, fired a shot, and walked away.

And in the field, a reindeer had fallen.

He's uncannily good at finding his prey, and his arrows always hit the mark.

"You, you."

Everyone nodded in agreement with the head hunter, especially Berton, who looked at Radias and thanked him several times as his wife began to disperse.

The carcass of the reindeer is tied up, and everyone begins to lead the reindeer back.

"By the way, Radias. Aren't you long past your prime, too?"

"When is......?"

"The kid."

"ah......."

"That septuagenarian Berton is going to be a dad today, and you're still not there?"

One person starts to chime in, and then there are comments here and there.

There's a time for everything, and it's probably getting late.

It's fine for your wife, but you're getting old, too.

It's always good to have something in place before you run out of steam.

The young man called Radias merely smirked.

"By the way, Ms. Violet, you said you were helping with the breakup today, right?"

"I don't know, but I'll do what I can to help......."

"Hehe......."

Radias's wife is coming to help Berton's wife give birth today.

But the elders were troubled by this.

"......Is there a problem?"

"For someone as fragile as your wife to do....... for people as frail as you."

-tuk-tuk

Another man punches Radias in the shoulder.

"I'm sure he'd have a fit."

"......?"

"Well, it's a good thing you're a hard-headed man. How did you ever think to come to a place like this with such a slender wife?"

At that, Radias smirked in disgust.

"Ahaha....... I got a bunch of....... of them."

Radias felt a stone in his throat every time he heard those words.

A place that was uninhabited even when civilization was still intact.

A polar region so far removed from civilization that there are no warp gates, and not even the monsters of the blast furnace gates would dare to enter.

Emperor Bertus and Saviolin Tana were living beyond civilization, under new names.

So whenever Bertus hears that Saviolin Tana, the woman he pretends to be his wife, is a frail woman, he can't help but feel a strange, indescribable sensation.



* * *



The village in the snow was not that small.

At just over 300 homes, the community is quite large considering the extreme conditions it faces.

Thousands of kilometers in every direction are uninhabited, and beyond the great mountain ranges to the north lies a frozen, unknown ocean.

Bertus and Tana came to this location on purpose.

I didn't set out to find this environment.

Everywhere civilization exists, it's impossible to hide. So wherever you are, you're being hunted.

The deep backcountry is sometimes discovered by adventurers who stumble upon it.

I ran for my life, but I didn't want to kill anyone.

So we went to a place where there was no foundation for civilization at all.

Deep in the backcountry, where even the monsters don't look.

An inhospitable place for humans, beasts, and monsters alike.

There, he said, he could stay hidden forever.

Bertus and Tana crossed over to the far side of civilization.

And we've reached a place where someone lives in an environment that shouldn't be inhabited by humans.

For an outsider in an environment where outsiders are not welcome, everyone in the village was friendly and welcoming.

I took care of them, even as they wondered how they got here.

I gave them a place to sleep, clothes to wear, and food to eat.

No one asked me why I was there.

To them, the world was a snowy field.

No country, no history, no nation.

All they knew was that at some point, strange-looking beasts started appearing.

The small but sturdy civilization of the Snowfields stood firm in the face of the occasional monster.

To them, monsters were either "inedible" or "something that looked like it would make you sick".

So Tana and Bertus encountered a tiny community in a place where civilization shouldn't exist, and they hunkered down for a while.

A place that is harsh but welcoming, cold but not lonely.

A place so remote from the rest of the world that no one knows about it.

Bertus learned a lot.

How to live in the snow, how to survive.

What to do when you're stranded in the snow.

Beasts live in these extreme environments, and how to find them.

Where temporary huts for hunters are hidden.

I've taken hunting from a hobby in the distant past to a real skill for a living.

"Wow....... I moved fast, it's already here."

Leading the reindeer that Bertus had hunted, they arrived at a village on a snowy plateau.

Obviously, I don't go hunting on snowy days.

With his wife about to give birth, the village hunters are out in force, not for raw meat, but for a feast.

"Elaaaaaaaah!"

Berton begins to run home, screaming his wife's name at the top of his lungs, afraid to return.

Leaving his wife in childbirth to go hunting, he must have had a lot on his mind.

"Radias, why don't you try it this time?"

Bertus knows what the big guy is talking about.

Slaughter.

It was still something he hadn't gotten used to, so the boss hunter tried to get him to do it at every opportunity.

At some point, the boss hunter's earthly purpose became to mold Bertus, an outsider, into the perfect snowman.

"Oh, no, I'll leave it the way it's always been done."

"Tsk. You're good at a lot of things, but I guess you just can't get the hang of it."

"That....... Sorry."

Good hands, good eyes, and fast action.

Everything is perfect, but I can't do things like slaughter or skin them.

The guy who is so close to perfection but always misses the mark.

To the men of the snowfields, Radias is like that, incredibly good, but always disappointing in the wrong places.

"Haha, I thought I was going to see Radias flip out today."

Behind the boss hunter, a longshoreman on a rope chuckled.

-Hahaha!

"......."

In fact, it's not that I don't want to do it, it's that I try to do it.

The first time the boss hunter had him slaughtered as if he could handle it, Bertus had made a fool of himself, picking up a butcher knife and lunging at him.

Upon seeing the parasites spilling out with their entrails, Bertus ran out of the slaughterhouse and vomited.

Bertus could look at the gross, but he couldn't look at the disgustingly filthy.

Instead, the townspeople looked at Bertus as if he were some kind of weirdo and giggled.

After the vomit, word got around to the whole town.

A newcomer, a young man from out of town, vomits at the sight of blood.

Of course, there's no longer that much misunderstanding, but Bertus still can't get his hands on some things.

Bertus now knows.

In this life, you don't have to be super strong in any one area.

It's not just about being good at hunting, it's not just about being good at tracking.

You need to be a jack of all trades.

Hunting is hunting, slaughter is slaughter, cooking is cooking, and you need to know how to build a fire and gather firewood in this polar environment. The list goes on and on.

So, in the early days of settling in, I was sometimes treated like I didn't know what I was doing.

So now Bertus realizes that he has a lot to learn from everyone in this village, men and women, but especially the elders.

Now, I'm kind of doing my part by playing to my strengths and letting others fill in the gaps.

"Anyway, Beton is Beton, but you better get going."

"Yes."

Bertus, too, heads in the direction of Berton's house, which is where Berton ran to.

-delay

Then, the door to Berton's house opens and someone comes out.

Saviolin Tana.

Here, a woman known as Violet staggers out of the room.

Her bob, which had always been short enough to reach the base of her neck, was now long enough to reach below her waist and had to be tied back with a hair tie.

As they say.

Now I just pretend to look like a slender woman.

"......?"

-pull

And then Bertus saw Tana the Savior, her complexion as white as if her soul had been sucked out of her, stumble and fall to the snow.

She's slender and frail, not at all like the savior violin Tana is known for.

-A.......

-aah.......

Is something wrong?

"Hello, honey......?"

Bertus also rushes to Tana's side, who has faltered.

Tana looks up at Bertus, who has approached her in a daze.

His complexion was beyond white.

"Ah, ah....... ah......."

"Moo, is something wrong?"

"Ah, ah....... No."

-aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Behind Tana, who was shaking violently, the Bettens' house was filled with the guttural moans of a woman in the throes of childbirth.

-delay

The door to Berton's house opens cautiously, and the midwife steps out.

"It's nothing, she's in shock, let's get her home, get her some warm water and lay her down."

"Yes......?"

With those words, the old woman closed the door.

Bertus could see Savior Tana's pupils fluttering very violently.

What did you see?

"That....... Honey, honey....... The child is....... He....... just....... Heh, heh, heh....... Ha ha....... Uh, how about....... How....... How? Huh? Huh?"

I'm trying to explain something, but I can't seem to get my head around it.

Everything is fine.

But I must have seen something very disturbing.

Suddenly, Bertus understood why the other hunters were more worried about Violet than Berton's wife, who had given birth.

I knew I would be mesmerized by the birthing process.

Just as Bertus has no immunity to parasites, Tana has no immunity to anything.

The hunters are convinced that Violet, the image of a young foolish woman here, must be.

"I'm....... and I'm useless......."

Bertus smiles bitterly at the sight of Tana, her head hanging low and shivering.

"Let's go back."

"Yes......."

Supporting the trembling Savior Tana, Bertus made his way to their home.



* * *



Bertus sat Tana down on the bed and gave her a cup of warm water.

Bertus smiled as he watched Tana gulp down the not-so-hot water.

Not long after Tana and Bertus arrived, the villagers built a house of their own.

Even though supplies were scarce, people scrambled to find materials and quickly built a house.

Then he shoved them both in, saying, "Live here.

They never said they were going to settle down, never said why they were here.

They built the house without asking, as if they knew what they were doing.

So Tana and Bertus had no choice but to sit down.

Bertus tried to help out in the village after that, and realized how much he didn't know. And what he didn't know, he learned.

But in Tana's case, it was even worse.

Beyond not being able to cook, I don't even know how to cut meat.

I don't know how to sew, let alone trim leather.

I don't know how to start a fire

Not surprisingly, I have no idea how to make the most important storage food in this environment.

I can't even play with my kids.

You can't help but smile embarrassedly in front of your kids.

Someone who doesn't know what to do with themselves when you give them a chore from the village.

She has a pretty face, a nice heart, and a nice demeanor, but she is useless to anyone.

Still, she's cute, and it's kind of fun to watch her bewilderment.

The village anaks are secretly envious of his hands, which are so white, clean, and calloused that it's obvious he hasn't done much hard work in his life.

She is confident in her abilities, but people, young and old, discourage her when she tries to do something that she is passionate about.

You don't want someone who's obviously overgrown to get injured trying to get somewhere.

So even when I want to do something I'm really good at, I don't give it a chance.

When I say I want to be a hunter, people laugh at me because I've been building up to it.

Everybody's like, "Don't make a joke about it.

In fact, it's a no-brainer.

I've held a sword all my life.

Everything else, living and otherwise, was supported by the imperial government.

Everything else, except the sword, was probably a good thing, and had always been somehow. It just wasn't any of her business.

So Tana doesn't know anything about swords, and she doesn't have any hair.

She is a person who has spent her life doing what she is good at and is complete with it.

If you suddenly ask someone like that to do something they have no connection to, you're lucky if they don't panic and cry.

So when I show you a job to do this, you're still saying, "What is this?

Even if it's something you taught them once.

I can't seem to get the hang of it.

Tana is even more incompetent than Bertus, the emperor.

This is the reality of Saviolin Tana, formerly the strongest knight in the Empire and the First Sword of the Continent.

"Have you calmed down a bit?"

"Yes......."

Once again, she had gone out to attend to the village's big event of childbirth, only to be told to go back to the midwife and rest.

She's seen people die, she's done it, and she's seen some ugly shit.

But it's unlikely that she's ever experienced the spectacle of the birth of life, and the shock of it all.

How?

How?

I'm glad I didn't pass out with a head full of question marks and exclamation points.

Bertus said nothing as he watched Tana fiddle with her water cup and catch her breath.

Bertus is the closest to her, and he knows she's suffering from the realization of how incompetent she's been.

Bertus looks at Tana and smiles faintly.

"That's not easy."

"......Yes."

The villagers who saw the couple respect each other always laughed, thinking they were cute.

No one asked why the couple was acting so strangely.

No one asked if it was a married couple.

At least Bertus is now a man, and his hunting skills are proving to be a boon to the village.

But Xavier Tana still can't do anything, and in the eyes of the world, she's just a fragile, foolish woman.

However, no one was overly critical of Tana's incompetence.

They may tease her playfully, but none of the villagers take her seriously.

That's because everyone saw them the day they arrived in town.

Through a violent blizzard, on the verge of collapse, unable to tell if it was a person or a snowball.

Everyone remembers the venomous look on Saviolin Tana's face as she arrived, clenched teeth and wide-eyed, carrying a stunned Bertus.

When asked how she got here, Tana said.

It was like there was a village here.

I heard the sound of an inhabited place.

But it had been more than three days since she'd heard it and walked over.

She heard a sound she couldn't hear, found her way through a blizzard, and reached this village.

So everyone says.

Foolish.

I don't even know how to do it.

No matter what you do, you're bound to get into trouble.

Great guy.

That's why no one can ignore Saviolin Tana.
