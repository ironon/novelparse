            Episode 624.





A city in ruins, somewhere on a continent.

A street in an abandoned city that has become unrecognizable.

There were a few figures in robes gathered there.

"The Immortals have already finished laying out their lines, and now the Allies are going to move again, and we're all going to the front."

Christina, clad in robes, spoke to the others, who, like her, were clad in black robes.

"How's the reverse recall device doing?"

"I've already seen it work on a couple of initial startups, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem with a high loss rate."

"All good."

The men in black robes looked at Christina and nodded.

"We were never in a position to say we had a lot of time, but they've done a good job so far."

At the black-robed men's flattering words, Christina nodded.

"What's next?"

"Then......."

The men in black robes were silent for a moment at Christina's question.

"I know it's ridiculous to be discussing this before the Gate debacle is over, but isn't it about time we talked about it?"

The black robes fall silent at Christina's question.

After the Gate debacle. What to do next.

One of the black robes says.

"The empire has outlived its usefulness."

An empire that has done so much evil to survive has lost its rationale and legitimacy.

For now, the rhetoric may keep it afloat, but when the Gate debacle is over, people will want to hold the Empire accountable.

"To survive, the Empire will have to find its next cause."

"Is it the devil?"

"Yeah."

If your empire is being sustained by the absolute rationale of the gate crisis, once that rationale is gone, it's time to find the next one.

All in the name of killing the demon that caused it all.

"It was a rationale for the Empire to unite all of humanity. Why not use it again?"

It was the existence of the Darklands and the Demon King that allowed the Empire to unite all of humanity so long ago.

To all attempts at division and to the forces of discord, it was said, "How should we fight among ourselves when the devil is strong?" There was no cause that outweighed that cause.

No empires were created, no empires were maintained.

If the devil doesn't exist, it's not possible in the first place.

So after the Gate debacle, it's just a matter of reverting to the old rationale.

"But the masters of the empire need not be the House of Gradias. All that is needed is for the mistakes of the last empire to die with the House of Gradias, and for a new one to be born."

Empires must exist to unite humanity. However, its masters may change.

At Black Robe's words, Christina stares at him.

"If you're going to maintain an empire in the name of the Devil, he's not on the list, is he?"

It's about uniting humanity against an enemy, and that enemy is the devil.

So the Black Robes were not planning on the Devil becoming the next ruler of the Empire.

"Of course, demonic rule would be unacceptable to most people. The chaos would be far greater than the current state of the Empire."

"Hmmm....... Yeah. Because you said it's more about how people perceive you than what you actually did wrong......."

Christina smiles meaningfully and nods slowly.

"So, who's supposed to be the next master of the empire, you guys?"

"......No way. We have a policy of not being up front."

The attitude of the men in black robes was resolute, as if they had no intention of abandoning their principles despite being reduced to a tiny minority.

"Yeah, that's what I'm curious about, because even though it's only now decaying like this, the Order's lore is still intact, its magic is still intact, and that's why it can create immortals, so what's the need to only move from behind like this?"

"There are some things that can only be done behind the scenes, and we're a group built to do those things."

A banner for humanity.

The Black Order is willing to betray humanity for the sake of its banner.

The moment they come to the forefront, their meaning fades. So instead of coming to the forefront, they do what only they can do: stay behind the scenes of history.

"There are many possible candidates to become the next Lord of the Empire, but they must first have some distance from the Empire, have earned enough majors to close the Gate, and be a worthy leader of humanity in their own right."

"Louise von Schwarz of Cernstadt is a possibility. She is the largest power after the Empire, and her character and personality are neither extreme nor overly compromised. She has the character to be a leader, and I can't fault her major. However, she almost certainly killed her own siblings with her own hands, which could prove to be a weakness in the future."

"The Grand Duke of Saint-Antoine, Raphael de Saint-Antoine, is not without possibility. His expertise in creating Titans is unparalleled, and he has remained true to the time-honored House of Saint-Ouen principle of walking the straight and narrow. While it is the opposite of our position that the power of an apostle should be wielded wherever possible, the attitude of the House of Saint-Thuan and its current patriarch, Grand Duke Saint-Thuan, deserves the respect and admiration of the people. In this case, however, the daughter is too great a risk, and no matter how well she does, she is not properly recognized by the people."

"There are a few other candidates, but ultimately there are issues with them being less powerful, less specialized, or not being able to take on the other big players."

"Because."

"Eventually."

"Ellen Artorius."

"She is suitable."

"The power, the symbolism, the people's support all point to her."

"If she can lay the foundation for the next empire, that would be the best outcome."

A great weight in the name of the warrior.

The Empire has lost its legitimacy, and there is an enemy worthy of extermination.

The warrior becomes a name and a symbol that weighs more than any nobleman, more than any king.

In the aftermath of the Gate, the fall of the old empire and the rise of the new will be necessary for the unity, prosperity, and unity of humanity.

Ellen Artorius becomes master of a new empire.

The Black Order decided that this was the best ending for the situation.

Christina remained silent, listening to the story.

It was the man with his back against the wall at the edge of the meetinghouse who had been silent until now.

"After all....... again."

At the sudden words, the gazes of the black-robed men turn toward them.





"Are you going to tell Ellen, who can barely stand to be called a warrior, that she must now become an emperor?"

His haphazardly grown black hair fell to the base of his neck, and his arms were bandaged outside his cloak.

"I have a question."

Black, abyssal eyes, visible through the haphazard growth of his hair, stare at those in robes.

"Who the hell are you guys to decide something like that?"

A hush falls over the room.

"Who the hell are you guys to tell me what the world is and what it should be, and how can you be so sure it's the way it should be?"

The man with the bandaged right arm, Ludwig, stares at everyone with eyes as deep as the void.

"Because that's the way to go for everyone."

The corner of Ludwig's mouth twitches up at that.

"Yeah....... That's the best justification ever."

"The only and absolute excuse for all evil deeds, all sin, and all blame."

"That disgusting sound of a path for all was what brought you here, and it was what you said to rationalize yourselves."

"For everyone?"

"No....... No."

"That horse is there for you."

"I mean, people who pick up on that."

"It's just an excuse for you guys."

"You're just as much an accomplice to the Gate debacle, aren't you?"

"You just want to run the world your way."

"When things go wrong, are you going to say, like anyone else in the world, that you didn't really mean for this to happen?"

"In the face of such a disastrous outcome, are you going to tell me that you didn't actually want this?"

"And then you're going to try to manipulate the world by trying to solve a problem that you got wrong, claiming you're going to get it right this time?"

For the world.

For the sake of humanity.

For the good of all.

They are merely excuses prepared for those who would do such a thing.

"So, what are you saying?"

The men in black robes say.

"Do you have the best answers, do you know who should be the next master of this world, do you know how to make peace, how to completely erase the seeds of another conflict of division and killing?"

Ludwig shakes his head at the question.

"Is your statement that all the world's problems would disappear if Ellen became emperor correct?"

"......."

"Since the Order of the Lord has already fallen to the Devil, if Ellen becomes Emperor, are you saying that they will simply support the warrior who became Emperor and be done with it?"

"......there's going to be some noise."

Ludwig smirked at that.

"It's just that what you guys are proposing is one of the ways, and even if the empire exists as it is, even if the world falls to the devil, even if Ellen becomes emperor, something is going to go wrong somewhere, and someone is going to die somewhere."

"I used to think there was a right answer, and I was just too stupid to get to it. That's what I thought."

"But now I know."

"That there was no right answer, just the only right answer."

"I thought you said each of you was a little bit responsible for all of this?"

"Whoever owns the next continent is going to be a little bit right and a little bit wrong."

"I mean, there's no such thing as a perfect answer."

"So without you, the world will have another answer that's just a little bit wrong, but just a little bit right."

"I'm not going to bother with that."

"I don't need to think of the right answer."

"Punishment, not answers."

"You who want to be judged on your intentions, not your results, on the subject that caused all of this. People like you who keep trying to push your own answers in the name of what's best for everyone."

"To erase the likes of you from the world."

"That's what I'm going to do."

I don't know the answer.

It doesn't even exist.

But then there are those who try to manipulate the world by insisting that they've found the right answer this time.

People who have never had to pay for a wrong answer, who keep telling me they have good intentions, who run the world and try to victimize me.

Ludwig thinks they should be wiped off the face of the earth.

Order's words that Ellen should be Emperor.

It can also lead to a good ending.

However, it's already disgusting that there are people behind the scenes trying to manipulate the world with words like that.

At Ludwig's threatening demeanor, the mages begin to rise from their seats one by one.

"Christina, I don't know if this is what you wanted to do in the first place."

When asked if bringing Ludwig to the Order's meetinghouse was the plan all along, Christina shrugged.

"The devil is in the details, so to speak."

Christina was sending frosty glances toward the robes.

Something starts to creak.

In fact, it's a given.

What the Emperor once tried to say, Christina gives back to the wrong people.

"If the world turns out the way you say it will, it will be so disgusting."

There was madness in her eyes, filled with hatred and anger.

Similar to Ludwig, but a little different.

It was, well, vengeful.

Surviving because those responsible are doing it for the world.

As if he couldn't stand it.

"So, I don't need you guys anymore."

"You know you're not the only one who can say that."

Mutually beneficial.

It's been a fact of life for Juji since the beginning.

The wizards of the Black Order are preparing something.

"Why, to summon an immortal?"

"......!"

The moment she reads the intent, she sits back and shrugs.

"Didn't you guys realize that you gave it to me with no safeguards in the first place?"

The fact remains that they were only temporarily cooperating in the name of Gate.

"Well, it's obvious: If I try to betray you, you'll try to take control of the Immortals, and you've already made arrangements for that."

"......."

"It's weird when they don't do that."

The wizards are silenced by Christina's words.

Immortals are controlled by magic. It makes sense, then, that they would have the means to do so, putting the technology in Christina's hands and using the resources of the Empire to perfect it.

Immortals become the property of the Black Order at the moment of absolute necessity.

Just as the Emperor knew what would happen the moment he created the Immortal, yet allowed it to happen, so too did Christina not assume that he had no such intentions.

Christina laughs.

Laugh at the wizards of the Order.

"By the way, isn't it a bit optimistic to think that you guys would have created an immortal exactly as you instructed?"

"......Did you think that was magic you could touch?"

The knowledge that the Black Order has imparted is immeasurable.

Simply implementing how to create an immortal is already the domain of geniuses.

However, finding and modifying the Black Order's hidden formulas is impossible.

The Black Order, of course, predicted what their opponents would predict.

I said, "If you want to do it, go for it.

"There are a lot of unreasonable geniuses in the world, and I guess you guys didn't expect that on the subject of secret societies."

It was home to some of the continent's greatest minds.

Only those who have talent know how unreasonable it is.

"......Why, it's not working?"

"......."

Already seeing in their expressions that her arrangement had worked, Christina smiled wickedly.

It's not that the Black Order was stupid.

It's just that someone's genius overwhelmingly exceeds someone else's expectations.

The Black Order was in decline.

The leaders are all dead.

Even the last of the remaining masters had been oxidized in the fight with the demon earlier.

What's left are the Black Order, who weren't so great after all.

Sadly.

It's just dregs.

The magic, visions, and arts of the great leaders are intact, but they can't even begin to embody them.

Residuals.

It was inevitable that they were unaware of the accidents of geniuses and the dangers of geniuses.

The only thing they could do with their rampage was to gain access to the Empire and the Temple geniuses who could harness its power.

It was the last thing they could do.

Those with the ability and talent have already died fighting the monsters of the Gate and battling demons.

That's about as far as they could go.

"In the end, does it look like this......."

One of the Order's wizards finally shakes his head.

Who knew this would happen?

They just needed to do something, and they wanted to do something, even though they knew that everything they ended up with wasn't going to be the way they wanted it to be.

The people who used to run the world from behind the scenes are now too good to do so.

And yet, in trying to do so, they ended up playing into the hands of those who hate them.

It's a simple story.

I tried to take advantage of it, but it took advantage of me.

They tried to take advantage of each other, and in the end, the weaker party got taken advantage of.

"Ludwig."

At Christina's urgent call, Ludwig's right hand surges with energy.

The sword is energized and takes the form of a sword.

Ludwig walks slowly toward the wizards awaiting death.





第625集





A street in an abandoned city.

"I'm surprised you didn't try to run away."

Christina muttered to herself as she looked at the Order's mages, the ones who had been slain, and the way they lay dead.

Ludwig's right arm was still bandaged, as if he'd just summoned an ominous, eerie Auror Blade of Darkness.

The Order's mages were all slaughtered by Ludwig.

He didn't even try to run away.

"You knew there was no point in trying to run away."

"I don't know."

Anna de Guerna, waiting in the distance, approaches over the ruined rock ledge.

"No life detected nearby. This is....... that's all."

Anna looks away from the dead bodies with a stony expression.

Even if she had tried to flee, she would have been caught in Anna's spell, and the Immortal Archmages waiting in the distance were raising their shields.

"There might be a residual, but it doesn't matter, they're not going to take the immortal out of our hands anyway."

With that, the Black Order disappeared from the world for good.

You may have missed one or two, and you may have survived, but there's no point in trying.

"It's kind of scary to think that if it wasn't for Louis, I might have lost my entire immortal."

Christina grinned wickedly.

The intentions of the Black Order were obvious to begin with.

That's why he focused on uncovering the Black Order's tricks.

If it weren't for Louis, the Black Order would have tried to bend the world to their will, if not by force. By using immortals.

I wouldn't even call it a battle.

In a battle of genius and intrigue, genius won.

The Immortals that the Black Order wanted to make their army are now Christina's army.

"Ludwig, what do you think?"

"What?"

"Ellen becomes emperor, the devil becomes emperor, and things stay the same."

Christina asks.

"What do you think is better?"

To Christina's question, Ludwig says simply, as if it's a no-brainer.

"I don't know."

It was a straightforward answer, without even a second thought.

"Well, it'll work out."

It's good to be ignorant of what you don't know.

There's something you want to do.

Then it just does it.

Let the world's business be the world's business.

Ludwig replies and stares at his right hand.

The Grandmaster's arm gave Ludwig great strength.

Ludwig had the power to skip several steps.

But he couldn't get used to the foreign sensation of his own body.

It was an impossible procedure for the average person to endure.

'Years at most.......'

The Dettomorian's words that you're going to die.

Now Ludwig truly understood what he was talking about.

It's only been a few days since I've been able to get up and move around properly, after enduring pain that would have killed me.

At some point, your body will reach its limits.

We were paying the price now, in real time, for putting things together that shouldn't have been put together in the first place.

"Are you okay......?"

Anna studied Ludwig's complexion with concern. Ludwig nodded with a stony expression.

The body is still holding up.

I can fight again.

Until the body is shattered.

Until you finish what you need to do.

You just have to hang in there until then.

"Yeah. It's okay."

Not yet.



* * *



"Report on the readiness of all troops for departure."

With the telepathic Ibiaman in front of him, Emperor Bertus sat still in the barracks of the General Headquarters.

She sends telepathic messages to the commanders of each of the armies, and they report back to her, summarizing the situation.

"The whole army is ready, Your Majesty."

Telepathic abilities streamline the communication process.

So Ivia was acting as a messenger, not moving from her seat.

"We will begin our march toward Gethosia tomorrow. We estimate that it will take us ten days to reach Gethosia, and the advance party will have already cleared the warp gates on a small city-sized scale, so there will be combat upon arrival. Make sure your respective commanders are fully aware of that fact."

If you're running Immortals, you can probably leave the small and medium-sized warp gates to them.

The only time you'll need to go all-out is when you're trying to capture a large city warp gate. These will get progressively harder, so if Gethonia isn't a breeze, expect it to get harder later on.

If Gethonia was difficult to capture now that we had the unrivaled army of Immortals, the remaining battles would be even more daunting.

The weather eased up, and the troops had a long winter's rest.

"Starting tomorrow, until we see a complete end to the gate situation, the military will not stop."

The Emperor blandly gave the order, and Ivia was quietly spreading the word to all the military commanders.



* * *



Leading up to the departure, the garrison was quieter than busy.

With the bare minimum of tents and supplies, the long march was about to begin.

Like a beast ready to wake up after a long, long winter's sleep.

From now on, there will be no such long breaks.

The end of war, the end of humanity.

The army will advance until one of the two paths is clear.

In this tranquil garrison, those who had been in the temple so far were ready to depart.

Christina.

Anna.

Louis Ankton.

And Ludwig.

Naturally, everyone was horrified.

Ludwig, who lost his arm and had to return home, has clearly gotten his right arm back, albeit in a sling.

"Ludwig? No, that arm is......?"

Ludwig smiled sheepishly at Lanyon Sessor's question.

"There was an experimental procedure, and I was the first patient."

"Are you okay......?"

"Uh, it moves surprisingly well."

Ludwig demonstrated that he was fine by clenching and unclenching his fist and moving his arm up and down.

There are certain procedures that can restore a missing arm.

None of us had a clue what it was, so we were at a loss for words as we watched Ludwig's nonchalant demeanor.

Getting your arm back is great, but is it really in a condition to fight?

Judging by his bandaged arm, Ludwig didn't look like he was in any condition to fight.

Ludwig shook his head, as if he knew the concern.

"He's not going to be in direct combat, he's going to be in a rear support unit, so don't worry about it."

"Ah, ah, ah....... I see."

It was a lie.

Ludwig was supposed to be working with Immortal.

In a way, he was fighting in the most dangerous place since the rearguard action began. Ludwig had no need or reason to tell his friends.

Rumors of Ludwig's sudden return and regained right arm were bound to spread through the Royal Class garrison.

Scarlett heard about Ludwig's news, and she couldn't help but come to him.

"Ludwig......?"

"Scarlett, it's been a while."

Scarlett stared at Ludwig's new right arm, her mouth hanging open in disbelief.

Ludwig explained to the others what had happened to his arm and told them not to worry, as he would never have to go into battle himself.

"That would be great, but......."

But everyone was looking at Ludwig, who had returned, and feeling uncomfortable.

Aside from getting his arm back, you can't help but notice the change in Ludwig's mood.

Ludwig's eyes are dark and sullen. You sense something in his disheveled appearance.

Plus, it was obvious to anyone with a little bit of eyesight.

The lengths of Ludwig's left and right arms are a bit odd.

The right arm was a little longer. Slightly unnaturally so.

We don't know what the experimental procedure was, but we do know that it was no ordinary procedure.

Ludwig's return had a dangerous air about it, and we couldn't help but feel a subtle sense of foreboding.

"......."

"Cliffman, it's been a while."

He also encountered Klippmann, who urged Ludwig to retreat from the battlefield.

Ludwig, who was told by Klippmann to go home and not bother anyone, eventually returned and regained his right arm through some means.

Ludwig greets him with an unchanged demeanor, while Klippmann stares at him with a stony expression.

"That bastard......."

Klippmann looked at Ludwig, as if premonitioning something, and shook his head in annoyance.

After greeting one by one the familiar faces who had returned after such a long absence, Ludwig prepared to march and walked through the garrison as night fell.

Ludwig doesn't fight with Royal Class garrisons or Allied main armies anyway.

Rather, they would spend more time fighting alongside the Immortals than in the garrison.

I'm just saying hello to make sure it's not weird to be in the garrison.

However, not everyone was buying Ludwig's lie.

"Hey......."

Heinrich von Schwarz.

When Heinrich realized what was happening on the ecliptic, he could only stare at Ludwig as he returned with his arm back.

"I think that's....... right?"

Heinrich knew immediately how Ludwig had gotten his arm back.

He must have been transplanted with a black magic reconstructed arm.

I risked my life to get my arm back.

And I don't know how to overcome that rejection and other issues.

Only Heinrich knew that Ludwig was in a very dangerous state.

So, Heinrich knows that Ludwig is lying when he says he won't fight.

"Did you really....... did you really have to do that?"

"Well."

Ludwig smiled bitterly at Heinrich's question.

"Even if you're nothing, you can do something......."

"......."

"I wanted to make sure of that."

It's already happened.

Irreversible.

Heinrich could say nothing to Ludwig, who had already done the deed.

Heinrich says it through clenched teeth.

"You're going to fight and die."

Heinrich seemed to understand now what the Dettomorian prophecy had foretold.

Just like that.

Ludwig spotted someone standing on a hill in the middle of nowhere, overlooking the Royal Class garrison.

Ellen Artorius.

In the light of the full moon, Ellen stood still on the hill, looking down on the garrison as if observing.

Ludwig looked up at Ellen on the hill without speaking.

After helping Ludwig pursue the case without asking, Ellen returned to the garrison as if she were running away.

It was the first time I'd seen it since.

Ellen looks at Ludwig, her eyes moving slowly toward him.

There was no emotion in his eyes.

Ellen didn't say anything.

Not how did you get back, or what happened to your arm.

I wasn't panicked or intimidated.

There were no thoughts, no emotions, just an awareness that there was a person there.

"You're different."

Looking at Ellen, who somehow seemed to have become a different person altogether, Ludwig said.

More than she had changed, Ellen had become strangely different.

Something has changed.

Everyone changes.

It's going to change.

"......."

Dead-eyed Ellen gave no answer or reaction.

I just stood there in the moonlight, staring at Ludwig.

No longer did Ludwig ask the moonlit still life anything.



* * *



The Allies move.

The danger is in the longevity of the group itself.

If it can be done quickly, that is the only good in war. Now that they have enough power, the Empire will immediately set out to destroy the warp gates across Ryzeln.

The empire had to pass through many small and medium-sized cities to reach its next destination, so the march would have taken a long time if it had been the same as before.

"You swept......."

But now, I was looking at a city in ruins, smoldering with smoke and flames.

"......I expected it to be a lot."

What was the name of the city?

I don't remember, but it was a city with one medium warp gate and two small warp gates.

But all I and Eleris could see was a trail of destruction and carnage.

Small and medium-sized towns and cities could be wiped out in less than half a day with just Immortal.

As much as we would have loved to see the Immortals in action, we were a bit late to the party, as we didn't want to draw any attention to ourselves.

Eleris is usually pale in complexion, but she was almost blue in the face.

Eleris could not help but fear the power of a cornered human.

Maybe the gate debacle is over.

"Depending on how the battle for Gethsinothia goes, the Alliance may be forced to withdraw entirely."

"Maybe."

If it appears that Immortal alone can handle the gate situation, the coalition may actually disband.

"But each gate becomes more and more dangerous, and it would be foolish to disband the Alliance so quickly. Like it or not, the Alliance can't leave here until every warp gate on Ryzeln is destroyed."

The gate crisis isn't over until the last warp gate is smashed.

If you hastily withdraw and realize that Immortals alone won't end the gate crisis, you'll have to regroup. It's not even funny.

In the end, the coalition must exist until we see a complete end to the Gate debacle.

Immortals are a large army, but they also have a tremendous advantage in mobility, with entire armies being able to move via mass teleportation.

As such, Immortals are able to wipe out these small towns with massive mass teleports across Regellen, just as they would intercept enemy strongholds.

"For now, we'll have to wait and see how the battle for Gethsinothia goes."

At the same time, the war intensifies and deepens.

It's coming to an end.
