"Destroying a warp gate with only a shortstop has become impossible....... This is it."

"I'm afraid so, Your Majesty."

Bertus nodded solemnly at the stern-faced Saviolin Tana's words.

We already knew that as the number of warp gates dwindled, gate-busting operations were becoming increasingly unwieldy.

In the most recent operation, a mission that required the destruction of three warp gates, Savior Tana was forced to withdraw her forces after destroying only one warp gate.

There were too many monsters, and they were too strong.

Two Swordmasters of Shanapelle and four Imperial mages were killed in the operation.

A force that strong is not easily recruited, so this was a devastating loss.

This is master class power that can't be easily replenished, so it's a permanent power loss.

The gate becomes more dangerous, and the shortstop's power continues to decrease.

But the longer we put off closing the gate, the more monsters are released into the world.

"What do you think of combining Ellen's forces with Lord Tana's?"

The rebuilding of the city continues, but the environment has made it very difficult to rescue survivors.

You now change the mission of Ellen's unit to destroy the remaining warp gates and organize a new, very powerful unit.

At the Emperor's words, Tana shook her head in disbelief.

"Doing so would allow us to continue our warp gate destruction operations temporarily, but....... In the long run, we believe that we will suffer another loss like this. Also, the risk of Ellen Artorius being killed....... cannot be considered nil."

Ellen Artorius is killed during a warp gate destruction mission.

That's worse than any catastrophe for humanity.

People have placed a great deal of expectation and hope in Ellen. If Ellen were to die in the fight to control the warp gate instead of the demon, humanity would be plunged into despair and heartbreak.

Ellen was already doing dangerous work, but to push her into something even more dangerous was unacceptable. Continuing to send her on missions with a very high risk of death was something Bertus could not accept.

But we couldn't leave it all up to Savior Tana, either.

The situation is very bad.

It's not like there's no way around it.

"After all....... It looks like we're getting close to the point where we need to organize a large army."

"......Yes, Your Majesty."

You'll have a large army for all-out warfare.

Magical mass migration is not possible.

The assembled army must then travel across the continent, supplied by magic, on an expedition to destroy the warp gates.

In order to preserve the power of the Master Class and the Archmages, they sacrifice those of a lesser level.

We don't even know how many people will die.

If you organize and send out an army of that size, they won't be able to return easily. They would have to travel extremely long distances to the warp gate and fight countless monsters roaming the continent.

You must organize a rallying cry that will not return until all the warp gates are destroyed.

Now that the spearhead can no longer fulfill its mission, it's time to go to war for real.

The organization of a large army leaving for the complete end of the Gate Crisis.

There's no telling how many years it will take for those troops to leave and return, as they'll have to travel huge distances on foot.

Will it ever come back.

However, if the Gate Crisis does not end, humanity will perish.

So it's something that needs to be done.

"We need to have a meeting with the Imperium and the Order."

Bertus decided to scrape together everything he had left and assemble a massive army, the sum total of humanity.

"Your Majesty, the Empress has sent a message to......."

"Reinhardt took him."

Tana knew about the plan.

"......Yes."

Saviolin Tana nodded in disbelief at the Emperor's words.

The empire could not protect the empress.

So we had to play it safe.

"There were some unforeseen circumstances, but....... Let's leave it at that."

In any case, things turned out the way Bertus wanted them to.

A mysterious secret society called the Black Order appeared and tried to kill him.

An unintended consequence was that Ellen, who was present, was forced to fight Reinhardt, but the result was that Reinhardt was defeated by Ellen and faked his escape.

So, while there was a significant amount of unexpected civilian casualties, the mood in the ecliptic was very good.

You failed to execute the Empress, and the demon's minions fled.

But they saw Ellen Artorius overpower the demon.

As if that was all there was to it.

The zodiac was in a state of high spirits, with the belief that, despite the demon's appearance, they had seen a warrior who now had the upper hand over the demon.



* * *



It's been a week since Reinhardt left Edina.

As regent, Charlotte was running her own affairs.

With Reinhard entrusted with full power, Charlotte could conduct state affairs, but she was still more concerned with staying on top of things.

I could have easily organized a vigilante group, codified punishments, and set a standard for the worker bees, but I needed to see a lot of things with my own eyes first.

The Edina Archipelago was always a small country, but as it grew, it became like an overgrown child.

So you can't expect empire-like laws and institutions.

For now, Charlotte focused on Reinhardt's biggest problem: numbers.

The number of people, the amount of food stockpiled, the number of crimes, the number of prisoners in camps.

What you need and what you don't.

With the numbers she needed to know more or less cemented in her head, Charlotte did the following.

In a way, it's even more important than memorizing numbers.

Whether the number you remembered was correct.

There are cases where there is a reported abundance, but in reality there is not enough.

This is often higher than the actual number recorded.

Usually those numbers are tweaked a bit in the middle.

And it was Charlotte's job to figure out why the numbers were different.

Charlotte sits on her throne and stares at the man on his knees, surrounded by guards.

"Explain the difference between the amount of fish received and the amount shipped for the production of fish paste."

Charlotte never thought she'd be interrogating the manager of a dried fish plant in her lifetime.

But Edina's most important business and issue is food.

Food is a matter of life and death.

The fish and shellfish that the mermaids collect are a very important and vital food resource, and the process of making fish into canned food is one of Edina's most important food initiatives because it creates long-term preservation for the winter.

There is a difference between the amount of fish received and the amount of fish paste produced.

In front of Charlotte's eyes was the person in charge of the production process for the apo.

"I, Your Highness......."

"Let them be called regents."

The terrified rep looked into Charlotte's red eyes and slammed his head into the ground in fear.

"Sir, Your Excellency the Regent....... Basically, not all of the fish that are brought into the fishery for production are finished in the fishery manufacturing process. A significant amount is lost in the interim due to mistakes or errors made by field workers, so the yield is not actually very high......."

"Does this mean the yield is low?"

"Yes, for example......."

"What is the loss rate?"

"That, that......."

"If you're the person in charge of the production of apos, you should know something about the average value of yield. Don't you know?"

I don't know what I need to know.

Even if they didn't actually steal it, not knowing what you need to know is already a sin.

"The actual yield is around 8, so......."

"That can't be right. If we calculate the incoming and outgoing, the average actual yield is less than 6%. That means we're losing about 4% of the fish."

At the false report, Charlotte stares calmly at her handler.

"If there was a mistake about the actual numbers, that's a sin in itself. The issue of preserved food is a very important state project in terms of food for the winter. If the person in charge does not know the actual situation, it is a serious dereliction of duty. Also, if 4% of the business has to disappear, there must be a technical problem. But there hasn't been a single report on the need to improve or raise technical issues. Are you just doing what you're told and don't understand the purpose of this?"

"There you go, Mr. President....... But....... Things happen in the field, so....... inevitably....... that......."

"Inevitable what?"

Charlotte tilts her head slightly.

"We've already seen your stolen Apo circulating on the Razak black market. Let's see what other excuses you have."

"Go, Your Excellency, go, Lord, Lord...... is guilty of death!"

Charlotte smiled as she watched the pale-faced representative slam his head into the floor of the realm.

"False."

"......Yes?"

"I don't have to do anything to find out if you're a marketplace apo distributor or not, I'm just saying."

Charlotte smiles at the frozen rep.

"I poke him once, and he comes clean."

Charlotte glares at the guards.

"Investigate this man's crimes and execute him publicly. If there are other crimes, find them as well, and if they are discovered after you have been executed, I will execute your wife and children. So, if you want to save the rest of your family's lives, tell the truth."

"Go, Your Excellency! Go, forgive me!"

"Drag him away."

Charlotte watched as the Apo production line manager was dragged away by the guards.

Sin happens everywhere.

Charlotte doesn't wonder why the author sinned.

It could be for a good reason, or it could just be selfishness.

But once you start making extenuating circumstances, the list is endless.

So Charlotte didn't even know about it.

"Sir....... Regent......."

One of the vassals who had remained silent at Charlotte's decision spoke up cautiously.

"Speak."

One of the vassals squirms, as if unable to meet Charlotte's gaze.

"His Majesty the Demon King is inherently....... When dealing with sin, he did not discuss the idea of a sit-in......."

"Oh....... Is that what you mean?"

Reinhard's Rise to Power.

Charlotte has some idea of what that was like.

Rather than kill them, they used them for labor, and punished them for the most heinous crimes.

Even the punishment for those who attempted to assassinate the king was death, not punishment for their clan.

Leaving aside the question of mere right and wrong, Reinhardt's idea of punishment is punishment of the individual.

But Charlotte's idea of punishment is different.

To be a worker bee is to be a hundred.

Punishment is a tool of governance, not a matter of ethics.

"Didn't I tell you?"

Charlotte says in a frosty voice.

"It's going to be different, a lot different."

Sin and its punishment are meant to serve as a warning to society.

"I was delegated full authority over Edina's internal affairs. And I've been given maximum autonomy in that regard."

"So, if I'm going to punish, I'm going to punish."

"If I say I'm going to sit down, I'm going to do it."

"Food, in particular, is a business that touches the lives of everyone in Edina."

"For the people in charge of that business to pocket the profits in the middle is a felony that shakes the foundations of Edina."

"Edina has a lot of mouths to feed."

"Too many."

"Therefore, I intend to reduce as much as possible the number of unscrupulous mouths that suck the lifeblood of the nation."

"Going forward, anyone caught pursuing this kind of self-interest in Edina's food business, regardless of affiliation, will be publicly executed, no exceptions, and his clan will be disposed of as well, no exceptions."

Charlotte watches the vassals flinch.

There are demons among the vassals. But the demons are unabashed in their absolute trust in the King.

The terrified were all human.

"If it's clean, there's nothing to be afraid of, so there must be some people whose fears are well-founded."

Charlotte sits on her throne, chin on her arm, surveying the faces of her vassals.

"Pray to the gods that your uncleanness may not be found in my sight."

You're not the only one who dies, you can take things you care about with you.

The reign of the Bitten Demon is over. The Regent will see plenty of blood to keep Edina disciplined.

Those who have been lining their own pockets with complacency are going to have to make a pretty big commitment to do so in the future.



* * *



"About the sit-in, see....... Reinhardt might not like that."

Charlotte nodded at Harriet's words.

"Perhaps, but your reign has been overly benevolent."

"......."

Charlotte's reign as regent was different, but too different.

She was afraid of what Reinhardt would think when he returned, not knowing where he was headed.

I wonder if Reinhard knew this would happen and gave Charlotte the regency.

Herriot couldn't tell.

"Even the lowest level officials are looking down their noses at the royal family and siphoning off supplies. Those who know know. that the Demon King is actually quite merciful. And a benevolent monarch is more likely to be perceived as a joke. It's time to get rid of that, pull out the rotten roots that aren't doing the country any favors. No, burn them in front of a crowd."

In fact, Charlotte once tried to keep the empire together by burning herself in front of a crowd.

Charlotte had a point, so Harriet didn't chime in.

"Anyway, the sit-in is for show, it's not something I'd actually do that often. I'll show you a few times and you'll get the hang of it, but you need to know that if you get caught, you'll be pulled down to the studs of the house."

Killing people for show.

Even though Harriet is a princess, it's hard to watch Charlotte make such a cavalier decision.



* * *



It's been three days since Reinhardt left.

There were several public executions in the squares of Razak.

The accuser recited the crimes of the sinners, and the executioners struck their heads off.

The people knew that the way they were governed had changed and that the Regent had made the decision.

Rather than being afraid, people were cheering.

They are usually those who have misappropriated the treasury or committed unforgivable felonies. Therefore, the crowd thought they deserved to die.

Of course, there were also those who felt panicked and paid their taxes voluntarily.

Charlotte did not punish them with extreme punishment. She forgave them with whipping or scourging, and even tended to their wounds.

And we didn't retroactively punish those who had already been punished.

So Charlotte was reorganizing the country and establishing new principles and rules.

At the same time, we also kept an eye on Edina's overall health.

"......."

Charlotte stared at the list of numbers in front of her.

A forward base responsible for capturing survivors from the continent and sending them to Edina.

Port Mokna.

In a way, it was Reinhard's most important place. Liana de Granz, known to the people as the Brainiac, was in command.

The main force is Paladins of the Order, with a number of Mages as well.

It can never be overrun by a horde of monsters, and even Riana, a powerful psychic, can't bring it down.



[Fort Mokna Requested Supply List].



"Is there a problem with......?"

Sitting in her office, Charlotte narrowed her eyes at Harriet's question.

"Can you give me a list of all the supplies you've sent to Port Mokna so far?"

"Huh? Oh, okay, I'll look it up."

Harriet scrambled around in her office for a while, but soon returned with the documents Charlotte needed.

"And if you have any paperwork on the number of survivors who have made it from Fort Mokna to Edina so far, can you find it for me?"

"Yeah, okay."

Charlotte's words were like the most important document she'd ever seen, so Harriet was able to get it ready in no time.

Charlotte lists her stash requests by date.

Similarly, there were papers lined up next to him, organized by when and how many refugee ships arrived each day.

Charlotte stares at the papers.

Charlotte, who seems to be thinking about something, and Harriet, who looks on.

"You said Fort Mokna had a resident force of about two thousand?"

"Uh-huh. That's right, there's about fifteen hundred combat troops, plus a hundred and fifty men for this and that, and that's about two thousand, and that number hasn't fluctuated much."

"Hmmm."

Charlotte stares at the papers for a long time.

Herriot broke out in a cold sweat.

We don't know what Charlotte is thinking, but if there's a problem in Port Mokna, it's Riana's problem.

Despite this, Riana doesn't have any good feelings for Charlotte.

If Charlotte found any irregularities at Fort Mokna and tried to correct them, she would inevitably run afoul of Riana.

There was a very real possibility that this could be a bad thing.

"Is there a problem with......?"

"Yes, I have."

Charlotte nodded at Harriet's question.

"Port Mokna is asking for too many supplies. Not just this time, but all the time, especially food."

By Charlotte's calculations, Port Mokna is overly eager for food supplies, and in fact, Edina has been supplying Port Mokna with just as much.

Charlotte noticed that there was something odd about the numbers.
