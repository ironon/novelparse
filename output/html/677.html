            Episode 677.





The Alliance is a giant beast.

Its very existence requires a huge supply of supplies every day.

So when you've served your purpose, it's best to disband as quickly as possible, and fortunately, Herriot's presence allows us to do so in the shortest amount of time.

It has several effects.

Scatter humanity's remaining reserves across the continents, making it impossible for them to band together.

Herriot's power is to send legions, so while they can't attack us, we can attack them with an army.

It divides humanity, and then exerts its influence on each of them.

We are too powerful an enemy to resist, and even if we had the intention to push back, we can't make it happen.

This strengthens the effectiveness of the domination.

After gaining their loyalty, disband the coalition.

Soldiers will be happy to know that they can return home without a long march.

And just knowing that it was the devil who made it possible for me to go back will have some positive effect.

Of course, you can't please everyone.

Fragmentation will happen, and the precursors are all over the place.

But first, there's something you need to do to disband the coalition.

Commander-in-Chief Barracks.

Sitting to my left was Charlotte and to my right was Olivia Ranze.

Heir to the empire and now my left arm.

The symbol of the Order of the Lord and my right arm.

And before me sat representatives of every remaining group of humanity.

"Good morning, everyone."

I say, looking at the still, frozen figure.

In this moment, as I sit here, no one can resist me, even though they may cast uncomfortable and fearful glances at me.

You can't even get out of your seat.

"It is I, Bali the Demon."

This sight means that I am already the ruler of the continent.



* * *



Up until this point, Charlotte had taken over my role, so they knew that the demonic domination had begun, but when they saw me as a demon, they seemed to recognize that everything had truly fallen into his hands.

There were tons of people sitting there who had already decided to be on my side.

Louise von Schwarz of Cernstadt, who spearheaded the effort, was seated near the head of the table, and of course Lowen, the head of the Crusader Knights.

Not surprisingly, the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan was there.

Funnily enough, his seat, which was originally near the end of the line, is now near the top.

Since his daughter had sided with the devil, he had been relegated to the lowest of the low, and certainly not by choice.

But now that her daughter has sided with the devil, she sits near the top of the throne. She, too, will be irrelevant to the will of the Grand Duke of St. Thuan.

From a traitor to humanity to an apologist for a new empire.

The Grand Duke of St. Thuan's stern expression showed that he had no interest in his new position.

What to say.

He's like a big brother to me.

It's like you're living in a place that's disconnected from the rest of the world.

She's an idiot.

He's also a weirdo.

In fact, when I was knocked out, the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan was the first to find and embrace Herriot.

Anyway, many of the delegates in this room decided to side with me even before the war was over.

Louise von Schwarz stepped into the role.

The Imperial troops in the Alliance are already in our hands. Of course, the Emperor is not the only one here, as there are quite a few Imperial commanders.

They had already turned their backs on the Empire because of the tremendous betrayal at the Battle of Diane.

And Charlotte finished the process of recruiting all the officers and commanders of the Imperial Army.

They're not already an imperial army.

"The Gradias Empire will cease to exist, and the continent belongs to me from now on."

"I don't want it to be taken in a tyrannical, rigid way, that it's a relationship of absolute dominance and loyalty."

"Yeah."

"Think of it as a 'promise.'"

"When you need me, I will help you."

"So, you guys help me when I need you."

"It's not going to change much."

"The point is, there are still monsters on the continent."

"It would take an incalculable amount of time and money to rebuild a ruined civilization."

"Of course, the chasm of distrust and resentment that you have built up against me is too deep, and we are not even of the same race."

"So whatever you're thinking inside, it's not something I can control."

"The first thing you need to do is not be overly loyal to me, not to give me anything."

"Each in their place, each doing their best for themselves."

"The rebuilding of civilization, the restoration of shattered livelihoods."

"That's the task you'll have to fulfill before your loyalty to me."

"You don't have to try to give me something."

"I'm not going to force them to take it."

"Just, accept me."

"And most of all."

"Live well."

"That's the best loyalty you can give."

They're not the ones who can give me something.

Go your separate ways and live happily ever after.

Rebuilding a crumbling civilization, standing up.

My goal is to rebuild and revive a shattered civilization. Therefore, the loyalty they can give is not to a few pennies in tribute, but to rebuilding a foundation upon which they can stand on their own two feet.

What horrible words did I expect to hear from the mouth of the Devil himself?

You're all fucked now.

I'll give you back what I got.

Or that foolish humanity will now pay the price of defeat.

Or that if you defy me, there will be bloody vengeance.

I've been waiting for that to happen.

But when I told them to live in their own place, they looked puzzled.

"Don't think this is an easy command."

"In these desperate times, I am giving you the hardest command of all."

To live well.

Is it easy?

For people who have to live in a broken world, it's actually the hardest thing to do.

In a world where monsters still roam and much of civilization has been destroyed, living well is the most unruly command.

I added, and everyone's faces darkened as they thought about how to live well.

In fact, I think I finally understood that this was the harshest and most difficult challenge.

We're all tired of talking about death and blood.

I need not warn you of those who do not serve me, of those who have betrayed me.

It's never too late to discuss such things after the fact.

"I said I'd help you guys."

It's a good day.

"I'll give you the first one I can give you."

The war is over.

"For now, everyone, go home."

Let's go home, wipe our feet, and rest.

No one is exempt.



* * *



Not everyone was surprised to hear that the Allies were preparing to withdraw as soon as their forces were cleaned up.

This is because it was seen as a procedure for withdrawal, returning to the ecliptic, and similar things before occupation.

But when I explained that the withdrawal I was referring to was literally the withdrawal itself, their faces turned puzzled.

Their jaws dropped when I told them that they could be instantly transported to their hometowns.

They can return to their respective hometowns in just one day.

Many people have lost their homes, but everyone has a place to go back to.

And it's not just the soldiers who want to go home.

They all looked like they'd been slapped in the face in their sleep.

You don't even have to fight an empire.

You can just go back to the way things are.

From there, you just live.

They're shocked that that's the price of accepting my dominance.

No, this is not a prize.

The sweet fruits of accepting the Devil's rule.

It's a price so sweet that you have to wonder if it's a poisoned chalice.

"I told you. Go back and mind your own business. But there are no more supplies to feed you. It won't be easy to survive on your own."

It's no small feat.

Suddenly, everyone seems to realize that going home is not always a good thing.

"There is nothing more to say. Prepare to withdraw as soon as you're ready, and report to me when you're ready, and I'll send you back at once."

Some of the people sitting there looked determined.

I saw the looks on their faces as if they were preparing to say something extraordinary and were willing to die on the spot.

There were definitely some people who wanted to call it a dirty trick.

But I can't bring myself to open my mouth because of the implications of my words.

He was so overwhelmed by the idea of being able to go back immediately that he seemed to forget what he was trying to say.

The bewildered looks were quite refreshing.

"Go back, live well."

That is the first edict of the new continental emperor.

But then one of them raised his hand.

"I....... Devil......."

I don't know who it is.

"What is it?"

He looked dumbfounded.

"If the Allies withdraw....... How will you take over the Empire....... Do you think......."

Given that he's wondering if it's possible with only the remaining Imperial and Demon armies, I'm guessing he's probably in favor of me.

Empire Takeover.

"Do you mind if I talk about that?"

Before I can say anything, Rowen speaks up.

"The emperor, they say, has already fled."

I've heard this before.

But the emperor has fled.

With those words, the last of the Empire's loyalists, if there were any left, were gone.

The throne is empty, the palace is empty.

We just need to enter that empty palace.



* * *



Bertus slowly regained consciousness as the carriage rocked at a steady pace.

"......!"

In the darkness of the carriage, Bertus jumped to his feet.

Where am I.

My whole body felt as heavy as a soaked cotton ball.

I don't even know how long I've been asleep.

They're just in a dark carriage, going somewhere.

Bertus stumbles over his last memory.

The battle of Diane is over.

So Bertus prepared.

Prepare to be the last emperor of the fading Gradias Empire.

Betrayed humanity, the cause of it all, ready to pay the price.

We need an offering for the new age.

Thus, empires are a manifestation of hatred, and they die with the emperor, who is an absolute evil.

With the Emperor, the true source of all evil, hanging from a pole, all hatred should be burned away and a new era should dawn.

So it's been a buildup.

With that, Bertus was ready to go.

Prepare to hand over everything to the new power.

And, the posture of one who deserves to die.

However, Saviolin Tana is back.

Bertus's order didn't end with blowing up the basement of a magical college.

After that, he doesn't have to listen to my commands anymore.

Now you're not my article.

Don't come back, stay alive.

The empire will cease to exist, and stop being a knight in shining armor.

Live by your will.

And so it was ordered that she break the oaths of loyalty that bound her.

However, Savior Tana returned a few days after the battle of Diane.

"Lord Tana......?

The knight who was told not to return, returned and put the emperor to sleep.

"I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

That faint voice was the last thing I remembered.

In the dimly lit carriage, Bertus groped for himself.

He had a change of clothes.

His clothes, in the dim light, certainly didn't look very classy.

-Thump!

After a few taps on the coachman's side of the carriage, it stopped with a slight rattle.

Soon, there was movement from the stallion's side.

-click!

When the door opened, there it was.

"Your Majesty."

"Lord Tana......."

There was the face of Saviolin Tana.

"Is this....... What is this?"

I said live free, you said survive.

The emperor's knight had the audacity to kidnap the emperor.

Saviolin Tana knew what she had done, and she looked devastated.

"This is....... This can't be, this shouldn't be."

Tana must have known what Bertus was up to. Even if the emperor didn't tell her, she knew what he was doing and what he was preparing.

The emperor has dug his grave.

Now we just need to get in there.

The moment was right around the corner, and I'd already made up my mind.

We are ready for a new era that must be ushered in by embracing the sins of all and putting the expression of evil to death.

At the last minute, Saviolin Tana's behavior threw off all our calculations.

Bertus had no idea how far the carriage had come or where it was headed.

The plain clothes, the unadorned carriage, the lack of fancy, made me realize what Saviolin Tana was up to.

"I need to go back."

It was time for that, and all the plotting and scheming to make it happen.

"Why do you have to, do you have to?"

Finally, tears form in her eyes.

"I have to die. Someone has to be responsible."

The death of an emperor does not extinguish all hatred, nor does it erase all sin.

But it will go away, at least a little.

If everyone blames the emperor, and the emperor, the symbol of that blame, must die, then fewer people will blame the new era.

"That is not courage, Your Majesty."

"......."

Very young.

The knight he's known since he was a baby, the knight he sometimes played with as a child, finally bursts into tears the likes of which Bertus has never seen in his life.

"That's running away, too."

It's about leaving the world to someone else and running away with death.

I've paid my dues, you say.

To die content, after all, is not to take responsibility, but to avoid responsibility.

"You have the courage to die, but not the courage to run away ugly and live? Why....... Why do you have to?"

Death isn't the end of the world.

Death doesn't solve everything.

Why try to die.

Isn't it courageous to endure the ugly, dirty life of a fugitive?

After all, isn't Bertus' desire for death a way for him to find his own honor?

If you try to find your own comfort in dying under false pretenses.

Why not really live the life of a cowardly, dirty fugitive.

It's better to survive real dishonor than to find fake honor.

"Lord Tana....... I am....... I don't want to do that, I'm......."

-Hair

Saviolin Tana ends up on her knees, headbutted.

Bertus has always been a loyal knight, but this is the first time he's ever seen him throw himself on his knees.

Even if she is a goddess, she has her moments.

Even the Emperor didn't dare to ask her to do this, even to the point of bowing her head to the ground.

Then she puts her head down and sobs.

"Please....... Please......."

"My whole life, I've been doing what I'm told."

"They say loyalty doesn't pay."

"This Saviolin Tana. The Emperor's Sword."

"For this loyalty, for dedicating my life to the Empire, I would like to be rewarded... not paid."

"Your Majesty."

"Please live."

"It may be an ugly life, but it's the life of a coward."

"May you live."

"That's the....... this god wants to receive is the only recompense......."

"Didn't you tell me to bend to your will now?"

"This is my will......."

Bertus stares, wide-eyed, at his knight, who is not on his knees, but on his stomach, weeping.

He has devoted his life to the sword, his life to the empire.

A woman who has lived her entire life for the sake of the empire itself.

Even before Bertus was born, she was a knight of the Empire.

No, she was a knight of the empire even before the first emperor was born.

She didn't want something from the Empire.

She is the oldest loyalist of the empire, the one who has served the empire the longest, and the one who has been closest to the imperial family.

We've done the dirty work, and we've done the necessary work.

I've lived that way without a name.

It is a knightly virtue that loyalty has no price.

If she is.

For someone who's been around as long as she has.

You're probably entitled to ask for something in return.

I'm even afraid to use the word quid pro quo, so I say reciprocation.

I want only one thing in return for my loyalty.

Be alive.

"Please....... Your Majesty....... Please......."

A cowardly life.

The last emperor who betrayed humanity should hang from a pole. Or is it better to run away and be alive somewhere.

It was impossible to focus hatred on a dead demon.

When Bertus realized that there was a surviving heir to the demon world, he was overjoyed.

I said that, not realizing that I was speaking to the heir of a demon.

The presence of a demon is actually necessary for the consolidation and maintenance of an empire.

The last demon is alive somewhere.

That alone made people tremble with fear and put all their hopes in the empire.

The empire concentrated all of humanity's power in such a way.

You've used the devil as a symbol of hate.

Is it time for the emperor to step into that role?

The life of a fugitive, a cowardly, ugly loser.

Rather than the reality that the emperor is dead, the reality is that the emperor has fled.

Better for a new era.

Bertus didn't know.

However.

Your article is being misread.

A man who lived his whole life for an empire.

Now he's lost his empire, and he's begging for his life, desperate to save the last remnant of it, the Emperor.

Bertus clenched his teeth, and the viola tuned to a desperate tune.

The last knight of the Imperial House of Gradias stood there, unable to capture or even strike.
