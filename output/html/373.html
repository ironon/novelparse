            Episode 373.





There are two people in this world who are exceptions to the norm. Ellen, the talented vending machine, and me, the cheat.

but it's actually three.

I had to include the main character, Ludwig.

"......."

"......."

Ellen, myself, and Klippmann stared at Ludwig, who was sleeping peacefully in the rest room behind the on-call chaplain's office.

I know what this feels like.

He's asleep as an aftereffect of his enchantment.

"Ah, hi. You're here."

Delphine, who was nursing Ludwig's side, looked at us and tilted her head.

Ludwig's condition seemed to be fine; the yoga master teacher, who is the equivalent of a therapist in this situation, had already been there.

Or someone who doesn't have to be a master yoga teacher to do something like that.

Saviolin Tana was also sitting next to Ludwig.

"During last night's duel, Ludwig used a magical enhancement."

She said tersely.

Cliffman reached out to us today for a reason.

He knows he's being impatient, and he understands that Ellen and I are the exceptions to the rule.

But when he told me that as of yesterday, he had enchanted Ludwig with magic, I wondered if there was something really wrong with him, so I asked for a consultation.

"I was muttering something about not having enough time, or not being able to do this, or whatever, and then suddenly, I got an enchantment that made me....... I can't help but be surprised......."

Ludwig had apparently said at Duke Granz's funeral that he could not forgive the demons.

I could see that Chuck was very angry.

He's outraged that his classmate's parents were killed by a demon, and like Klippmann, he's come to believe that fighting demons is a problem that could happen at any time, not in the distant future.

So, the urgency in his heart created a very strong desire for strength, and the world responded by granting Ludwig a new path: enchantment.

Saviolin Tana seemed deeply shaken by what she had witnessed. She'd only heard about me and Ellen's magical enhancements, but in Ludwig's case, she'd seen them firsthand.

She must have been impressed, because she'd seen him work tirelessly to get to the next level.

And Cliffman.

Even Ludwig manages to enchant himself, so if he can't, it's probably because he doesn't have the right vessel.

"umm......."

"Hey, are you up?"

Ludwig whimpered and stirred, and Delphine searched his complexion.

No.

Stay in bed for a few more days!

I'd be a little self-conscious if I woke up in a day!

"Ugh....... Hmm."

Luckily, he didn't wake up one day and unwittingly stir up my self-consciousness.

Grow some more.

He's the main character, so I'll let him get away with waking up a day earlier than me.

a.

I'm thinking the same thing.

It's no wonder Cliff's ego is all he's got right now.

Ellen and I stared blankly at Ludwig, who was stirring but otherwise sound asleep and unable to wake up, and our gaze naturally shifted to Klippmann.

I feel like Ellen and I have become twins.

I'm useless.

I'm worthless.

I'm a dork.

帮助?

Me?

I need a room.

Garbage that doesn't even enchant.

I'm garbage.

Garbage needs to die.

"......."

"......."

Watching the pessimism on his face go from mild self-loathing to self-pity was almost unbearable.

"Let's go do something."

Ellen says with a calm expression.

And.



[Event Occurrence - Enchantment (Cliffman)]

[Description: Help Cliffman awaken to the power of magic].

[Reward: 2,000 Achievement Points, increased sensitivity to enchantments].



event has occurred.

Achievement Points.

I'll give you a chance to build it up since you used it so much last time.

Achievement points are always a last resort.

Plus disenchantment sensitivity.

In fact, this may be more important. Because you have to get good at enchanting and reach the master class at some point.

"Yeah, why wouldn't you?"

Ellen and I had no choice but to reverse our attitudes.

"......Yes."

If you don't do this as a reward or as a favor, I'm going to do something about it!

Of course, Delphine and Saviolin Tana had no idea what we were talking about in front of a stunned Ludwig.

Eventually.

It wasn't until we were back on the stage that we realized that all three of us were trashy in that we weren't at all concerned about Ludwig passing out.



* * *



Cliffman needs a disenchantment boost.

But trying to pull strings on disenchantment when you don't have a clue is like trying to touch an elephant when you're blind, and you'll only get pooped on if you try hard enough.

So I spent a couple hours next to Kliffman, who couldn't do it, telling me to do this, that, and the other.

The result is a weird picture of Ellen and I bickering, with only Cliff having a clue.

"No, you have to do it in the sense of feeling the essence of your body."

"Integers? Can you explain what an integer is?"

"It's horsepower or essence or whatever."

"That's what you do when you can just do whatever you want. For people like me and him, you have to make it clear and organized. How else am I supposed to understand something that's already vague if you explain it in even more vague terms?"

"Can you explain it systematically?"

"No, not at all."

"......Why are you so proud?"

"You're a genius at this stuff, you should explain it to me, it's not my job."

"There's a difference between doing it and teaching it."

"No, you're good at teaching. You're good at everything, so you must be good at teaching. What's wrong with not trying? Why don't you try to teach well?"

"There's something I can't do."

"No, I told you, you'd be good at everything if you tried, so use your brain to teach well. Why don't you use your good brain, you dumbass?"

"......I'm not a paktong."

How much?

Good one.

"Huh? So who's the dick if not you?"

Ellen's complexion turned white at my words.

"No, that's not what I meant......."

"This is not you, uh."

"No, I didn't think of that, I just said I wasn't a dick."

"Really? Then who's the dick? Tell me."

"No. I don't think so."

"I thought you were someone else, not me. Tell me what you really think. Tell me what you really think!"

-Fast!

I held my breath as Ellen seemed genuinely annoyed.

"I'm the boss."

"I know."

One more scratch and I would have been hit.

Anyway, it's starting to sound like it has nothing to do with enchantment.

"Hey, guys, guys....... I think I'm going to bleed out of my ears, not my mouth......."

We gulped and stared at Cliff as he pleaded that if there was a problem with the enchantment, he'd have to take a bloodletting, which would only make his ears bleed.

Naturally.

Nothing really happened.



* * *



Ellen is right when she says that doing is not the same as teaching.

Ellen or Nana.

It's clear that I'm not very good at teaching, and enchantments are particularly difficult to teach, so it was inevitable that I wouldn't make any progress.

It's kind of weird when you're enchanted because you're screaming in your ear in the first place.

So disenchantment was on the back burner and I was back to training.

I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but it does give you a sense of awareness that you're doing something.

-Billion!

"Poof!"

Only Cliff, who was struck by my sword, fell backwards into the distance.

"Ha ha....... Ha ha......."

He staggers to his feet, exhausted.

"It's not my place to say, but beating yourself up doesn't necessarily make you better."

He nodded at my words, watching only Cliff stagger to his feet.

"Still, I have to do it."

"......."

Enchantment is the last thing you want to do because you don't know what you're doing.

Assuming I was using enchantments, Cliffman was no match for me.

My swordsmanship has improved greatly due to what I've learned from Ellen, and I've already realized magic control.

Cliffman is no match for my extremely reliable enchantments. No, technically, even with no enchantments and just Self-Suggestion, Cliffman can now be dealt with.

Cliffman is no longer my opponent, unless I seal up some means, like an off-loading organ.

In a purely sword fight, I lose.

But that kind of innocence works in a fight.

If I had faced Leviathan alone, I would have fought a hundred times and died a hundred times.

But the Reverie Rancher is dead to me.

That's what fighting is all about.

You can threaten or be threatened.

It's a dichotomy where the one who ends up dead is the loser, and the one who survives is the winner. The only definition of a fight is winning.

I didn't say anything like that.

Rather, only Cliff wanted this.

Give it your all.

Otherwise, there's no point.

Cliffman agrees to help Riana in her quest to kill the demon. But he doesn't have the power to do it himself, so he wants to make sure he has the minimum requirements to do so.

Riana was a very powerful psychic before her abilities suddenly exploded. Her abilities had naturally increased to the point where they were nowhere near what they were on the desert island.

Even if she realizes the enchantment, she'll need to practice it for a while before it can help her.

Of course, there's no telling what will happen to Klippmann and Riana when the fight actually starts to unfold in front of them, and they start to dip their toes in the water.

However, just as Riana exercises to boost her weak stamina.

Kliffman, who teaches Riana to exercise, is also eager for the next step. He knew he could help Riana, but he couldn't truly help her.

Like Ellen.

Like me.

Like Ludwig.

We want to take the next step: disenchantment.

We want a guy who doesn't qualify for an exception to become one.

"I'll be there."

The picture sucked.

-Kaang! kang! kang! Kakak!

-Bam!

"Ahem!"

He misses the sword, and all he sees is Cliff getting up.

I'm doing this for my own reasons that these guys don't know about.

After all, I'm helping someone who is training to kill me.

I don't know about anyone else, but at least I shouldn't be helping him.

Ellen has the mindset that she's taking on the devil.

However, Cliffman and Riana have a clear goal: to kill the demon.

We don't know how vindictive Riana is, but we can't underestimate Cliff's desire to help her.

Like Ellen said she could die for me.

Cliff's not the only one who can think that way.

They can't reach the enchantment, so they bump into each other.

Cliffman keeps falling down and getting up, as if he's being held up by some evil force.

As if that would make it something.

I'm done with that.

Because a guy named Ludwig did it.

Just like I believe I can do it.

Like believing that if you don't get knocked down, something will get done.

I watch as Cliff gets to his feet, his legs shaking with exhaustion.

"You're not supposed to do that."

And only Ellen, watching from the sidelines, could restrain him.

As Ellen watched, Cliffman hung the water lance on its rack.

"I'm going to go visit the on-call chaplain."

"......."

If exhaustion is the problem, then you're not exhausted.

According to Adriana, this type of training is not very good. It's technically running on medication.

But because we are told to take our time and grow stronger, we all believe that the demonic threat can invade our daily lives at any time.

After being healed by a priest, Klippmann was in good shape.

Enchantments are a mystery.

All you can do is watch sword clash with sword.

It's not that he believes he'll get somewhere at the end of it, it's just that it's all he can do.

It's not weak, and it's not a dull talent.

However, the comparisons are so overwhelming that Kliffman finds himself paled in comparison.

"You shouldn't do that."

"It's okay."

Kliffman stares at me with a calm expression.

Ellen had been watching me and Kliffman duke it out.



* * *



-Kang! ka-kang! Kaduk!

-Billion!

"Boom!"

Ellen stared at Cliffman as he rolled on the floor.

I can't even count how many hours it's been, or how many times.

No match.

Reinhardt can enhance his combat abilities in two ways.

Once by self-suggestion and twice by enchantment.

Ellen doesn't go that far, but if she has Tiamata, she can be enhanced by three levels.

Ellen also sensed that Reinhardt's magical enhancement was much more stable than it had been before.

Even though I kept using Enchantment, my skill level was not much different than when I first started playing. It was as if the skill level of the enchantment itself had suddenly jumped. Over the course of several hours, Klippmann received several healings from the priest, but Reinhardt did not seek him out.

Reinhardt was used to doing weird things like suddenly becoming stronger, like vaulting, so this didn't seem strange to Ellen.

But.

Cliffman is no Reinhardt.

A bizarre superpower called self-suggestion is the source of Reinhardt's strange strength.

Klippmann has no such thing.

So, you can think you want to be as strong as Reinhardt, but you can't be.

If using evil made everyone stronger, the world would be littered with swordmasters, archmages, and psychics.

Ellen feels a sense of déjà vu as she watches Cliff lunge at her again and again.

Reinhardt stands like an iron wall, taking down Klippmann time and time again.

After being knocked down and knocked out, Klippmann gets back up and stands before Reinhardt.

You can see the superimposition of Klippmann's reflection on Reinhardt's and Reinhardt's reflection on Klippmann's.

Reinhardt, whose role had always been to get knocked down, suddenly found himself standing like an iron wall in front of someone.

Ellen can't deny it now.

-Ka-ching!

"Poof!"

Reinhardt is strong.

Indeed, in the past, Klippmann had always been in a position to bring Reinhardt to his knees. Somewhere along the line, the balance of power had shifted, and it seemed to be irreversible.

More than Ludwig feels a strange inferiority complex to Reinhard.

The core of Kliffman's inferiority complex is Reinhardt, not Ludwig, who suddenly realized his enchantment yesterday.

Ludwig has been watching Reinhardt's growth from afar, at least in the B class.

But Kliffman had been watching.

It's like going toe to toe, sword to sword, always winning, and then at some point you just can't win anymore.

Reinhardt has gone from being a one-fold opponent to a two-fold opponent to a three-fold opponent.

Cliffman was never lazy. He's always worked hard.

They both worked hard, but only Reinhardt got stronger quickly. Sure, Klippmann would have gotten stronger, but Reinhardt was too fast.

Klippmann had to watch from the sidelines as a runner who had started far behind him was nowhere to be seen.

The good thing about Cliff is that he doesn't translate that inferiority complex into malice and hate.

In no way, shape, or form can inferiority complexes not exist.

-Ka-ching!

"Boom!"

From the position of being knocked down to being knocked out, Kliffman is knocked down, knocked over, knocked down, and knocked out again and again by the opponent he once toyed with.

"Ha ha....... Ha ha......."

Reinhardt knew what Klippmann was feeling, and he could never be at ease.

At least that's how it seemed to Ellen. Still, Reinhardt was in no mood to pity Cliff.

Pity is the last thing Cliff needs right now.

When the person in front of you gives you a pity party, it's a sign that you'll never get ahead.

At least Reinhardt didn't pity Cliffman.

I've been told to give it my all, but I'm only dealing with Cliff.

But eventually.

At this point, Klippmann was no match for Reinhardt.

Just as Ellen was an insurmountable wall to Reinhard, Reinhard was now an insurmountable wall to someone else.

To Ludwig, who has just discovered enchantment, and to Klippmann, who can't even do that yet.

I became that wall, looking down at my fallen opponent, not the least bit tired.
