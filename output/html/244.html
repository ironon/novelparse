"Reinhard, what the hell is going on?"

Olivia didn't seem to understand that I was sponsored at all.

"She seems to know you, and you seem to know something....... She doesn't know what's what."

All of a sudden, we're trading like a bunch of pretzels, paraphrasing things that only we know.

What is the unique value of being a student at Temple, and why would Owen want to buy it?

"That's about right. What do you want to know?"

"To the West Winds!"

Olivia pretended to cry when I cut her off. I'd been on the sponsorship circuit for quite some time, but it wasn't because of the Institute of Magic or Olivia that I was sponsored, it was because of my work with the Rotary Club.

I didn't expect the Merchant Guild Master to be interested either, so I was basically stuck with it.

The problem.

I have a pledge of support, but I don't know how much. No matter how much I have, it's not enough. The more the merrier.

"After all, we need more, right?"

Olivia must have read those feelings in my expression.

"You never know how much you're going to get, and more is always better."

"Hmm....... Yeah. I knew it was going to be like this......."

Olivia seemed to have an idea.

I know it's going to be hard to get sponsored, but since you're here, it sounds like you have a plan.

What did Olivia come up with?

Owen sat alone again, and we sat at a secluded table and ate our food. There were many covetous eyes on Olivia, but no one approached her, knowing that she was an iron wall.

While Olivia was deep in thought, someone approached us.

"Number 11."

"Ah, sir."

Dr. Effinghauser approached.

"Greetings. Captain Shanapelle of the First Knights of the Empire. This is Lord Saviolin Tana."

Beside him was a knight with a sword-like stance, dressed in the regalia of the Imperial Knights.

Looking at her calm but piercing expression, I felt myself freezing under her gaze.





It's definitely while. I'm sure he's a lot older than you.

Of course, I've set it up so that superhumans who reach a certain level of enlightenment will age slower, and even rejuvenate.

In martial arts terms, it's a reincarnation. Violinist Tana is one of those people.

It was weird to see someone who was about to turn 60 looking like he could be a freshman at Temple right now.

"This is Reinhardt, A-11, first year, Temple Royal class."

"This is Olivia Ranze, A-0, fifth grade, Temple Royal class."

Olivia is number 0, right?

I was struck by a strange place.

She was paid, so she should have gotten her number back.

It should have gotten the last number, but given the talent ranking, that's not possible, so it got the number 0, which is not there.

Or not, Savior Tana stares at me.

"Are you the future of the empire?"

"......Yes?"

No.

EpinHauser What is he talking about?!

Mr. Effinghauser, who goes around saying I'm the future of the empire.

It's crazy in more ways than one.



* * *



Shanapelle's grooming. The best knight in the Empire. Saviolin Tana.

She held out her hand to me, and I took it. It was a hard, rough hand.

The Empire's strongest knight and defender of the imperial family. Saviolin Tana.

All the talent in the world pales in comparison to Ellen Artorius, but this man in front of her is a monster.

Right now, he's also the continental champion in Melee.

Saviolin Tana is a Temple senior at EpinHauser.

"I don't doubt your judgment, but I'm not so sure."

"I'm still in first grade."

An unfamiliar nickname for the future of the empire.

That's just Dr. Effinghauser's idea. Saviolin Tana seems to have gotten the quote from shaking my hand.

Still.

You're so dismissive of people right in front of you, is that all you are, a continental powerhouse?

I'm the strongest.

Still, it's a bit much when a young-looking Savior Tana talks back to an older-looking Mr. Effinghauser.

It feels weird.

Actually, Saviolin Tana is a cranky senior.

"I think this is the future of the empire."

Saviolin Tana looked at Olivia Ranze.

"......."

Olivia nodded in greeting, but looked at Xavier with a bit of wariness.

I kind of figured out that they were spheres.

The view that Olivia Lanchester is the future of empire. I'm not so sure.

Maybe, maybe not. In the original, Olivia Lanchester is someone who disappears into the margins of the story, so is she more than just Ellen or Ludwig in the second half?

Saviolin Tana looks at Olivia with a stern demeanor.

"Your offer is still valid. Olivia."

"......."

"If you won't take your place in the Crusaders, join the Shanapels."

The future of empires.

Saviolin Tana weighs in on Olivia Lanze. I can't help but feel the same way. She's got a lot to prove.

Olivia was once offered a place in the First Knights of the Empire, and by the looks of it, she declined. Olivia stares at Tana, the violinist.

He looks like he's made up his mind about something.

"How much can you give me?"

"...... money?"

"Yes."

Saviolin Tana narrowed her eyes slightly at that.

And then he looks at me.

"Oh, I see."

I felt like my brain was shutting down.

"If you promise to join, I can pay up to 10,000 platinum coins."

10,000 platinum coins.

One million in gold coins.

A trillion in today's dollars.

Superhuman is a tactical weapon.

As it is, it is already subject to asymmetric power treatment.

Are you saying that Olivia is already at that level, or do you think she can get there?

"I can invest that much in the future of the empire."

Olivia Ranze's ransom was more than a fighter in modern terms.

I realized I hadn't realized the value of Olivia Ranze.

A trillion is a lot of money, but isn't it a bargain when you can buy the next great empire, a tactical weapon they can't handle?

If a superhuman like that were to enter the Imperium instead of the Empire itself, that would be a problem. The Empire would want to stop that at all costs.

I realized why Olivia Lance said she knew it was going to be hard to get sponsored, but she said it would be easy once she got there.

She already knew who was going to buy her the most.

"Yes, that would be......."

"Wait. Wait."

But. I grabbed Olivia Ranze's arm.

"What are you trying to do?"

Olivia lowered her eyes, as if she'd known I'd come out like this.

"I thought you might be like this....... I didn't want to come with you."

For some reason, he didn't want me to come, and here's why.



* * *



I dragged Olivia out of the patronage hall. I didn't care about Dr. Effinghauser or the best knight in the empire.

"You said you were going alone for this?"

"......."

Olivia has her head down, not meeting my eyes. Olivia speaks without looking at me.

"Why, I'll have nothing to do when I graduate anyway, and they're paying me a lot of money, and I have nothing to spend it on, and you need the money, Reinhard, and that's that."

"I thought you weren't going to go?"

"......."

I'm sure she's gotten tons of offers here and there, but she's turned them all down. But when I told her I needed money, she suddenly wanted to pay me to join Chanapelle.

And he wants to give me the money.

"What am I supposed to do, save his life once? I mean, he paid me back last time, so why would he risk the rest of his life to do this?"

"......just. You can do it."

Olivia looked at me with difficulty. Her eyes are shaking.

"I don't know any other way to live."

It was the look of a man who had only learned to sacrifice, who had never known how to live for himself.

"If I can do something for the person who saved my life, I think I should, so I do, and it's not a bad thing."

I was thinking Olivia was a weirdo.

However, she was a really weird person. More like bizarre than weird.

She's the kind of person who thinks harder about other people's work than her own. She was weird the whole time, it's just that no one else thought it was weird.

Because Olivia Ranze is that kind of person.

For that reason, no one knew about her weirdness, not even me.

Raised to be the leader of the Crusader Knights and the symbol of the next High Priestess of the Five Kingdoms, it's unlikely she had an ordinary upbringing. Whatever her upbringing may have been, Olivia Ranze has been forced to live for the salvation of others rather than her own desires.

So I became that person.

The faith that underpinned it was gone, but the way of life remained.

Olivia Ranze was never good at living for herself.

Somehow, more like Lagan Artorius than Ellen. No, more than that.

If he had to die for the world, he would do it without a second thought.

There's only one reason.

Because you can.

Olivia looks at me with shaky eyes.

"I don't know what I want to do anymore, I don't have anything to do, I don't know what to live for, I could do anything, and if I can help you with it, I'm happy, that's all that matters."

Olivia Ranze, a human being, not a saint, was a broken human being.

In her life as a saint, she was flawless and had everything that was asked of her.

But Olivia Ranze, no longer a saint, has no idea how to live her life as an ordinary person.

10,000 platinum coins is an unimaginable amount of money.

That would solve all the funding problems.

But Olivia Lance didn't want to sell her future for the money.

"That's....... It's weird, you live your life first, and then there's everyone else. Why would you want to pay with your life for something so insignificant?"

"......."

"If it's just because I'm about to die, I can understand that. I mean, I know the grant is important, but it's not something you should have to do."

The real problem is this.

This is not something Olivia should be doing at all.

It's bizarre that he's willing to sell his future for something like that.

Olivia looks at me with a sad smile.

"So, you're going to tell me?"

"Is that ......?"

"How to live for yourself. Can you teach me?"

My tongue was stuck in my cheek.

"Are you living for yourself?"

"......."

"You, too, don't know the first thing about magic, and you're running around like this for the Hufflepuffs."

Olivia's words seemed to stab me in the heart.

"What's the difference between you and me?"

For the future. I'm not like you.

I wanted to say that, but my mouth wouldn't drop.

In the end, Olivia and I were both devoting our time and energy to a cause that had little to do with our own gain.

"I'm not as good as you."

"Yeah, I guess so."

Olivia looks up at the night sky, which seems to be bursting with stars.

"You're just as weird as I am."

There's no way I could argue with that. Olivia looks up at the night sky, then at me, her eyes slightly reddened.

"How to live for yourself....... with me?"

"......."

Looking into Olivia Ranze's eyes, which looked like they could burst into tears at any moment, I thought long and hard about what to say.

The answer was one.

"No dirty stuff."

"Gee, seriously, what do you think I am!"

Olivia blushed bright red at my ramblings and squealed.

"You reap what you sow, now what."

"Now, I was just kidding, I'm not me, I'm not me, I'm not that person!"

"What is such a person?"

"Hey, profit, I think I know why the kids hate you!"

Olivia sulked for a moment, genuinely upset.



* * *



Once we realized what Olivia's plan was, we didn't need to go back to the sponsor.

But nonetheless, we returned to the sponsorship venue.

If you're rude in front of the world's most powerful person and your homeroom teacher and don't apologize, it's going to come back to haunt you.

Of course, I'm not sure if I'm reading Xavier Tana's mind or Dr. Effinghauser's.

"Uh, excuse me."

Dr. Effinghauser didn't seem to mind, and Saviolin Tana just looked at me the way she had the first time.

But that first feeling was scary because it made me feel like I was being judged.

I can't tell if she's angry or not. Olivia stares at the World's Strongest, her eyes cold.

"Thanks for the suggestion, but I still think....... I think I'll have to give it some more thought."

"Okay, you have a lot of time, so take your time."

I'm sure Olivia Lance's demeanor has changed because of me.

Scary. How much would it hurt to get hit by the strongest person in the world?

She's got her eye on Olivia Lanchester, and she's probably got the imperial green light to spend unimaginable amounts of money.

Olivia Ranze.

He's a nice guy to me, but he's usually just a nosy senior who sticks around to the point of annoyance, so I'm not sure how powerful he is. When you're told you're the future of the empire by the strongest person in the world, you're pretty much done.

I can see why saving Olivia's life was a turning point in history.

Saviolin Tana stares at me.

"Did I mention I need a grant to study magic?"

"Yes."

"You're supposed to be a psychic, so why are you dabbling in magic?"

"You can think of it as letting my classmates focus on their research, while I do this outside work for them."

Savior Tana looked at me, then at Olivia, then back at me, and so on.

You seem to be very thoughtful.

I'm just making faces.

You look like a grown-up Ellen, man.

Someone who's a douchebag but actually has a cute side to them.

I don't think it's going to read, but I feel like I'm being a dick.

It's kind of like Dr. Unknowable Effinghauser, but not quite.

"Olivia said she's going to get him a grant so he'll join the organization.

"It's clear that Olivia takes Reinhardt very seriously.

"But she retracted her comments after Reinhardt took her out, so clearly Olivia is weak to Reinhardt.

'um.......'

'ugh.......'

"Then.

"If we sponsor Reinhardt, who has influence over Olivia, might it improve Chanapelle's impression of Olivia?

"So, as a result, isn't your support for Reinhardt a way to increase your influence over Olivia?

"Reinhard will have a positive attitude toward Schanapelle, and that will surely rub off on Olivia.

"I'm sure.

'Maybe.......'

'Oh dear me.......'

"Maybe a genius?

I've never met anyone more deceitful than Adelia.

I've gotten used to Ellen, and I can detect her emotional changes in her facial expressions and eyes, which go from blank to slightly changed.

Am I getting into the realm of solipsism here?

Saviolin Tana, deep in thought alone, sees me.

"I'll sponsor you."

"Gee, thanks!"

Again, I felt like I had a good idea of what I was thinking, if not all of it.

In the end, the presence of Olivia Ranze was enough to secure the sponsorship of the First Knights of the Empire.

Two of the core groups that participated in the fundraiser pledged their support.

It's more than I could have imagined.
