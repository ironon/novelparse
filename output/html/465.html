When he returned, Herriot was much more relaxed.

I could tell by the look on his face that he had finished his story.

"I could stay for a few days."

"No, it's okay, I'll be in trouble if they realize I'm back, so I'd better get going."

We don't know what they talked about, but we do know that the Archduke and his family understood Herriot.

The fortunes of the Duchy of St. Thuan are uncertain. It has failed to defend all of its cities outside of the capital.

So if we just move the people in this city, we'll be fine.

Arnaka is a finished city, and they don't know if they'll be able to make a life for themselves in Edina.

But if they can relocate to Edina, they may be able to escape the wrath of humanity that will one day befall them.

"I'm not sure how the Archduke would feel about that, but we could move all the people of Arnaka to Edina."

Her eyes widened at my words.

"But....... work?"

"The problem is that we don't have a way to do it right now, but it's something we could do if we had a way."

If you have a warp gate, you can make large-scale moves, but warp gates are currently disabled.

Physical travel is also impossible. No matter how skilled a wizard the Archduke was, there was no way he could lead an entire nation from the Duchy of St. Thuan in the northwest of the continent to Fort Mokna in the southernmost part of the continent.

Teleporting entire populations is obviously not an option, so it's out of the question.

"Nothing is going to happen to Arnaka right away, so let's figure out how to do it later."

"......Yes. Okay."

They have enough on their plate just dealing with the Gate situation. So it's unlikely that anything will happen to the Duchy of Saint-Ouen or the Grand Duke right away.

Relocating the people of the Duchy of Saint-Thuan to Edina after the Gate debacle.

I could almost feel the last shade of color drain from Herriot's face at my words.



* * *



Reunited with her family after so many years, with a good story to tell, and with the idea that she might be able to save the people of Arnaka, Harriet was more energized than ever.

Back in Edina, Herriot's face was much brighter.

"After the gate debacle is over, I wonder if we can improve the warp gate even further than it already is and create a gate that directly connects Arnaka to the Edina Archipelago?"

"I wish I could do that, but....... No, I'm sure you can do it."

"Yeah, let's make sure it doesn't."

Needless to say, it's nice to see them so energized.

He didn't seem to be depressed or struggling, he just didn't show it like everyone else did.

I couldn't help but be cheered up by his newfound vigor.

I never thought that Heriot's work on the warp gate at my request would come in handy in this way, but as it turns out, his research may be the way to save his people back home.

This would be after the destruction of the warp gates across the continent, but Herriot had begun to prepare a blueprint for what was to come.

Of course, it just meant more work for her to do, which made her already busy life even busier, but at the end of the day, she was saving people, even her family, so why not?

It made sense for her to get serious about it, as it would release the guilt and self-blame she'd been hiding for two years.

It was only natural for me to continue doing what I had to do, with Herriot being Herriot and me being me.



* * *



It's been about a month since I've been to Arnaka.

The complete end of the Gate debacle was only going to get longer and longer.

This is because the warp gates were unleashing increasingly stronger monsters as a unit, as well as stronger defenses, so we had to be increasingly cautious about destroying them one by one.

Eleris was no longer able to destroy the Warp Gates on her own, and it was no wonder that the Empire was finding it increasingly difficult for Savior Tana's forces to destroy them.

As the number of warp gates decreases, the remaining warp gates are destroyed at a slower rate, causing more casualties.

With the end of the world so close, yet so far away, things are starting to happen that are independent of the Gate incident.

"Great One. I have word that the Empress is about to be executed."

"......."

And I was forced to face what was bound to come at some point.

"Why?"

Bertus hasn't answered the crowd's demands so far, so I'm assuming he has enough willpower to protect Charlotte.

"Is it because of the last time I showed up on the ecliptic?"

If the crowd's anxiety has exploded and I can no longer ignore their demands, then I'm the one who started it all.

At my words, Antirrhinus smiled wryly.

"I can't say that's the cause, but it's not the crowds that matter, it's the demands of the imperial powers and the Five Great Houses that seem to be irresistible."

"......."

"They are demanding that the empress be used as a scapegoat to stabilize the country."

The unstable empire is also faced with the demands of the vassal states and the pressures of the Five Great Houses.

The Principalities are the most important members of the Empire, and the Five Great Houses are a powerful force to be reckoned with, even if their support among the populace has waned. The Empire cannot afford to ignore them.

They act like the gate is already closed when it's not.

The Five Great Houses want to dilute the hatred against them by pointing the finger of blame at the Empress, while the Imperial Houses want to eliminate the destabilizing factor of the Empress to confirm their allegiance to the crumbling empire.

So I reluctantly said yes.

"So Emperor Bertus decided to execute her three weeks later, at noon on a Sunday, in the Great Square of the Zodiac."

"......."

Bertus eventually had to make the choice to trade the empire for Charlotte.

But Antirrhinus was still smiling.

"And to top it all off, we've decided to execute the Lord Vampire and Lord Sarkegar together."

"......what?"

"It's exactly what you heard."

No.

Charlotte is one thing, but executing them together?

Did Bertus forget my warning after two years?

Don't you realize that if you mess with Rusinil and Sarkegar, I'll be your enemy?

Antirrhinus was still chuckling, as if he found the situation too amusing.

Because of that unnervingly amused expression, I realized what this embarrassing and unpleasant situation meant.

Three weeks.

That's a long time.

It's a laid-back time, maybe too laid-back.

Bertus will know that I appeared on the ecliptic not long ago.

Soon, you'll intuit that I'm looking at the ecliptic from wherever I am.

I'm not trying to kill Charlotte.

Rusinil and Sarkegar hang on.

That fact speaks volumes.

It's not a rush, but rather an execution with quite a bit of grace.

To spread the word.

"I'll give you two, and you're asking me to take Charlotte."

It would mean that I would show up on the spot and take the three of them away somehow.

The crowd wants Charlotte to be judged somehow, so I can't sneak her to them, and even if I did, the Empire wouldn't know where I was.

So just as you're about to judge Charlotte in public, the devil takes over.

As an empire, it's a good picture to excuse a lot of things.

I tried to do as you asked, but the devil appeared.

Eventually, Bertus can no longer protect Charlotte.

So I'll give you two of my men back, but please take Charlotte with you," was Bertus's way of saying.

"Really....... way of doing things that is so bizarre and mind-blowing......."

It communicates its will to me in this way without knowing where I am.

I was in awe.

I wonder if my unintentional appearance on the ecliptic will be the catalyst that will eventually bring Charlotte back, as well as Sarkegar and Lucinil.

Three weeks later, at noon on a Sunday.

They've never coordinated with each other, but they need to stage a staged kidnapping.



* * *



At this point, there's one thing Reinhardt doesn't know.

"Three weeks from now, it's Sunday, brother."

"......."

Charlotte nodded, sitting up in bed with a dark look on her face.

Bertus didn't fail to hold on.

Charlotte wanted it for herself.

Your existence is a burden to humanity and the empire, and if your life, even if it's a waste, can bring even the slightest relief to the people, then so be it.

If you force me to live, the empire will fall.

This was happening because Charlotte had asked for her own execution, in addition to the demands of the Emperor and the Five Great Patriarchs.

Bertus rightly refused.

No way.

That's not going to happen.

The words that came out of my brother's mouth for the first time in a very long time were kill me.

Kill me and prolong the life of the Empire. If your very existence is the cause of division, you must do something about it, even in death.

And since she actually caused all of this to happen, she realized that since she can't go out and fight like Ellen, she should do something like this.

As it is, it's already dividing empires in real time, so it might as well be dead.

Give up.

Give up.

Regret.

Beyond all of that, Charlotte was at a point where she hated herself and had no attachment to life.

Bertus didn't make this decision because he was tired of the crowds, the empire, and the demands of the Great Patriarch.

If I don't execute him, he'll kill himself in the Palace of Spring.

So this was the only way I could squeeze it out somehow.

Bertus didn't say anything to Charlotte.

That Reinhardt appeared on the ecliptic.

That Reinhardt is watching from somewhere in the ecliptic.

That they still want to protect people.

It didn't tell me anything about that.

I didn't say anything, knowing that it would only add to Charlotte's self-loathing.

So this is Bertus's dogma.

All Charlotte knows is that in three weeks, she will be burned at the stake in the public square, alone.

That's why I didn't say who might come.

Charlotte doesn't even know who's hanging with her.

I didn't say anything like that. Charlotte would never allow that to happen to her.

They'll think it's unforgivable, and if I tell them Reinhardt is coming to save them, they'll strangle themselves.

If Reinhardt doesn't show up on time three weeks later, it's okay.

Bertus will save Charlotte, even if it means killing himself.

It will no longer be able to return to the ecliptic, but it will be able to live quietly somewhere.

We don't know how to make a brother who has given up on life live again.

The only thing you can do is make sure that Charlotte is life-affirming and doesn't die.

That was it.

Only Reinhardt can keep Charlotte alive.

Thus, Bertus is speaking to an invisible Reinhardt.

Please.

Let Charlotte live another day.

I know it's unreasonable to ask, but please forgive Charlotte.

You can't forgive me, but you can forgive Charlotte.

In effect, it was the emperor begging the devil.

The Empire can't protect Charlotte, so the Devil does.

"Brother."

"......."

Charlotte doesn't think she deserves to be forgiven, so if you tell her your plan, she will reject it.

So, I had no intention of telling Charlotte this story.

Approaching the silent Charlotte, Bertus pulled up a chair and sat down.

All of this devastation, even if it wasn't caused by her failure to believe in the Devil, was enough to send Charlotte into a spiral of self-pity that she couldn't escape.

She can't bear to think of herself forgiven by Reinhardt, safe and protected by him.

Bertus stares at his brother, now in the form of a demon. Charlotte's red eyes stare back at him.

If Reinhardt takes Charlotte, she will be protected by the Devil from then on, if indeed Reinhardt shows up.

Because Bertus can't protect Charlotte.

You don't know where the devil is, and he won't tell you.

So, this will be the last time Bertus sees Charlotte for three weeks.

They hated each other to the point of wanting to kill each other, and how many times they actually tried to kill each other.

I don't know how long this has been the case.

At some point, however, as he watched Charlotte become too weak to be considered a competitor, Bertus changed his mind.

Competitors that aren't worth dealing with.

In a losing contender.

When my misconceptions about the Devil were not cleared up, I saw him as a poor brother who had been used by Reinhardt from the beginning.

And now, it's impossible to control myself.

He had brought the world to this state, and he was so buried in the words of his own curses to the devil that he could do nothing but feel guilty, blame himself, and beat himself up.

The First Emperor is dead, and Bertus has taken over.

Ever since, Bertus has wanted to protect Charlotte at all costs.

Ever since the world hated Charlotte, Bertus has been fighting to protect her.

Even as the crowd, as well as numerous ministers, poured out their suspicions about Charlotte's ties to the Devil, Bertus ignored them all.

Somehow, he hoped his pathetic brother would survive.

And now, Bertus is going to let the devil do what he can't.

Charlotte's red eyes look to Bertus, who looks to himself.

Last but not least.

Because it's the last one.

"Brother......."

"......."

"Can I hold you?"

At Bertus' words, Charlotte's eyes widened in slight surprise.

Bertus smiled bitterly, seeing in the always dead eyes a trace of something that had long since returned: emotion.

Just like Bertus did.

During this terrible time, Charlotte saw the brother she hated so much trying to protect her.

Only after everything is broken.

Only after you've ruined everything with your own hands.

It's no wonder that a brotherhood was created between them that didn't and couldn't exist.

Charlotte doesn't know what's about to happen.

Therefore, he believes that Bertus is only doing this because he is sorry that he made the decision to kill him, even if it was at his request.

Charlotte is choosing her own death.

Sorry.

Charlotte hesitates, looking at Bertus, who says it guiltily.

You will die.

Charlotte hesitated for a moment, then slowly leaned toward Bertus.

Bertus pulled the small, slender head of Charlotte to his chest and held her close.

This was all new to me.

Oh, how small it was.

Bertus thinks to himself as he embraces his brother for the first time.

"Gotta go somewhere nice....... I have to go to a good place......."

"......."

Bertus could only say that, for fear that if he were to be specific, his emaciated but brilliant brother might recognize what he was talking about.

Therefore, Charlotte began to cry a little while being held by Bertus.

A good place to start.

Is it okay to allow yourself to be in that place?

I'm dead, and if I die, I'll have to burn in the fires of hell for bringing this on the world.

Is it possible to die and go to a good place?

Charlotte cries a little in her brother's arms, thinking she must not be able to go.

"......."

If Reinhardt comes.

So, if you take Charlotte.

Life with the Devil is better than life in this springtime palace, at least.

She would be forgiven by Reinhardt, and though she would still feel self-pity and bitterness, it would be a better life than the one she had now, locked in her dark bedroom, doing nothing.

You're going to have less and less to say, and you're going to be looking for something to do.

And so, out of Bertus' sight, she would live a better life than the one she had now.

What you can't do, Reinhardt can do for you.

Now that he is Emperor, Bertus must take responsibility for what he has done.

Unable to become emperor, Charlotte will live under the protection of the devil, for she has no responsibilities.

That's where Reinhardt comes in.

It will come, Bertus believes.

I only trust Reinhardt after all the things that happened because I didn't trust him when I needed him most.

I know this is a terrible thing to do.

I know I'm being horribly hard on Reinhardt.

It's the only way to do it.

Bertus couldn't think of anything else but this choice.

"Sorry....... Sorry brother......."

In Bertus' apology.

In that first embrace, Charlotte shook her head, realizing that death, not survival, awaited her.

"No......."

Charlotte struggles to speak, her voice cracking.

"If I....... I'm more sorry......."

I could have said something like that.

"So far....... really, really....... thank you."

And not just being held, but moving his slender arms to hug his sibling face to face.

I was able to.
