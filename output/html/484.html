            Episode 484.





The night we greeted the people of Rizaira, there was a feast.

It was a feast to welcome me as Ellen's friend and guest.

The game was trimmed, roasted whole, and the villagers gathered to eat and drink.

The people of Rizaira were self-sufficient, and there seemed to be nothing wrong with that.

They welcomed me because I was a friend of Ellen's.

Adults realize that the world is in a big mess right now, but they don't talk about it.

And it seemed like most people didn't know about per diems.

Everyone is worried about Ellen, but I can tell they don't think anything bad will happen to her.

Are the people of Rizaira born here, and do they live here until they die?

Do outsiders ever trickle into town?

"You say it's all out there, but what's it really like? We're so deep in the mountains, nothing's happening, and the adults don't say anything. They just tell us not to stray too far from the village."

Lena.

The guy who introduced himself as Ellen's childhood friend asked.

Sitting on the other side of the table, I could see that Arta was also focused on me.

They don't know the full story.

Lizaira didn't seem to realize that it was very strange that nothing was happening right now.

"Dangerous, a lot."

"Chet, you're not going to tell me the truth either, are you?"

There was no reason to tell them that it was hell outside if they didn't know the details.

I stare at the adults in the village laughing and talking, and at Ellen's parents.

You don't have to die for someone. Just because you have the power and ability doesn't mean you have to do it.

However, it was never comfortable for me to see them living like this, hidden from the world.

We don't know what specific powers they have.

However, with their combined power, things could be resolved more quickly.

I couldn't get rid of those regrets and questions.

-.......

As if she could read my thoughts, Ellen's mother, Luna Artorius, who was sitting in the far seat, looked at me for a moment.

She quickly looked away, but I could feel that she had just seen exactly what I had.



* * *



"Follow me, Reinhard."

After the feast, she cleaned up and took me aside.

She led the way wordlessly, crossing the foothills of Rizaira.

Soon, we came to a vacant lot with a small warehouse.

Luna didn't bother to explain what this place was.

It's self-explanatory.

It was where Ragan and Ellen had practiced their swordsmanship.

We don't know how the two warriors practiced swordsmanship at this location. Perhaps Ragan taught Ellen to sword. I do not know if Ragan learned the sword from Luna or Ronan.

However, I knew that I was in one of those historical places.

Is it trying to teach me something.

What can I learn from Luna?

"You cannot have the power I use."

Not can't teach, but can't have.

I felt my breath catch in my throat at that conclusive statement.

"Maybe I can't even teach you something properly."

I don't know what her limitations are or what her situation is. But it's clear that trying to teach me something is a big adventure for her.

Just like I can't turn away from the world.

Maybe that's the story, that she just couldn't turn away from me.

"But promise me one thing."

"What....... ?"

"Trust me."

"......."

"Can you do that?"

Trust me.

I don't know what that means.

Why do you say this before you teach me something?

Perhaps, she's saying, there will continue to be situations where you won't be able to trust her.

Why is she talking as if she has a premonition that something is going to happen that she can't trust?

However, she took me in on a whim.

It even tries to teach you something.

"Of course you do."

"......."

She stares at me.

You have to trust her.

If only so that you can take something with you and be prepared for what happens later.

You have to believe it.

There's nothing to be gained by coming all this way and doubting Luna.

What does she think of the word believe.

She didn't express any patriarchal opinions.

Just, you know, nod.

"Try disenchantment."

"Yes."

-curl!

Enchanting itself is now as easy as breathing.

Explosive bursts of magic coursing through your body, and strengthening.

Could she lead me to the next step.

It's been about 3 seconds since I used the Enchantment.

"That's enough."

At her instruction, I stopped the magical emission of the enchantment.

I wonder if she can find my problem just by looking at me. Luna turned away.

"Your mana flow is too emotional."

And that's all he says.

"Let's go back."

Trust me.

I thought I knew what he meant.



* * *



How much time is left.

I think we have quite a bit of time before the final fight.

However, the situation was different from the original, so anything could happen at any time.

In Edina, Antirrhinus was able to get some idea of what was happening on the continent and in the empire through the information he was able to gather.

But Rizara is so isolated from the rest of the world that the happenings of the world don't reach my ears.

I arrived in Rizaira hoping to make a breakthrough, but I didn't learn anything.

The only thing I heard was that my mana flow was too emotional.

And a few days after that.

Luna cooked me a meal, and Ronan and I went about the business of the village.

I could tell at a glance that life was busy, and I had to be self-sufficient.

I couldn't help but get antsy as I looked at the scene.

I don't have time for this.

I have no time to waste.

People are dying right now, we don't know what's going on in Edina, we don't know what's going on in the Empire, and we don't know what's going on in the continent.

You've been swinging your sword around and around, barely able to breathe.

I can't imagine having to sit back and watch people in mountain villages live their lives.

She said she wasn't even worried about Ellen.

I felt like screaming that dozens of times a day.

But.

She hasn't even asked me to do it again since she saw my enchantment that night.

Isolated from the rest of the world, Lizara was so far removed from it that she couldn't even hear what was going on in the world.

I felt like I was going to go crazy with frustration, and while Luna and Ronan took good care of me, they didn't really do anything I wanted.

It was so crazy, I swung my sword all day in a vacant lot.

Maybe she wants me to make a breakthrough on my own.

He drew and drew and drew until he was exhausted, and when he was close to exhaustion, he leaned back against a tree in a daze.

Once he recovered, he focused his attention on finding the next step in his enchantment.

Nothing came of it.



* * *



A week after arriving in Rizaira.

Although I had gained some familiarity with the people of Rizaira, Luna and Ronan still hadn't taught me anything.

Eventually, I had to make a decision.

Breakfast time.

"Wait....... Do you mind if I go back and come back?"

"Going back, where do you mean?"

I sighed at Luna's words.

"I've got things and people I need to take care of, and I'll have to come back and see how things go."

I say, and she stares at me.

"You may go back. But if you do, I will not let you back into Rizaira."

"......."

Because.

It's not that big of a deal to leave and come back, right?

The words rose to the top of my throat, but I couldn't bring myself to spit them out.

Luna told me to trust myself.

However, a week.

I felt like I was going to lose my mind when she didn't care.

I'd rather do something, but I don't know if you're giving me an assignment I can't handle.

It was just sitting there, doing nothing.

No amount of grunting on my own could give me a clue, and you don't have to be Lizaira to do that.

I felt like I was going to go crazy without Edina, without me, without knowing how things were happening and rolling that I didn't know about.

I had planned to be gone for a long time, but once I was gone, I realized that Edina didn't need me, I needed the world's information.

I didn't know how the world was going to work, and I felt like I was going to go crazy with anxiety.

So wait.

I could teleport there in a few hours, not a day.

If I leave, I'll never come back here again.

I couldn't figure out what the hell Luna was thinking.

"What would you do?"

Luna stares at me, as if it's your choice.

Time is passing.

Something irreversible is happening.

Am I really, really going to get anything out of Lizaira?

"...... will remain."

Luna merely nodded, as if to say that would be the way to go.



* * *



You've been in Rizaira for three days.

It's been well over a month since I've been away from Edina.

As the end of the gate crisis nears, the rate at which gates are being destroyed slows down, and you need to approach each one carefully as you prepare for the big fight.

I was having these thoughts hundreds of times a day, paroxysmally.

Isolation. And anxiety.

I was going crazy with things I didn't know happening in places I wasn't.

Charlotte is doing a good job of taking over Edina's job.

Maybe Riana and Olivia have gotten into trouble.

That would be awkward for Herriot, who's stuck in the middle.

Is Ellen okay, or is she being sent on a mission that's too risky?

Not knowing what was going on in the world, I was stressed to the point of nausea.

On the plus side, yesterday, Luna gave me another enchantment.

She didn't say anything this time. As soon as she saw me use my powers, she said enough and turned and walked away.

If it sucks, it sucks.

If it's rough, it's rough.

If it's not good enough, it's not good enough.

If you have a problem, at least tell me what it is.

I wanted to scream, but I couldn't find the words.

Something is missing.

Wondering if I'd have to figure it out on my own, I tossed around a bunch of enchantments in an empty lot.

"Huh....... 헉......."

Even great horsepower has its limits.

After draining all my energy, I slumped back against the tree trunk, sweating profusely.

Through the process of draining and rebuilding my hp, my hp was rising.

But I have to move on to the next step.

This is no longer relevant.

Talent.

The talent is there.

No one is better equipped than Ellen to teach a master class than me.

I don't know what's wrong or what's missing.

I think we're just one step away.

I can't figure out how to take that one step.

"Would you like some water?"

"......?"

A voice came out of nowhere and I turned around to see a girl with short hair holding out a water bottle to me.

"Uh....... Thanks."

I had no reason to refuse, so I opened the canteen Lena handed me and took a gulp of water.

The water was so cold that it seemed to chill my brain. Maybe it wasn't just that the water was cold, but that my head was overheating.

I've been here for a couple of months now and have gotten to know the villagers a bit.

However, since I spent most of the day in this empty lot, I rarely ran into people.

Even with Ellen's childhood friend, Lena, this was only the third time they had spoken.

Lena looks at me and shakes her head.

"You're always here, aren't you?"

"......."

"Actually, I've been watching you from afar for a while now, and you're pretty damn good."

"...... is it?"

I was able to dominate the master class with power alone, at a level that only horsepower enhancements can. It doesn't change the fact that my physique is off spec.

It's just that it's not my favorite.

I stare at Lena.

Rizaira is no ordinary village.

So, does Lena know how to use a sword and other weapons?

"Weapons, do you know how to use them?"

"Me?"

Lena pointed a finger at herself and shook her head.

"No, not really, I've learned from Lagan before with Ellen and Arta, but I'm not good at it."

A town where the names of two heroes of humanity are casually mentioned.

That's right, Lizara is a really weird town.

"Come to think of it, I think you're better with a sword than either Ragan or Ellen."

"No way......."

"Is that because it's been a long time since you've seen Ragan or Ellen use a sword? Is Ellen a big deal now, too?"

Lena didn't really seem to have a knack for handling weapons.

My preconceived notions of Rizaira were based on the fact that, with a few exceptions, the people there are pretty normal.

In any case, Lena was wrong.

I don't know what Lagan Artorius's accomplishments against the Demon were, but Ellen is stronger than I am simply in terms of sword, and when she gives it everything she's got, I'm no match.

Lena takes the canteen from me and gulps down the water with a grunt. After drinking the water, Lena looks at me and crosses her arms.

"I'm not sure why you're here."

"......."

"Something about you makes me feel very uneasy."

"......Anxious?"

When I heard that, I felt like there was something in the air.

"I don't know what's going on outside, and I don't know why you, Ellen's friend, are here without her....... You're making me nervous. I don't even know what you're doing, Angie, or why you're here."

Anxiety.

Nervousness.

I mean, I could see it.

"What's the rush?"

It's entirely possible for Lena, who has no idea what's going on, to say something like this.

I know there's something going on with me, but I don't know what, and I don't know what's going on out there.

What's the rush?

I'm in no position to relax.

But I didn't feel like explaining that to Lena.

"If you rush, you don't do what you can do."

"......?"

Lena looks at me with that offhanded comment.

"I'm coming, don't push yourself too hard."

With that, Lena stood up and stormed out of the room, as if it were just a comment.

I stare at the back of Lena's head as she disappears.

What to say.

It seems that Lena wasn't the only one who was weird in Rizaira.

"......."

I sit still, in a clearing, and think.

Enchantment.

A master class that goes beyond that.

And the anxiety and nervousness that has taken over my entire body.

I remain still, drawing on the magic in my body to activate my entire being.

I could see the torrent of mana rushing through my body.

Rough.

"......."

Luna said something along those lines.

"Your mana flow is too emotional.

Maybe my disenchantment is fundamentally wrong.
