"Not much on the inside, huh?"

"I think so."

In the words of Dwight, the Archduke of Saint-Thuan said, in a wide-open cavity.

There was no need for a bonfire. Everyone here is a mage who can summon a light source on their own.

The dungeon exploration had gotten so long that everyone was spending the day bouncing from bun to bun looking for a place to rest.

"Maybe it was an empty cart, because I don't see any spellbooks making a stir."

"It's not so much that it's invisible as it is that it's intentionally put away."

"That's what I think, too."

Dwin was a man of many words.

The Archduke tended to say only what was necessary.

And the woman was speechless.

Luna was a slow learner. She was a beat behind when Dwyn or the Archduke called her, and she rarely spoke, only nodding or shaking her head slowly in response to most questions.

There were no traps. There were no labyrinths like the one outside.

It's just that I can't let my guard down, so I'm taking my time exploring.

Leading the way was the Archduke, but also Lothar Dwin.

The Archduke couldn't help but notice that Lothar Dwyn was no ordinary wizard. He was a man of many words, but cautious in his actions, and while he led the way, he always seemed to be watching his back.

But a woman who introduced herself as Luna.

She was following the group a bit off to the side, neither leading nor lagging.

She didn't do anything.

I just kept up with the group at a slightly slower pace.

"There's something about you, Luna, that doesn't seem normal."

"I agree."

Archduke St. Thuan nodded in agreement with Dwin's words.

There are no ordinary people in this room, but the one who seems most extraordinary is Luna, who hasn't shown us anything yet.

Even the Archduke's mages watched Luna with a strange reverence as she wore a simple cloak and plain clothes, neither fancy nor luxurious.

You don't know their skills, you don't know their intentions, and you don't know if they're an enemy or an ally.

Everyone was watching, unaware of her slow walk, which somehow felt graceful.

It wasn't mesmerization, but awe mixed with fear.

The interior was overwhelmingly sparse, but in a space where you never know what might be at the bottom of the pit, Luna sometimes looked like she'd just been out for a walk, sweeping the walls.

In fact, she spent the day walking the halls without falling asleep. Stopping now and then, looking off into the distance.

As if in deep thought.

"Let's get going, it's not like we're going to stay long, even if it's nothing special."

"Do you think so?"

At the Archduke's signal, the mages were ready to depart, and Luna watched them prepare to go, then joined them, her pace still slow.

It was weird.

It's a slow pace, but she's never been left behind.

"I don't think you're anything out of the ordinary, Luna."

At Dwyn's smiling words, Luna stays still, looking toward the direction of travel.

"If you look at things unconventionally, what is there in the world that is not conventional?"

"No matter how much you try to look at the extraordinary, there is nothing extraordinary about it, is there?"

At Dwyn's sarcastic question, Luna stares at Dwyn for a moment.

"Not even human. No, less than a being that has ceased to be human."

It was a blank stare, without hostility or favor.

"......Haha, is that right?"

Dwin grinned from ear to ear.

"This guy is not human.

The Archduke caught his breath as he saw Lothair Dwyn's chilling smile.

The old adage of staying away from the personal resurfaced.

It wasn't meant to be, but it doesn't change the fact that you came close.

'As expected, close quarters bring close quarters.

The Archduke walked on, reminding himself that his ancestors had never been wrong.

The Archduke visited the tomb.

Hoping that the other person's grave won't be yours.

"Let's go."

"Yes, Archduke."

"......."

The Archduke led the way.



* * *



Rich's grave was deep and massive.

But what both Lothar Dwyn and the Archduke realized was that while it was a very large space, it was mostly empty. There were no traps or monsters.

"It's not like there was nothing there to begin with."

"I see."

It didn't take a great deal of observation to spot it. There were tons of rooms and facilities in the dungeon, most of which were empty. But the scratches on the walls, the lack of dust, the signs that something had actually been in these spaces, and it had been removed.

"It's like they took it all out and put it away somewhere....... I get that feeling, why would they do that?"

"I don't know about that. But I don't think they were robbed."

It didn't feel like looting, it felt like the entire space had been swept clean.

"We also found many signs of traps, but they were all dismantled."

The Archduke's mages have also been exploring their surroundings, reporting back to the Archduke with their findings.

Lich's Tomb is a magical research facility. Traps are set up to kill or chase away insects that trespass into such research facilities.

However, there is no equipment and all the traps have been dismantled.

"Maybe they've cleared out all the bullshit so that those who have made it through the labyrinth can come straight to it without being distracted by anything else."

"......Is there a reason to do that?"

"I don't own this place, so I have no way of knowing."

The idea that we've cleaned up the clutter so that we can go straight to the heart of the matter is nonsense.

But it was also hard to disagree with him.

The group advanced slowly. This way, they could reassure the entrants, and then they could attack by other means. Given the level of the labyrinth outside, this was no easy task.

The sheer size of the place and the need to be cautious in our movements meant that we had to spend a lot of time exploring.

As he woke up and explored again, he realized that it was nearing night.

After a while of exploring the rooms, corridors, and cavities of the basement, the group soon found themselves stuck in a space.

"......That's weird."

and Dwin paused.

"It's foreign."

"I don't know if I should use this phrase, but it looks like it's a new construction or a renovation or something......."

Whereas everything up to this point has felt old and time-worn in its own way, down here it's a clean, new addition.

A staircase to nowhere.

"I'll have to be careful."

Down, down, down we went, everyone paying attention, convinced that we were entering the heart of the dungeon.

How far down.

"I think this is the deep end."

The depths of the dungeon were shabby.

But it was magnificent.

The light from the sources summoned by the wizards was not enough to illuminate the entire hollow.

-Bam!

The Archduke snapped his fingers, and a huge incandescent light erupted from the ceiling of the chamber, illuminating the entire pupil.

No patterns, no decorations, no nothing, just a huge space.

A shabby, desolate place that doesn't seem dangerous enough to lure people in with a rare grimoire, but simply overwhelms them with the sheer size of the place.

Among them.

There were three wooden chairs.

The three beings were seated on three small stools, not fancy wooden chairs akin to a throne, but shabby little chairs made of wood chips and planks pieced together.

One person wearing a black robe.

A skeleton wearing gray robes.

An elderly man in a black suit and bowler hat, walking with a cane.

They stared at the first group to enter the cavity.

"They own this place."

The Archduke said.

"......."

Luna said nothing, just stood there and watched.

And.

-puddle

"Antirrhinus......."

Dwyn's eyes widened, and he cursed like a man possessed.

-Hooray, a young man who recognizes me.

"It was....... It was you!"

Where had the calm, smiling young wizard gone, and the appearance of Lothar Dwyn had begun to take on a bizarre, ominous quality.

-Two-dunk!

"Because of you......!"

Dwin cries out as tendons begin to sprout in the corners of his eyes.

The old gentleman gets up and takes off his hat to bow.

-Who are you to recognize this phrase?

The old gentleman's words rattled Dwyn, who had been calm until now, and he gritted his teeth.

"For now."

-Pow!

After leaping through space, Dwyn appears in front of the old man with a wry smile on his face, just as he had been all along.

"Fuck you!"

"Ho-ho."

-Crunch!

As Dwyn stretched out his hand, a torrent of magic emanating from it struck the old gentleman.

-Currrrrr!

The torrent of magic that swept through the old gentleman slammed into the cavity behind him, creating a tremendous vibration.

But.

"It recognizes me."

The elderly gentleman, his eyes blazing with rage as he unleashes a storm of magic with a single barrier created by the extension of his index finger, speaks.

"Pilsi, you've got the right guest....... Apparently."

Antirrhinus looks at Lothar Dwin.

"Lukren, is that you?"

and Dwin grits his teeth.

"Yeah."

as Dwyn's eyes began to turn bright red.

"The boss is here in person, what happened to all those minions?"

"Don't pretend you don't know, Antirrhinus."

Dwyn's hair begins to spike in all directions as it begins to glow a reddish-orange color.

"You killed half of them and pretend you don't know it!"

"Uh huh, I didn't kill them all."

"Whoa....... Whoa....... Whoa!"

-Quadruple!

The storm raging through Lothar Dwyn's body was everywhere, cracking the earth and shattering the walls of the common room.

The Archduke and the Mages were holding the magic storm at bay with barriers.

The torrent that poured out of Dwyn's body as a

"Yeah."

Antirrhinus smiles at Lothar Dwin from a distance.

"I thought the rumors about Akrich might draw you in, but it didn't."

It retains its human form, but its grayish-white skin glows with a fiery red glow.

A pitch-black aura coursing through your body.

The Archduke watched Dwyne's form as a lothario with indescribable power.

There is no set form for something that exists only in legend.

But there's something powerful and unholy about that ominous presence.

-Oh, oh....... This, this....... Akrich?

Richie's stuttering mumblings, blown away by the magic storm.

"I didn't come to Akrich's grave, I was with him all along."

There's more to it than just a little bit of kink.

The hype around Akritsu brought out the real Akritsu.

Like a road vampire overcoming sunlight, Akrich overcomes his skeletal body.

"It was good of you to slaughter your comrades and flee in my absence. Antirrhinus. But in the immeasurable time since then, I have finally found you."

Just as there are vampires who overcome the sun, there are lich who overcome their lost bodies.

A being whose magic shapes the flesh that has already been lost.

"Now, it's time to pay the price."

Archrich reaches out to the old gentleman with a vast array of magical powers.

"Die, Antirrhinus. I will hear the story afterward."

Akrich, as impure magic should be called, slams his hand down from top to bottom.

-Kookaburra!

With that one gesture, immense pressure was exerted from top to bottom, cracking the earth.

"It's going to collapse."

After a long moment of silence, Luna spoke those words to the Archduke.

-deadduck

The Archduke watched as the ceiling of the chamber began to crack.

The Archduke stares at Luna.

Despite his feigned nonchalance to prevent confusion among his subordinates, the Archduke could not help but be appalled that the evil entity now the stuff of legend had been his companion all this time.

But Luna didn't panic, let alone act like she knew about it in the first place.

Is Akrich the problem.

The problem is not the people who take Akrich's attacks so casually.

Or is it this woman who, after seeing the spectacle, still has the same attitude as the first time.

The Archduke was unaware.

-deaddeaddead

However, the common ceiling was collapsing.
