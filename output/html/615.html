Ellen turned and walked away quietly.

She realized something and disappeared, taking Ludwig with her, who was stunned.

"That's really bad luck."

Olivia smirked at Rowen's comment.

"I'm pretty sure there's a curse on us. We're always caught doing things we really don't want to be seen, asshole."

"Haha, maybe it's just that every moment is something you really don't want to see?"

"I guess you're right about that."

In the blood-soaked conference room, Olivia watched Rowen clean up the mess.

With a prayer of cleansing, a mop, and a broom, I was sweeping, cleaning, and organizing the scattered bits of flesh.

"If you're going to work so hard to clean it up, why don't you just twist your own neck?"

"These people don't deserve to die in peace, so I gave them a hard time."

"......How do you think someone like you is going to die?"

"I'll think about that then."

"Let's sell it."

"It's got to be good."

Neither Rowen, who cleaned up the blood with a gleeful smile, nor Olivia, who watched the scene in disbelief and offered no help, could be called sane.

"What happened to Elion Bolton?"

"If you go back, you go back, and if you don't go back, you don't go back."

"Good."

We were prepared to intercept Elion Bolton as he returned to the Alliance, or not.

We cannot allow Elayon Bolton to return safely to his camp and lead his army back to the ecliptic.

"I'm not going to kill Elion Bolton, no complaints?"

"I don't know about complaining, but wouldn't that leave a bad taste in my mouth?"

"I'm sending them to a place where they can't come back."

"It's not like we can send them home, is it?"

"Well, we'll give him a nice house with water and a nice view and let him live out his days in comfort, but he can't use anyone, and he can't be used. I don't know about you, but don't you think you have every right to grow old and die in peace?"

"That's not something I'd say after almost getting killed by that guy, but yeah."

Elion Bolton will spend the rest of his life in Edina.

Rowen smiled, knowing what Olivia meant by that.

"By the way, I see you've found a new home somewhere."

"Do you want to go?"

"Sure."

"Look."

"I'll do my best."

He's a tasteless little man, a creepy little madman, but his loyalty to the Devil is real.

It's only been a few days since Olivia has seen Rowen.

But he was very gentle with Rowen.

"I get that you like Reinhardt, but why the hell do I?"

"You're one of the people who believed in the devil when no one else did."

"......a."

Rowen professes to be a follower of the Devil, but when she first sees him, she recognizes his words as lies.

I changed my mind after the gate incident and everything went according to the devil's prediction.

So, from Rowen's point of view, the three people who believed in the Devil from the beginning to the end were almost on equal footing with the Devil.

"I wonder if it was necessary to kill the popes."

Olivia sighed heavily.

"They won't be able to accept the Holy Church, and the idea that Demonism and Deism actually have the same roots, which I still have a hard time accepting, and these old popes are going to be it?"

"I suppose so."

Before learning of the demonic contact, Rowen had envisioned adding two more orders to the Five Great Houses.

Wreak havoc in the refugee camps, causing carnage and maximizing antagonism to the Empire.

They take control of the Cult of the Gods and reform it to include the Crusader Knights and the Great Cult of the Gods, as well as Demonism and Warriorism.

I didn't think it would work, and I didn't have a specific plan.

He just knew that the moment the Five Great Houses expanded, there would be a great deal of chaos.

What Rowen wanted was destruction.

But just in time, the devil showed up.

Chaos was not what the devil wanted.

Rowen wished for destruction, but the demon did not, so the task became different.

Rowen's plan is interrupted, but he can't change what has already happened.

There was carnage, and antipathy toward the Empire was at an all-time high.

It does not attempt to take the next step, which is to make the denomination itself a bomb and blow it up with brute force.

The demon tries to reform the faith.

Like Rowen, I'm not trying to confuse the warrior religion with the demon religion.

In the name of the Cult.

Correct misconceptions about gods and demigods.

Of course, that's not easy either. It does end up being a bomb.

But this time, the architect of the bomb just doesn't have the heart to detonate it.

As such, it is not something that can happen so abruptly as to make the Cult of the Lord a divinity in Edina.

Over time, we'll take slow, incremental steps.

"Even if the popes don't accept our plan, it's not like it wasn't possible to set them up as puppets. Isn't it just going to make things more difficult? Who's going to do what they've been doing? Five popes in a row is suspicious. I don't have anything against Reinhardt, but I'm not sure it's the right choice."

"Ah....... I see what you mean."

Suddenly there are five vacancies for popes.

Hence the confusion Reinhardt doesn't want.

At Olivia's question about whether that in itself would add to the chaos and cause the Order to creak, Rowen shook his head.

"It's okay, the popes didn't do the job in the first place."

"...... was just taking up space?"

"Of course, they'd give orders and we'd do the work, but we didn't actually do the work, we didn't have the power, so it's fine without the popes, it's probably better off without them."

"If you're saying I have to do what you want me to do and do what you tell me to do from below, then the popes worked and had real power. What are you talking about?"

"Did that command come from your own head?"

"Hmm?"

At Rowen's words, Olivia tilted her head in confusion.

"Is the judgment of a person who only listens to what the auxiliary bishops tell him, who judges according to their advice, who is handed an analysis, who is told what the best option is, and who parrots it like a parrot, is it really the judgment that's in his head?"

"Ah."

"If you can control the information that goes into someone's head, you can control their behavior and judgment, but they'll think they're acting on their own. It's surprisingly easier to manipulate the thoughts of stubborn old men."

"You even piloted it?"

"I don't know if it's....... popes' judgment?"

"Heh......."

"I keep hearing that the Devil's forces are too strong. He has too many supporters within the Church. At this rate, the entire sect may fall to the Devil. There might even be a coup within the sect. This is the current state of affairs. It's hard to change that, if you keep whispering things like that."

Rowen laughs.

"What could possibly be going through the minds of a bunch of old pigs desperate to save their jobs?"

"Of course, you think you've used your own judgment to decide where you stand."

"But what if the devil actually had a lot of support, but not as much as the popes had been told?"

"What if the whisperers on the sidelines have been inflating, exaggerating, and making things up where they don't exist?"

"Was that really his best judgment?"

Humans make judgments based on information.

But information is not synonymous with truth.

If the information available only shows one way, people go that way, thinking it's their decision.

We don't think about who paved the road.

We don't think about who is showing us the way.

So people walk down the street not knowing where they're going, thinking it's their own decision, their own judgment.

The popes had been brainwashed.

And now that the devil has been touched, the useless popes have been killed.

And they're not the only ones.

"Is it just the popes, what about other people?"

And others within the Order of the Lord.

The word starts to get out about the positive public opinion of the demon and its growing following, and people get behind it.

It may not even have existed in the first place.

Maybe it's not a trend, but it's becoming known as a trend, and people are jumping on the bandwagon, and it's actually becoming a trend.

If Rowen's story is true, then the fall of the Order to the Demon King began with a rumor spread by a few people.

As they say, something becomes fashionable because it's known to be fashionable.

This means that the Cult of the Lord has been destroyed by nothing more than a rumor.

"I hadn't hoped for this outcome, but as it turned out, I guess I didn't do it in vain, because it was the judgment of the popes that led me to meet the devil."

"What were you originally going to do?"

"I wanted to get the Cult of the Lord to support the Devil and fight the Empire."

"......Did you know that Reinhardt is my least favorite person?"

"Wouldn't it be weirder if they liked someone like me? If anything, I think I'd be scared of someone like that."

"......You too, I feel bad."

"Holy Father."

"Not yet, but why."

"Ludwig, you must be hurt."

Olivia narrowed her eyes at the outburst.

I remember seeing it a few times off and on, but it's only now that I've gotten around to it.

I wonder if this is the same guy who ran into Reinhardt at the Temple tournament.

"......It's so refreshing to hear that from someone like you, what can I say, what is she?"

"It's nothing."

Rather, Rowen puts it more bluntly.

Ludwig is nothing.

Rowen doesn't say anything more. But Olivia remembers the look on Ludwig's face.

That look of miserable realization.

He had the look of someone confirming a truth he had secretly known.

This guy is nothing.

But we do all of this for people who are nothing.

That is, don't hurt the innocent.

Or was he saying that you never know what can happen when you hurt people who are nothing.

It's probably the latter.

"Are you saying I should have been more careful because it was nothing?"

"I was saying that it's better to kill than to hurt."

What happens when the nobodies become the nobodies.

It was in front of Olivia's eyes now.



* * *



The news of the murder of the pontiffs of the Church of the Gods had not traveled far. It wasn't like they were out and about much in the first place, so it was just a matter of controlling the information.

Everything was done in silence and under the radar.

Crusader Leader Replacement Chart.

Olivia Ranze's dominance.

The sudden appearance of priests with powerful divine powers.

Their new teachings too.

It was all done quietly and stealthily.

The snow stopped.

The sun came out.

The weather was mild.

Really suddenly.

After what seemed like an eternity, the snow stopped, abruptly, and the warmth of the sun shone down on the land like a lie.

Warmer weather, almost like late spring, has arrived.

The frozen atmosphere of the ecliptic did not melt, but the snow that fell did.

Like it's a lie.

Everyone in the ecliptic watched as it melted as if it had just snowed.

"You know when you do this, you can't stop, right?"

"I know."

The Demon King was walking with Liana de Granz in a secluded park on the ecliptic, watching the wet snow melt into streams of water.

"You might be able to stop the slaughter right now, but you might have to kill more people with your hands later."

"......."

"You don't know what it's like to make things bigger and put them off until later."

"Right."

To quell the riots in the refugee camps, the Empire used violence.

To prevent the ominous atmosphere from turning into a larger riot, Rowen was brought in.

In exchange for Rowen's capture, he gained control of the entire Crusader and Lordship orders, as well as the refugee camps, behind the scenes.

But that's a catch-22.

Like the massacre that stopped an empire from collapsing right now.

This happens because there can be no group collapse before a gate event.

Taking down and absorbing an empire that has already lost its legitimacy and raison d'etre will be a post-Gate affair.

One day this will come to the surface, and the devil will have to repeat history.

And on a larger scale.

"You, can you do that?"

"......."

We're just plugging the holes to get us through the day, but we all know the dam is going to break at some point.

Who blocks this time, who blocks next.

I know I'm just delaying the moment the dam breaks.

"Was there anything I did because I could?"

And sword-wielding.

And being a demon.

Everything I've done so far hasn't been because I could.

I've been doing it because I had to.

After doing things because I thought I had to, all I knew was the truth: I shouldn't have done anything.

I still do what I have to do.

But when Riana hears that, she looks at the demon and bites her lip.

"After all, I can't say I can."

"......."

At that, the demon only laughed miserably.

"Poor little guy. Come here, let me give you a hug."

"Get lost."

There's a brief spring in the ecliptic.

Melting snow and ice, but ultimately not melting anything.

Well, there was a brief spring.
