The next day, I returned to the template.

He said he was on a special mission under the direction of Dr. Epinhauser, or something like that.

For some reason, neither Ellen nor Harriet were angry with me.

Technically, this was my most dangerous moment in recent memory. I couldn't tell her, and I ended up looking for danger myself, whether she was worried or not.

Sorry about that.

But it was something I had to do, which made me feel even more guilty.

Because there will be many more.

"What was the special mission?"

Ellen asked, and I clucked my tongue briefly.

"It's not so much a special mission as it is....... some. That's an excuse."

Did you get in an accident again?

Ellen's expression seemed to change, and I shook my head.

"Due to an issue with Tiamata."

"Did you get caught?"

"So to speak......."

This is both true and false.

Charlotte and Saviolin Tana knew I was the owner of Tiamata.

I was lying, after all, and I was terrified that Ellen would see through my lie.

"We agreed to keep it a secret, so there shouldn't be any problems."

"......That's great."

Ellen stares at me.

"Were you worried?"

"Yes."

The way Ellen said it, I felt a pit in my stomach.

"I hope nothing happened."

That's all Ellen had to say.

Nothing happened that night either, so Charlotte said she would spend the weekend in Huangsheng before returning to the temple.

Bertus might find it odd if Charlotte and I returned to the temple together. I don't expect much to happen over the next few days.

Charlotte's survival has been confirmed by the name Inflection Point in History. We don't know how long its shelf life will be, but for now, it's safe.

A new trait. The role of the mood was very important.

It's been a stormy couple of days. Yesterday was Friday, and today is the weekend.

Ellen grabbed my arm.

"You, you have work to do."

"......? What do you want me to do, train?"

"No."

Ellen shook her head.

"Study."

What the hell is this?

"Wait for the kids."

Ellen grabbed my arm and dragged me somewhere.

Ellen took me to the Class A dormitory, the study hall.

There sat Riana, Herriot, and Adelia, huddled together in a circle.

"Ah, there you are, the main character. What's your special mission?"

Riana greeted me with a trembling look. Harriet looked at me, and with a look of determination on her face, she jumped to her feet, and Ellen dragged me over and sat me down.

"Well, what are these....... as soon as I get back."

Herriot set a notebook down in front of me.

"This is a summary of the content and anticipated questions that will be on the final comprehensive exam. Me, Ellen, and Adelia created it."

No.

What?

Herriot's eyes sparkle.

Speaking of which, finals are only a few days away.

"Based on this, you're not going to finish last, you."

No.

Guys.

Why are you trying to impress people with this?

"Don't lose to Ludwig again. Do you understand?"

I don't really need this.

Ellen, Harriet, and Adelia's faces were so serious that I couldn't bring myself to tell them that I didn't care about their test scores.

The competition is Ludwig.

I wonder, how far have we fallen.......

Sunday.

Winter Palace.

Bertus sat still in his office chair as he received the report. Instead of his usual smirk, he wore a rigid expression.

Bertus read the report without expression.

The idea is simple.

The protection of Charlotte de Gradias and the Palace of Spring by the Emperor's secret order has been lifted.

"......I thought you said you couldn't control that ability?"

"Yes, Your Majesty, it was thought that....... 1I was expecting action to be taken against the Empress soon, but......."

As for Charlotte's abilities, Bertus had just realized something.

Superpower to manipulate shadows.

That's a pretty bizarre set of abilities for someone trapped in a demon castle.

Depending on how you package it, Charlotte's power can be a dark one, and I realized that if you frame it in terms of being cursed by the devil, you can easily overpower it.

But I didn't have to.

There are some things that can't be covered, even if you try.

Protective measures for the Palace of Spring.

News that the staff has been reduced to a minimum and that Saviolin Tana has taken up residence in the Palace of Spring.

A maid was murdered in the night at the Palace of Spring.

After a bit of reasoning, Bertus realized that Charlotte's end was near.

So I left it alone.

But the fact that the protection was lifted and Charlotte is safe means that somehow this case has been resolved.

The competitor you thought was going down will rise again.

'Backed off.

I should have bitten when I saw the opportunity.

If Charlotte's powers were sealed, and she had succeeded in that sort of thing anyway, then the story of the Empress being cursed would not work.

Furthermore, it would dishonor the imperial family. The Emperor's wrath will be directed at you.

It's a structure where there can be no good faith competition, but the Emperor wanted it, and he ordered it.

You have a way to attack, but you don't know if it's valid or not.

It's more likely to be an affront to the emperor.

'What the hell happened.......'

Leaving Charlotte alone was a final act of mercy.

I wasn't too keen on touching the dying empress, and I didn't want to buy a bunch of empty axes.

If the situation is resolved, it's time to start fighting again.

How to unravel the situation.

"What is the boundary of the Palace of Spring?"

"It appears to be strengthening again."

"Hmmm....... It's going to be hard to get information now."

It was clear that the defenses would be raised again, making it even more challenging than before.

"Saviolin Tanara would have seen what happened......."

"I'm not going to open my mouth."

"Yeah, I guess so."

She is the head of the Charnapelle, which only takes orders from the Emperor. Her presence at the Palace of Spring is also highly unusual, as she has been trying to remain perfectly neutral in the matter of the succession.

If Charlotte had recovered, she would have returned to neutral.

"Find out something. Find out what happened. Is the First Empress really better?"

"Yes, Your Highness."

When the servant retreated, Bertus crossed his arms.

The fall of the arch-enemy.

I guess I should feel bad now that it's been reversed.

Bertus found it odd that he didn't feel too bad. Shouldn't he be punching the ground, throwing things and screaming?

But Bertus was smiling.

"Dude, what are you always doing, being an asshole?

"Who cares.

'If you're not ugly enough, you're even uglier. Smile a little. Who slaps you for smiling?'

"How dare anyone slap me?

'You're being weird again. You always seem to be able to twist my words around.

'You always say the wrong thing, always. You're always arguing.'

'You're supposed to smile anyway? I hate it when I don't, but I hate it even more when I see your face.'

'Oh, you're so annoying. Will you go away if I smile?'

'I don't know if it'll turn me off, but maybe it'll make me feel less of an asshole.'

Bertus, who hadn't smiled much since his mother's death, managed a weak smile then.

'Okay, that's better. Still an asshole, though.'

"What do you want me to do?

When I was very young, I had a conversation like that. I don't even remember how old I was.

It was time to stop hating the other brother.

I didn't really know what their relationship was like yet.

However, he's always been a bitch.

Charlotte was that to Bertus, and he was that to her.

The two are incompatible cider.

If one exists, the other must not exist.

You have to fight a battle you thought was over.

That's what makes it fun.

Bertus thought so, smiling quietly in his office.

[Enchantment D]

Comprehensive Ability Assessment - Intermediate Demon

Combat Level Assessment - A



It's been a while since I've looked at the status and it's been pretty high.

Under the influence of the Warrior's Bloodline, I noticed that my status gains were much faster.

The combat level is now Rank A.

It seems like just yesterday I was an F, but I've come a long way.

In addition to being able to enhance her magic, she has reached Rank A in Self-Suggestion, and has also awakened the power of the spirits, albeit at the lowest level.

The funny thing is that self-suggestion didn't evolve into psychic, it just became one more superpower.

An A-ranked combat level would mean that I'm now no match for any of the other big guys.

Before I knew it, Demon Domination had gone from rank C to rank B.

F-Rank's Words.

I only reported it to Mr. Effinghauser, and I don't know if he got the full story or not, but I decided to keep it a secret.

A physical scan will reveal your abilities, but Dr. Effinghauser will keep it a secret.

Once again, when I told him that I had awakened a superpower that seemed very powerful, even for a pretend spirit, he just said, "Yeah.

I don't yet know the extent to which this can be used. I haven't had time to experiment with it at my leisure.

I was forced to study for finals because my kids were in the middle of it.

The kids don't know what happened, and I've kept it a secret.

A new power, Necromancy.

And new information on how to use Tiamata.

That it reacts to my anger.

I'm glad I saved Charlotte, but in the end, I needed to do it for myself.

"Reinhardt."

"Oh, Charlotte."

Charlotte returned on Monday morning.

Judging by his expression, he was fine when he was alone.

It was as if a shadow had been lifted from Charlotte's face, as if there had always been a shadow somewhere.

I wondered if I should tell Elise about this, if she might know something, but I decided not to.

If she realizes it's the demon's trail, she might try to do something about it.

If it's Sarkhegar, you'll want to revive it, if it's Eleris, you'll want to kill it.

Of course, there's a chance that she won't be swayed by my persuasion, but there's no way she can do anything that even the imperial wizards couldn't do.

I'm the only one who can control Charlotte's power. The fewer people who know, the better.

And now it's hard to leave the temple.

The pressure from Harriet and Ellen was to stay quiet and study.

I don't think Charlotte's safety is in jeopardy for now, so I'm going to keep an eye on things.

With Charlotte's situation averted, I had to think about the next problem.

Revolutionary Forces.

You have to think about what you're going to do with them.

It is thought that the imperial court was so focused on the question of whether Charlotte would live or die that neither the emperor, nor even his rival Bertus, were able to identify the revolutionary forces.

Failure to act could lead to civil war or civil unrest in the Empire, and a gate breach would be the final nail in the coffin for a faltering empire.

For better or worse, the revolutionaries must be eliminated.

But how the heck do you do this?

Sarkegar, the man in charge of infiltration and intelligence, thinks I'm trying to use them to sow chaos in the Empire and rebuild the Demon Realm.

So you can't tell Sarkegar to kill all of their leaders.

If I give the information to Charlotte or Bertus, I have no way of explaining how I figured it out.

The only way I can think of is to say that I learned about it from the Thieves' Guild.

However, the actual source of the information is not the Thieves' Guild. It's easy enough to see that the source is false by checking the Thieves' Guild.

Charlotte trusts me more than she trusts Bertus, so even if I can't explain it, I'll just tell her it's there.

Time passed, but I wasn't making an easy decision.

I didn't want to affect future succession planning.

Technically, I didn't want to raise Charlotte's hand and make Bertus an enemy, but I also didn't want to raise Bertus' hand and cause Charlotte's downfall.

There was no easy way to determine that.



* * *



Even with so many challenges, my time at the Temple and as a student is flying by.

Finals are just around the corner.

Charlotte's return wasn't the only change on Monday.

Charlotte's abilities are presumed to be beyond crisis at this point.

This is just an "estimate".

So it seems that the imperial family, or more precisely, the emperor, decided to not only reinstate Charlotte to the Temple, but also to put in place safety measures.

On Monday morning, for a brief moment before class, Royal Class assembled only first years in the dorms.

Mr. Effinghauser and Mr. Mustang introduce you to someone.

"This is Sir Saviolin Tana, who, as of today, will be serving as the Royal Class First Year Prefect."

"Good morning. I'm Saviolin Tana, responsible for your daily safety and discipline in the dormitory."

Saviolin Tana was unexpectedly placed in a royal class dormitory.
