            Episode 254.





Ellen filled Harriet in on everything that had happened so far. From Reinhardt's strange behavior, to the assassination attempt that began, to the confirmation of it today.

Herriot was horrified that Ellen had seen with her own eyes a bug controlling a man.

"I can't believe there's a real human kite......."

"Are you going away?"

Ellen scratched her head, wondering if she'd ever heard of kite poetry.

"I mean, in the guts of an insect....... Ugh. Ugh......."

Herriot's face turned white as he tried to put the explanation he'd heard from Christina into his own words.

"Anyway, there's a bug like that......."

"Is that magic too?"

"No, it's just the way it is......."

"That's interesting."

It's a bizarre logic that if there are bugs that control insects, there can't be bugs that control people with magic, but it's not entirely unconvincing, as long as they exist.

The strand was caught by alchemy, not black magic.

Of course, it's not that it can't be black magic, but if the alchemy uses a black magic form, it could be a black magic type of alchemy, so it's not completely unrelated.

The first clue, what the heck is the magic in the parasite, will tell us something.

There are no guarantees. But that's all we can do for now.

"Let's go see Mr. Mustang."

"Yes."

Ellen and Harriet decide to go see the teacher first, since they're still students and might not know what they're talking about.



* * *

Royal Class teachers don't have dedicated classes. They focus on the protection and care of their classmates. In addition, they are highly skilled and can act immediately in case of an emergency.

These are teachers who can teach a class, but are more focused on managing a royal class.

So, while the preceptors live in the dormitory, the classroom teachers live in the temple, so when there is an incident, they are called to the dormitory, even if it's a weekend.

"He's funny."

"Really?"

On the way to the faculty's living quarters, Herriot had this to say about Ms. Mustang.

Mr. Mustang is not an alchemist, but he is an advisor to the Magical Research Society. He occasionally drops by to watch the children work and offer a word or two of advice.

But the research assignments are overwhelming, and she finds herself hugging her problems and cringing for hours next to her kids.

And with a look of defeat on my face, I'm an incompetent teacher....... with a defeated look on his face.

Mr. Mustang's self-esteem has been at an all-time low lately.

After visiting the faculty housing complex inside the Temple, she went to Ms. Mustang's address and called her.

Then I told him what I wanted.

Bugs that control people, can you make something like that with alchemy?

"Guys, you can't build that, eh eh eh!"

Mr. Mustang, a nervous wreck, sagged, holding onto Herriot.

Ellen could see why Harriet had described Ms. Mustang as funny.

Mr. Mustang calmed down when I told him I didn't know the details, but I was just curious.

After ordering drinks at a nearby cafe, they sat down to eat.

"A manipulative homunculus or chimera....... Why do you want to know that?"

Mr. Mustang looked concerned.

"I just thought I heard somewhere that there was such a thing."

"Is there such a thing?"

"Well....... If there is such a thing, it's probably forbidden to use any kind of magic, and there's very little information about it. We don't even know if it's there or not."

Being a teacher was no different.

"Even though....... It's a bug that can control people....... I don't think anyone's ever tried to build something like that."

Still, Mr. Mustang knew the madness of mages better than his students. There are those whose pursuit of knowledge has degenerated into madness, those who dabble in sobriety. There are more unknowns than knowns.

"I trust you guys aren't trying to do this, but you must never touch the old woman when she's talking to you. Understand? It makes it harder for us to protect you."

"Of course not, and Ellen here isn't even a magic major."

"Sure, but......."

Mr. Mustang was a nervous wreck, and he was very worried that the children were having strange thoughts. Ms. Mustang saw the expressions on Ellen and Harriet's faces and smiled at them.

"He's fine. I don't know what he's worried about, but if he is, the sobriety hunters won't leave him alone."

Bounty Hunter.

At that, Ellen and Harriet shook their heads.

This is because they are both new to me.

"Sobriety hunters?"

"What is that?"

"Oh, sure. No wonder you don't know. It's no good knowing, and it's no good......."

Mr. Mustang lowered his voice.

"Have you ever heard of a magic coven?"

"Yes, I know there is such a thing."

Neither Harriet nor Ellen knew the specifics, but they knew there were such groups.

"It's one of those magical societies, hunters of mages who use sobriety."

"......Mr. Mustang, please do not pass on unclear information to your students."

Ellen and Harriet turned around at the sudden sound of a familiar voice behind them.

"Eh, Dr. Effinghauser?!"

As always, the cold-faced Effinghauser stared down at the three of them. He was dressed in casual clothes, not his usual suit. Ellen and Harriet were staring at him like he was some kind of strange animal.

Of course, the attire was different, but the attitude was the same.

Mr. Mustang blushed, as if he'd been caught in the act of a naughty prank.

"Well, there are sobriety hunters!"

But the look on his face is that of a child believing in a legend.

In fact, stories about sobriety hunters are the stuff of legend. Mr. Mustang just likes to tell these stories. He's the polar opposite of Mr. Effinghauser.

"It should be ......."

"Is that ......?"

"But don't go around talking about it. You're not even a known entity."

Dr. Effinghauser bought a drink and walked away.

"...... You're being unexpectedly verbose."

Herriot said the experience of meeting Effinghauser in passing and becoming acquainted was exciting.

"Ha, ha, ha....... Actually, he doesn't talk to me at all after work except for work. I think today is the first time this year......."

To say he's cordial would be an understatement; he doesn't seem to share his personal life with anyone except for professional reasons.

Still, it's almost the end of the year.

When I told her that this was the first time I'd spoken to her outside of work, she was stunned.

Shouldn't the construction be that thorough?

Herriot thought to himself.

"What's so great about being a sobriety hunter?"

Ellen's question made Ms. Mustang break out in a cold sweat.

"Well, I don't know....... Actually, I don't know much about it either....... I mean, it's not like they're known for anything bad, like the Black Order."

"I've heard of that."

Herriot nodded.

"They only do bad things with magic."

"They're sociopaths."

Unusually for Mr. Mustang, he used such harsh language. While all magical societies are secretive, and there are rumors and exaggerations about the few that are known, the Black Order has something in common.

They're all full of examples of how they've harmed the world. From assassinations, to using entire villages as their testing grounds, to a local lord's wizard actually working for the Black Order and trying to wipe out his entire estate.

Their purpose is unknown, but they do harm to the world.

However, as with any magical organization, neither the Sobriety Hunters nor the Black Order are fully fleshed out.

"Anyway, if you guys want to learn more here, you're going to have to see someone who majored in alchemy rather than me."

She pulled out a notepad and wrote down the address and name of the classroom.



[Aaron Mede].



"He teaches alchemy at the Temple. He teaches a class of advanced students, so I'm sure he knows how to do it, and if he doesn't, there's no such magic. He's a dedicated teacher, so he's probably not at Temple right now, since it's the weekend."

An alchemist recommended by Mr. Mustang. That would be enough knowledge. Normally, they would have waited for a weekday, but now Ellen and Harriet were in a hurry.

Information is urgent.

Herriot said urgently.

"Can I come to your home address and see you?"

"Mmmm....... I don't know if you'll see me, but....... Try not to be rude. He's a nice guy, but it's still not polite to show up on a weekend, you know?"

At Ms. Mustang's concerned gaze, Ellen and Harriet nodded.



* * *



"That's for sure."

"We may not know for sure, but we do know that you tampered with the liquor, even if you didn't intend to degrade it. If we find out, there's no escaping the penalty."

I nodded, listening to Sarkhegar's report. In my private room in Temple Dormitory, Sarkegar relayed his findings to me.

"Wizards can do a lot in a short amount of time, so running away shouldn't be a problem."

The mansion of Aaron Mede, the Temple's alchemy teacher, is not very large, but the grounds are.

I wouldn't call the mansion itself rustic, but it's more than a match for other mansions.

Rather, there are substantial underground facilities. Facilities for the study of many forbidden arts. I saw something that resembled an earthworm wriggling before my eyes.

Gross.

It looks a lot like a lotus, but it's chic.

The sparrow bit some kind of earthworm, and I wondered if it wasn't a sarkegar.

"You planted this on people to try to kill me with your hands......."

"It's a homunculus."

"Yes, magical creatures. Fortunately, they don't seem to be able to get through the temple entrance....... It can get through the air."

It takes one dispel to cross the temple entrance. Homunculi are magical creatures, and the best way to deal with them is with dispel, not swords.

But Sarkhegar has taken to the air. The homunculus is still alive because it's unaffected by the dispel.

Apart from trying to kill me, Aaron Mede is a man whose death would be good for the world. Perhaps it was not Aaron Mede himself who was the assassin that day, but the man possessed by the worm.

Maybe they saw that I noticed and decided to be cautious for now.

He is not a teacher in the Orbis class, which is why he is still in the Temple.

But killing me directly inside the temple is a lot of work.

So there I was, outside the temple, with someone else trying to kill me.

"What do you want to do, I can take care of it myself, degradation."

I told him to investigate, but not to take action, so he reported it. If I had said nothing, he would have killed Aaron Mede on the spot.

"I'll have to go there myself."

"I don't see why you need to, you can use my hands, or Elise's, or Loyar's."

The beast has been identified.

So there's no need to squeeze.

"No, I'd like to ask you a few questions in person."

I found the one who tried to kill me.

Killing it was a no-brainer, but I had a few questions before I did.

I jumped out of my seat.

"Come on, Sparrow."

"......."

Sarkeghar looked a little pouty, but then meekly turned into a sparrow.
