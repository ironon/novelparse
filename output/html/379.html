            Episode 379.





Just when I thought Charlotte's condition was irreversible, I learned new information that she had been improving.

So let's get back to our main purpose.

Spells to help you run your dungeon, or spellbooks to catch Cantus Magna. Both Eleris and Lucinil brought a selection of spellbooks.

"I was curious about the magic behind this underground labyrinth."

A labyrinth that cannot be entered except by a designated person.

"If you put this kind of labyrinth in the dungeon you decide to run, you might be able to get adventurers lost and send them back without killing them."

"Eleris is so consistent."

Lucinil smiled coyly at Eleris, who had picked a spell that would create a lot of survivors in order to somehow reduce the casualties.

Eleris' brow narrowed slightly at Lucinil's comment.

"Lucinil, the reason the Black Order and we run dungeons is not to gain notoriety, but to spread the fame of the dungeon itself so that Cantus Magna can approach as quickly as possible, so the more survivors who don't make it to the end of the dungeon, but return with a very valuable reward, the better, because word will spread faster and more surely?"

Lucinil's eyes widened at Eleris's comment that while the goal was to reduce the number of casualties, having more survivors also served the purpose.

"Uh, yeah, I'm sure."

"Do you want to get in trouble?"

"Oh, no......."

Lucinil straightened up from her sagging position as Elyse seemed to stiffen slightly.

Eleris was intrigued by the labyrinths that had been constructed beneath the Demon Castle.

A labyrinth that's constantly reconfiguring itself and forcing people to get lost. A labyrinth with no exit in the first place.

Eleris set a large book down on the table.

"Since this is the actual exit of the maze, I figured there would be a grimoire to create it, and there was."



[Quantum maze]]



Quantum Mechanics.......

Is there......?

Is it magic quantum or something......?

What's that?

This is where the Lucinyl mindset is best.

I thought that was just the way it was.



* * *



"When it comes to maze design, I don't think there's anything quite like it."

"I can't believe I'm thinking this......."

Elise and Lucinil flipped through the Quantum Maze's grimoire and marveled. Of course, I couldn't recognize any of the intricately drawn spells and formulas.

And the labyrinth that blocks the path to this bunker.

"It's actually a complex magical device that combines a lot of different magics: crystallization to defend against outside interference, dimensional magic for the internal structure, including sending everyone who enters in a different direction, magic crafting to constantly recreate and rebuild the structures and traps within, and a mix of summoning magic and alchemy to generate the monsters within."

"Honestly, I could survive for 10 years on this one spell."

"That's assuming you understand and build it right."

"I guess so."

It's not just the magic of designing a maze, it's the magic of the highest order of mazes.

It's a spell that was designed to have no exit in the first place, so all of our efforts to find it were for naught.

A dungeon that randomizes every time you enter. It wasn't a foreign concept to me.

"I wonder if Cantus Magna might covet this Quantum Maze itself?"

"It's not out of the realm of possibility."

The field of magic used to build these labyrinths is enormous, and it would be something that Cantus Magna would covet.

By nature, the spell is meant to kill intruders after they wander off, but depending on how you design it, it can be used to make people wander off for a while.

There is no compelling reason for the loss of life. As Elyse points out, the more survivors there are, the more rumors of the endless labyrinth will spread, and the more people will believe that there's a pre-arranged reward at the bottom of it.

"What's the likelihood of getting ripped off?"

Of course, you shouldn't be too trusting. There are no absolutes in life, so there's a good chance you'll end up in a labyrinth without an exit. Whether it's from the inside or the outside.

My question was answered by Lucinil.

"There's no way to do it physically, from the inside or the outside, and I don't think it's possible to do it magically without figuring out certain conditions."

"Anyway, it's hard, right?"

"Yeah, and the labyrinth itself isn't going to eat people, it's just going to give them a little boost and then send them on their way, and very few of them are going to find out what it's really about, because labyrinths aren't designed to kill people, they're designed to spill them somewhere else if they don't reach their intended destination."

The magic of the Quantum Maze, which is already very powerful and mysterious in its own right, is likely to be coveted by Cantus Magna.

And tons of other spellbooks to bait.

I was nervous.

It's too big of a gamble.

If we and the Black Order lose everything to Cantus Magna, it may actually hasten the completion of Akasha, and then there's no telling what will happen.

Nervously but cluelessly, I watched as Elise and Lucinil looked through the spellbook.



* * *



Eleris will return to Castle Epiarchus, and Lucinil will join Antrianus in contacting the Black Order.

The artificially constructed dungeon and its original owner, Richie, are being semi-coerced into cooperating, and two officers, one from the Order and one from our side, Antrianus, are sent to investigate.

From now on, I'm out of the picture. If Cantus Magna comes to visit, I'm prepared for an all-out war between us.

If that actually happened, I wouldn't be much help.

Reach's tomb found in the Darklands.

And the labyrinth that will soon be built there.

Could rumors of him reach the ecliptic?

We don't know how long it will take for Cantus Magna to take the bait.

All we can do now is wait.

And another income one.

Charlotte's status is that no further action is required.

"The research is going well, but the content is too complex to analyze."

I had that conversation with Charlotte over tea in her B-class dorm room. I realize now that my research into the art of seduction is not going to help Charlotte in any way.

There are some things that Lucinil knows because he's actually done a lot of experimenting, not just reading about it.

Charlotte is fine now. She just needs to come to terms with the fact that she's one with the Devil.

In short.

There are now two devils in the world.

b.

And Charlotte, fused with the spirit of ancestral Balinese.

Charlotte may not have horns, but can she use her demonic control powers?

While he didn't have the same mastery of magic as the Demon, he did have access to the power to use shadows, an ability that the Demon embodied.

I don't have that kind of power, so it must have been a special ability that only the Ancestral Demon Valie possessed.

I like knowing that Charlotte's condition has already improved, and Charlotte seems happy that she thinks that the enchantment can stabilize her condition.

How do I get Charlotte to accept that it's okay for the power to overtake her from time to time?

"......."

Looking out over the terrace, Charlotte's complexion darkened.

I looked over and saw Riana and Cliff running down the trail.

The revolutionary forces fell into the hands of Owen de Getmora, and indeed into the hands of the imperial government.

Charlotte knows that Riana's vengeance is misdirected.

Regardless of her decision to hate the current demon, Riana is just being tricked.

Charlotte didn't explain anything to me.

"By the way, we're about to be seniors."

Charlotte said, forcing a cheerful expression.

Winter break has come to an end, and with it, a lot of things.

We're in the second grade.

Then, the first years will come in.

Honestly, I don't pay attention to freshmen. I've got too many other things on my mind to do like senior year.

"What kind of kids are they?"

However, it was nice to see Charlotte smiling as she wondered what the juniors would be like.

But somehow.

It suddenly occurred to me that the smile looked a bit, well, forced.



* * *



The end of winter break is almost here.

Each man's desire to be strong was fueled by a different fire. Some were driven by revenge, some were driven by helping others, and some were driven by a sense of protecting something.

The close combat majors had it pretty good in that regard.

-Ka-ching!

"Poof!"

"This is a power you are not yet familiar with, Ludwig. If you don't use it in moderation, it will ruin you."

"Yes!"

Saviolin Tana was a resident teacher and was available to teach us at any time.

There are now four sides that can be enchanted.

Me, Ellen, Klippmann, and Ludwig.

Originally, Ludwig was the only one who persisted in harassing her, but they each began to learn swordplay from her.

In Ellen's case, her schedule was juggled with the Miss Temple contest, so she didn't have time to teach, and then she went back to her hometown, and so on and so forth, so she met up with Saviolin Tana, but it was very late in the game when they shared the sword.

Scarlett wasn't here, as we'd only checked on those who could be enchanted.

Of course, cold water has its ups and downs, and Klippmann and Ludwig were still rough and tumble with their enchantments.

Saviolin Tana had originally treated Ludwig appropriately, calling him a sunbae.

But then, out of nowhere, he awakens a magical enhancement. And then there was Klippmann. After realizing that Ludwig and Klippmann's qualities were nothing out of the ordinary, Savior Tana's teaching became quite serious.

You never know when the next big fight is going to happen, so training people is something she feels she has to do, even if she's not a formal teacher at Temple.

"What if you focus on enchantment to the detriment of what you can actually see? Look at the invisible as well as the visible."

"You're being too hard on horsepower. No one has unlimited power. It is not the absolute amount of power that matters. Remember, true destructive power comes from precision and finesse in the use of magic. The same amount of power can crush a boulder, or just hurt your hand, depending on how you use it."

"Enchanted body armor is of a different quality than the barriers used by mages. They shape their shields to be as efficient as possible, which is why they have spells and casting. But with enchanted barriers, the barrier is a pure release of power. Even if you use the same amount of magic, the protection itself is not comparable to a magical shield. Remember. There are situations where you can get hit, and there are situations where you shouldn't, and as a result, investing too much energy into your shields will decrease your endurance."

"Swordsmanship needs to be overhauled from the ground up in the context of using magic enhancements. There are times when you have to allow things that you shouldn't have allowed before, and there are attacks that you shouldn't allow at all. Understand the weight and focus of the enemy's attack. After all, the purpose of swordplay is to take your opponent's life."

"You're inexperienced, we'll have to wait until you've gotten used to the enchantment before proceeding. Ludwig."

"Let's do some more."

"No, sore muscles aren't the problem with overusing enchantments. When I say rest, it's not a suggestion, it's a command. Rest."

"Yeah that....... Yes."

Savior Tana had been watching Ludwig and Cliff in a little more detail than just a few quick words.

Of course, I was limited in what I could teach them because they weren't used to enchantments yet.

"You're getting the hang of this very quickly, Reinhardt."

"Okay, great. Can you do some fine-tuning of the power? Like, double the shields, then cut them in half?" ....... Oh, yeah. That works. Excellent."

"Of course, your skills are still lacking, but your growth is remarkable. You are already at the level of an Adept, especially in the area of enchantment."

"In most situations, someone of your caliber should have no trouble dealing with people who don't know how to use magic enhancements, but there are times when you might get beaten by someone who doesn't know how to use magic enhancements....... Hmmm, of course, that's at the level of a beginner in magic enhancement, so that shouldn't happen to you. Sorry. I said something stupid. Forget it."

"It won't be long before you're a Swordmaster."

Sir?

I can't stand it because it's floating too much.

The attitude was different, but still extremely favoritist.

"......."

Ellen, who was watching, stood still and watched me and Tana do it.



* * *



In the first place, today's tournament is only for those who can enchant.

The venue is a Class B training ground.

Ludwig first, then Klippmann, then me.

The last one was Ellen.

After battling until we were all exhausted, the three of us sat on the wall of the training center, waiting for the final round to begin.

"Hah....... I'm still a long way off."

Ludwig wrapped a towel around his neck and drank water from his canteen to wipe away the sweat.

"......Yes."

Klippmann mumbled something along those lines.

It's clear that I'm not as good as the critically acclaimed me, who has awakened to the power of enchantment, and it's clear that I'm not as good as Ellen over there.

And the devil.

The Devil must be more of a threat than Savior Tana, the absolute in front of us now, Ludwig and Klippmann must be thinking.

"Let's do this."

Ludwig looked at Klippmann and said so nonchalantly, and Klippmann looked a little dumbfounded.

They had little contact with each other. Ludwig is also an unflappable character.

But now they have something in common: a hatred of the devil.

"Uh....... Yeah. Yeah."

Klippmann nodded at Ludwig's words.

Demons unite humanity.

The presence of enemies is an important device to foster cohesion.

I took advantage of it, he took advantage of it, and it was a complicated feeling that I can't quite put into words, watching these arrangements come together, even in such a small relationship.

I look at the confrontation between Ellen and Tana.

Watching the waves of blue mana wash over Ellen's body, Tana concentrated her power.

-pot!

-Ka-ching!

Tana deflects and parries Ellen's flurry of swords.

Stabbing deflects swords, slashing deflects slashes, and paint doesn't even react to it.

Tana hadn't moved a step from her spot and was taking the brunt of Ellen's offense.

And I know because I've crossed swords with Ellen many, many times.

Of course, Ellen doesn't just use her sword. She can use a one-handed sword stance to draw an opponent's sword, and then use her free hand to grab or kick them.

Seeing the trajectory of Tana's sword, which deflected her stab to the right, Ellen reaches out with her left hand to catch Tana's slash.

His right hand is blocked. So he took advantage of the gap where he couldn't react for a second.

But of course, just as Ellen's left hand is empty, Tana's left hand is also empty.

Tana tries to catch Ellen's outstretched left wrist with her left hand.

Ellen pounced on Tana as if she knew even that.

Fake on fake on fake.

I mean, not just jumping in, but literally flinging yourself into Tana's arms, almost like a hug.

-Bam!

"Yuck!"

"!"

"!"

"?"

He punched Tana in the forehead.

-Bam!

I wasn't expecting this, and I saw Xavier Tana, who had fallen backwards on her ass, clutching her forehead, her mouth open in disbelief.

"????"

"What is it?

"What have I gotten myself into?

"No, what are you doing?

"What is this?

"What is this?

Tana's expression was a mixture of emotions.

Ellen won the game with a flurry of punches.

You're right about the upvotes.

What to say.

I was dumbfounded because I didn't think Ellen would do that.
