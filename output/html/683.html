Last episode - Red Thread



Some things are written in blood.

Some pictures must be drawn in blood.

So it was with the Demon King's Empire.

In the aftermath of the Gate, the Demon King declared a new empire.

There were those who believed in the Devil, and there were those who did not.

Hence the divide.

The divisions scattered and germinated their own seeds.

There have been a few wars.

The seeds of division were not lost, but scattered somewhere else.

Importantly, the Demon King's empire was never defeated.

If you're asking if there was no prosperity and rebuilding, it wasn't.

While division and conflict persisted, the world was restoring civilization.

And so, sometimes hesitantly, but eventually, the tide of history moves forward.

5 years of New Empire power.

-Sarak

A forest in a sea of blood.

Ellen looked around at the scattered bodies.

I stare at the sculpture, which is obviously neither human nor beast.

As if you were pondering something.

As if those were the original forms.

Ellen takes out her notebook and writes something down.

I've written, and I've drawn, albeit briefly.

It's something she's never done in her life, but she's gotten used to it.

But why draw a picture?

The monsters were sometimes symmetrical, but ultimately they were all different. Many had an appearance that could only be described as grotesque, horrific, and unfamiliar.

Drawing and documenting those individual monsters is something that didn't really make sense during the Gate crisis.

Nevertheless, Ellen does it.

After a long, bloody walk through the woods, Ellen closes the notebook, puts it in her backpack, and walks away.

The sun is going down.

Ellen knows that night in the woods and mountains can come too quickly.



* * *



-Tadak, tadak

Night has fallen, and Ellen is sitting in front of a campfire.

Just as fire chases beasts, it sometimes chases monsters.

But that doesn't really mean much either.

Just as there are monsters that fear fire, there are also monsters that are mesmerized by it.

It may be dangerous because it's a light at night, but there are monsters whose vision doesn't depend on light.

So a nighttime bonfire in an uninhabited area may or may not be dangerous.

This may or may not be meaningful.

So the bottom line is simple.

A bonfire has the obvious benefit of chasing away the cold, so you might as well get one going.

That was one of the many realizations Ellen had during her long wanderings.

In the end, it was all I could do to keep my nerves in check and fall asleep.

A life of killing monsters in no-man's land.

Ellen can kill the monsters, but she can't eradicate them.

Gone are the days of monsters pouring out of warp gates.

But it's not like I haven't had a dangerous day in five years.

The monsters often had dangerous ways of attacking, which were sometimes fatal to Ellen.

If anything, I've gotten more lost in the post-Gate era.

I wouldn't say it's just the monsters.

More often than not, I've been starving, eating the wrong thing, or breaking out.

So, Ellen now realizes that she can eat something pretty toxic and not die.

Of course, that didn't stop me from doing things like roasting and eating unknown monster meat.

Ellen pulls her notebook out of her backpack.

Not surprisingly, it wasn't just one book, but several.

Ellen flips through the pages, holding her notebook up to the light of the campfire.

Some pages I'll spend a lot of time on, others I'll flip through pointlessly.

Sometimes, I'll annotate with something I remember.

Or should I say journal.

Ellen had been writing this for some time.

I had this intense feeling that this was something I had to do.

So I'd occasionally stop by where people lived. To get a notebook and a pen.

Naturally, the edges of the notebook were tattered from rough living.

After looking at the notebooks for a while, Ellen organized them and stuffed them into her backpack.

"Whoa......."

Ellen pulls a root of something out of her arms and chews it hard.

Ellen isn't sure what this is.

I just eat it because I know it won't make me sick.

And just like that, Ellen learned quite a few things she didn't even know she was supposed to eat.

I can't remember the last time I slept properly.

I don't even know the last time I had a proper meal.

Minimal food, minimal sleep, minimal water.

I was living on that alone.

If we got into a place where there was no food at all, we would be stranded for days at a time until we ran out of everything we had.

It was a fight against hunger, not monsters.

If it weren't for his freakishly strong body, the average person would have dried up and died long ago.

Why don't we go back to where the people live and take a few days off?

Despite living far away from civilization, Ellen would occasionally stop by a city or town where people lived.

Naturally, I had to hide my identity.

We're running out of food, yes.

But for now, we have a job to do.

And even if you go back, there's no way around it.

First things first.

No money.

Life in the no-man's land is all about killing monsters.

So there's nowhere for money to go.

If you've been in a human city long enough, you know there's money to be made, but it's also dangerous.

Along with the Emperor Bertus de Gradias, the Champion Ellen Artorius is the Empire's most wanted man, and it stands to reason that the Emperor, willingly or unwillingly, would consider the Champion and the Emperor to be the Empire's greatest enemies.

Against their will, the Emperor's supporters hate the fugitive Empress and Ellen Artorius.

So you can't stay in a human city for more than a brief visit and do something with it.

Anti-Imperial factions are no different.

That's where I'm sure I'll catch Ellen in a different sense.

Somewhere to make an arrest, somewhere to plead for the salvation of humanity.

Ellen's situation is that she can't go anywhere at ease.

Of course, you're not going to be found out for just stopping by. You can hide your identity and appearance as much as you want, it's just that you can't stay long.

Though she couldn't always watch, Ellen could now see glimpses of civilization coming to life.

The Adventurer's Guild that Ellen briefly experienced still exists.

But instead of exploring the doomed Darklands like before, it's more like a mercenary business where you get paid to kill monsters.

Security is unstable here and there, and we don't have enough troops to clean up the entire continent.

So you'll be tasked with killing monsters and paid by the Empire.

That was the Adventurer's Guild in its current incarnation.

If she had been paid for killing monsters, she might have drowned in money. No, we should question whether the Empire could afford to pay her that much money in the first place.

But if you're living in a no-man's land, trying to stay off the radar of the Empire, it doesn't make sense to just sign up for a new adventurer because you need money.

The face is so recognizable that it's impossible to create a fake identity.

So it's not like there's no money to be made, but it's too much of a risk.

When I was really desperate, I'd pose as an anonymous adventurer and take a bunch of evidence of monster slaying and pocket the money.

The nature of the Adventurer's Guild is that they pay you for killing monsters, so once you have an overwhelming amount of evidence of killing monsters, they have no choice but to pay you.

Of course, if you do that, the Adventurer's Guild will be like, "Who the hell is that guy?

There have been many times when I've had to grab my money and run before the commotion got out of hand, and it's actually dangerous.

After all, wandering in the wilderness is a dangerous and frustrating thing to do.

Going back to where people live is just as dangerous, if not more so, than wandering in the wilderness.

It's not like demons and empires don't care about such things, and it's not like there aren't hospitable towns for wanderers.

In some of these places, I would help out with small tasks and get a place to sleep or a little something to eat.

Regardless of what Ellen looked like, some people didn't know who Ellen Artorius was. A place cut off from the rest of the world still exists.

When Ellen finishes chewing the root, she leans back against the tree trunk and looks up at the sky.

In my temple days, I used to eat without a circle.

I can live on this amount of food, and I wonder if it was actually a waste of food to eat so much.

"......."

Ellen smiled faintly, amused at herself for thinking such a thing.

There was a guy who used to give me a pat on the back every day for eating so much.

And yet, when you want to eat something, the person who always cooks for you.

Ellen shakes her head and takes a breath.

I can't help but think about a topic I've abandoned, a topic I've become obsessed with.

What if it had just stayed.

But the current reality speaks for itself.

There are bounty hunters out to get Ellen and Bertus, and there are those who still hold her up as a hero and hope that she will one day save humanity.

Its mere existence is a flashpoint for war.

How many wars have already been fought without it, and how many more would have been fought with it?

Perhaps the empire crumbled before it was complete.

There should be only one sun.

Two suns set the world on fire just by existing.

And the truth is, the past doesn't mean anything.

It's also meaningless to say that you're wanted.

Even if you don't have all that, you still have reality.

The devil is married.

And a long time has passed.

"......."

It was never my intention to get involved.

You can't pick up the pieces of the past and go back to that time, that accumulation of time, that would have otherwise been lost.

They've probably already got a whole bunch of stories of their own.

It's just something to think about.

What if everything was good.

Just reminiscing.

Then, I should have eaten a little more.

The food Reinhardt used to make.

A moment when they could have touched each other.

That time.

A little more.

A little more.

"......."

Forcing herself to cut the thought off, Ellen closed her eyes and went still.

The wind was cold.



* * *



The next day.

Ellen stirred the fire and stood up to put on her backpack.

The chaos of the night is gone by morning.

I don't get distracted when I have work to do.

The sadness and self-pity that creeps in like a paroxysm always comes just before I fall asleep.

Do what you need to do, as you always have.

You've decided to kill monsters in a no-man's land.

It is unable to live in all places where civilization exists, so it wanders to places where there is no civilization.

It's painful, but it's the path you've chosen.

So Ellen walks through the woods.

It wasn't hard to get to the trail we found last night.

Ellen learned to do quite a few things that she didn't know how to do at all.

Drawing is one thing, but the ability to keep track of something is another.

The shape and location of the broken branch.

Footprint.

Feces.

Predation traces.

From those things, I was able to infer things like the size, radius of action, and location of monsters that weren't there.

If Ellen were an adventurer, she would probably go down in history as one of the most accomplished adventurers of all time.

She was doing this before the Adventurer's Guild changed the way it rewarded monster kills.

Sometimes Ellen was funny.

Her brother, Lagan Artorius, was a legendary adventurer.

A legendary adventurer turned warrior.

But Ellen is in a different order.

First known as a warrior, then an adventurer.

Ellen checks the tracks and tries to figure out which direction the missing herd headed.

After checking the faintly pressed bushes and footprints, Ellen checks her notebook.

Match the contents of the notebook.

And walks on the trail.

Sometimes the trail gets lost, but you can still find it if you have a general sense of direction.

There was a time when I was just killing monsters.

There are monsters everywhere on the continent, and all you have to do is kill, kill, kill.

Then one day you'll be able to hunt down the final monster.

Save people from monsters.

You'll be able to accomplish that goal.

But it's not easy, and eradicating every single lurking monster is a daunting task.

So the monsters will be fewer and harder to find.

So Ellen gradually realized how to track the monster.

Overall, it's not much different than hunting.

But it's a hunt with different prey each time.

In the case of giant monsters, it's easier to see them from a distance.

However, monsters are deadly regardless of size. So if you see a giant monster, run and kill it, and make sure to take care of the small and medium ones.

Finds and kills hidden monsters.

In the midst of those days, in recent months.

Ellen felt her breath catch in her throat.

Even though they were running out of food, they were prioritizing the search for monsters over getting food.

I found myself reaching for my notebook more often than usual.

Ellen moves carefully, but quickly.

Passing footprints and broken branches.

Footprint.

Footprints that match the drawing in the notebook.

Follow it.

Monsters usually look different.

There were even a lot of dimorphic monsters that you couldn't see as creatures.

Of course, there are some that look alike.

A winged form, or a giant monster.

There are many others like it.

However, a perfect match is very rare.

It's not that they don't exist, but they're just different colors and horns.

But a few months ago.

Ellen was confronted by monsters that looked exactly alike.

Of course, they weren't strong monsters. All of them fell to the ground, splattered with blood.

But Ellen gagged in horror on the spot.

Since then, Ellen hasn't stopped looking.

By comparing traces, wandering through neighborhoods, and rummaging.

Find something.

Hopefully there is no such thing.

Hopefully that's a delusion.

Draw, collect, and find traces.

Look and look and look.

Hopefully it's one of those things that happens from time to time.

Hopefully, there are monsters in that form as well.

How much time has passed.

When you've been lost in the woods for over five hours.

At the crevice of some hill.

-Crunch!

Ellen heard a low, raspy monster cry.

"......."

-Slurp!

After taking out the ramen, Ellen looks at the cave.

The monster stood still in the crevice of the hill, glaring at Ellen with red eyes.

Threat.

Threatening to kill you if you get too close.

But Ellen isn't backing down.

Slowly approach the creature.

-croak!

As Ellen approaches, the monster sticks its clawed front paws out of the gap.

The warnings and threats get bigger and bigger.

But Ellen's eyes widen and she moves closer.

No.

Please don't.

Hopefully.

The moment you take that one more step.

-knowwhat!

Leaping at Ellen, the behemoth opened its enormous gaping maw to reveal hundreds of teeth.

-skuck!

The charging creature was sliced from gills to tail by the Voidblade's strike, sending it crashing into the forest with the same speed it had charged.

Immediate.

It was the exact same shape as the monster we'd been chasing.

It's not even the first kill.

I've killed that type of monster time and time again.

But over and over again, I see the same monsters.

I'm not interested in dead monsters.

That's not what Ellen was after.

She was looking for that monster, but it wasn't really the monster she was chasing.

Why they made the threat.

Monsters are usually indiscriminately aggressive toward everything but monsters.

But I just hid in my cave and growled.

Like a warning to stay away.

Ellen cautiously makes her way to the cave where the creature jumped out.

It shouldn't.

It must be delusional.

That shouldn't happen.

I wandered around the neighborhood for months thinking that.

Obsessively.

There are monsters that divide and multiply.

Thinking it would be something like that.

But even before she entered the cave, Ellen was already despairing.

-King

-click!

Inside, a small cry is heard.

"ah......."

Once inside the cave, Ellen could only gape in disbelief.

Something as small as an adult's forearm, maybe six of them.

Something that looked like a shrunken version of the monster that had just died was lying there, unable to open its eyes.

"Ah, ah....... ......."

-Hair

Ellen faltered in front of the little nag.

Something we haven't found in any other object so far.

Ellen found the monster, but it wasn't her goal.

I've been looking for the monster's offspring.

The offspring are, in and of themselves, evidence of reproduction.

The most common form of proliferation that is neither replication nor division.

The existence of multiple monsters with the exact same shape suggested the possibility.

Some of the monsters are breeding.

We don't know if they were always there or if they're just adapting.

Therefore, there will be other individuals that reproduce.

Of course, there are monsters that interbreed with other species.

I hadn't seen it until now, so it remained a possibility.

If one is possible, why not two?

In addition to the individual in front of you and this species, there are probably other species that can reproduce.

I don't know when it started.

But the monster isn't shrinking, it's still growing.

Somewhere in the world.

It's not going to appear at the gate, it's going to multiply and grow.

What that means is one thing.

Monsters don't disappear from the world.

The moment you kill the final monster, it won't come.

"No......."

Ellen couldn't see anything but despair.
