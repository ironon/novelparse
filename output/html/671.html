-currrrrr

There was a lot going on on the battlefield, and in the depths of Diane, where the otherworldly dragon had appeared, things were still happening.

But only a few were able to witness the transformation firsthand.

-shootaaaaa

A torrential downpour obscured the scene, as did a huge cloud of water vapor from the explosion.

It was impossible for the Allies to concentrate there, if not for that reason alone.

The fight against the remaining monsters was raging, and the frenzied Immortals were slaughtering allies and monsters alike indiscriminately, causing great chaos.

So there was no one watching what was going on in the depths of Diane.

Suddenly, a grayish-white torrent pierced the sky, then ebbed and flowed.

But then something else happened.

A huge cloud appeared.

It was a puffy cloud, similar in color to a dark cloud scattering heavy rain.

But it was too close to the ground to be a cloud.

And in the clouds, despairing human faces were constantly appearing and disappearing, writhing as if they were alive.

Only a few people realize that it is a collection of all the souls that have ever died.

However.

-Greer

But the ominous, eerie, and guttural screams that the giant cloud spat out were whispered in the ears of everyone on the battlefield.

Some were moved to tears by the desperation in the sound.

Right under that giant cloud.

-shootaaaaaaa

There, in the pouring downpour, was a man holding a woman in his arms.

"ah......."

The man was looking up at the sky with a despairing look on his face, the rain hitting him in the face.

You've done everything you can.

I was able to get it back eventually.

But it wasn't a complete success.

The chanting, hoping to make the spirits disappear, was only half successful.

Ellen Artorius has disappeared from her body.

But it didn't disappear from the world.

It was still tangible, still weeping strangely.

It can find its next body, or it can spread its curse across the world and bring ruin to all things.

The demon embraces the girl he has finally reclaimed, and looks up at the sky with a determined expression.

If you can't make it go away, the disaster it causes will continue.

It can also be picked up by others.

Or again, inhabit the body of Ellen Artorius.

Or he could be inhabited by a demonic body.

-pot!

Suddenly, however, someone appeared at the demon's side.

"Something outrageous has happened."

That's an old wizard.

He was a vampire named Antirrhinus.

As always, he looks like he's up to something nefarious.

You have the first victory you wanted, but the girl has fainted and the demon is now powerless.

The demon crouches down, clutching his precious girl, and points a trembling finger to the sky.

Even the finger pointing was powerless.

"Are you sure you don't mind?"

"......."

"What happens next, I don't know."

"......."

The demon lifts his head with difficulty, looking at the old vampire with an expression of unbearable amusement.

Too weak to speak, the demon's eyes were growing unfocused.

"Now that you've finally succeeded in getting it all back. I don't have to swallow that thing to get the pleasure of twisting my throat in this moment of having everything."

"......."

Intense despair.

Old vampires like that.

"If you are now, and I swallowed that thing, wouldn't it try to kill you now?"

The devil suggested to the old vampire.

When I transferred the spirit to Ellen Artorius, and learned that it had been suggested by Antirrhinus.

And when he sees a future where he's going to die.

The devil didn't kill the old vampire, he made an offer.

"I'm about to make you an offer that will be hard for you to refuse.

'Hehe....... That's interesting.'

It was an offer that even the old vampire couldn't refuse.

"Well, what is it?

At the end of the last.

Wouldn't you like to be the last man standing and have the chance to destroy everything?

If it somehow escaped from Ellen's body, and you can't finally destroy it.

Before it does any other harm to the world, why don't you try it?

And so it became my last enemy.

How about being the final nail in the coffin of the story, not just hovering on the periphery.

If it wanders off without finding a host, that's a bigger problem.

If it can't be extinguished, someone has to carry it.

So that moment of kicking that thing out of Ellen's body.

Someone has to carry the load next time.

"What would you do if I swallowed that?

"I'm going to subdue you somehow and extinguish you, and if I can't, I'm going to lock you up.

'You can't make Ellen Artorius do that, so you're going to make me do it?'

"Right.

'Heh, heh, heh. You're being honest.'

"If you don't want to do it, say no.

Watching the final desperation.

Or, to create my own final despair.

Which one do you want.

The Devil made such an offer to a vampire who reveled in despair.

"By nature, this old man enjoys watching everything from behind the scenes, not doing something in front of it.

An old vampire doesn't enjoy overly decisive afterthoughts.

I like to twist stories, but I don't like to take the breath out of them.

We may interfere and make suggestions, but it's not our job to decide the end of the story.

If there is a happy ending, enjoy it.

If the story ends in despair, I enjoy that too.

I like a story that unfolds on its own, with an ending that makes sense.

I'll add a little bit to that, but I'm not going to go out on a limb and say that it should end in despair, or that it should end in happily ever after.

To end this story on a note of despair, the old vampire always had a chance, but didn't take it.

But this time, it's different.

"But you, faithful Antirrhinus, how can you refuse your lord's command?

I was asked not to sit still, but to be the final desperation.

If you find yourself on the losing end of the final fight, that's a great story too.

If you win, it will also be overwhelming despair.

An old vampire is not one to turn down an opportunity like that.

So in the end.

After an impossible struggle, the demon reclaimed the warrior.

And I haven't changed my mind.

He gestures helplessly at the giant cloud of spirits, as if to tell them to do what they're supposed to do.

You are no longer yourself when you are consumed by it.

Antirrhinus doesn't know what happens next.

You never know what's going to happen.

-Greer

Antirrhinus looks up at the giant cloud of spirits that emitted a grotesque howl.

In fact, the old vampire might have gotten here even without a favor from the Devil.

They revel in despair.

What despair that implies.

You can take it into this body and savor it to the limit.

You can truly sense the immeasurable tears of so many as if they were your own.

"How......."

"Here too......."

"Are you greedy......."

Thus, Antirrhinus seemed to go mad with joy.

You'll eat it and die.

The crazed vampire decided to eat it, even though he knew it would kill him.

There's no reason not to eat it.

I have lived too long to live for the sake of living, and indulging in perverse pleasures has become my purpose in life.

Dying for a taste of that is a small price to pay.

It's worth paying a little more.

The old vampire puts his hand on his arm.

And from there, a crimson red gem is revealed.

You could die eating that.

I want to savor it a little longer.

That's why we've been secretly preparing since we received the offer.

Get ready to gobble that thing up.

The red jewel did not belong to Antirrhinus in the first place.

A certain vampire, older than Antirrhinus, who no longer exists.

Others thought he was seeking the Sage's Stone, but the truth is different.

It's a jewelry he made to give his soul to a girl, and it contains a wish.

This is a vessel for the soul.

The bean failed.

It's a simple truth.

Souls cannot be generated.

Nothing is nothing.

Therefore, after many years of study, he completed his vision, but in the end, after reflecting on the truth he knew, he returned to the void, leaving only this jewel behind.

A vessel for the soul.

Something great, but at the same time useless.

A miracle stone that could do nothing for those who needed it.

That, too, was despair.

The old vampire never told the demon of the stone's existence.

I couldn't give it a simple ending where I could just seal it up and make it disappear from the world.

As in not actively interfering.

I don't want to be the decisive help, I don't want to be the old vampire.

But for now, we need it.

To get that right.

To be the last absolute desperation.

The devil asked for it, so I'm going to do my best to be the ultimate despair.

"Come....... Come, you lost ones......."

In the old vampire's right hand, the crimson gem floated into thin air.

"I want to feed on your despair."

-Woof!

The crimson gem glows, and dozens of primal djinn begin to appear around it.

There is a great deal of soul-searching going on.

It's something the old vampire has never done.

It doesn't matter if it doesn't hold up and breaks.

If so, you just have to take it at face value.

-Greer!

The giant cloud of spirits slowly begins to move, as if in response.

No.

I'd rather not be driven by it.

-Quietly!

Dragged is probably the best way to describe it.

The cloud of spirits is drawn into the Crimson Gem, as if it were being forced by something.

-Kaaaaaaaaaaaah!

The screaming cries were clearly showing that the spirit cloud was resisting the pull.

However, the gem that holds the soul begins to consume the cloud of souls as if it were eating them.

-Currrrrr!

The torrent of souls resists, but the soul vessel sucks them in like the core of a storm.

As it sucked, the crimson gem began to grow increasingly turbid, but it continued to suck in the clouds that blanketed the area as if it had no limits.

"Ooh....... Maximilia....... what a great thing you have made!"

The soul stone begins to consume all the souls, as if it knows no end, until the old vampire can't help but call out the name of the vampire who created it.

How long has it been.

A place where the winds that once broke the earth and tore at the air have ceased.

In between, an old man holding a red jewel stood silently.

-Woof!

However, the jewelry was turbulent.

As if it had so much soul in it that it would break at any moment.

It's a great thing, but it's no wonder it doesn't hold up.

The old vampire remains.

-Bam!

I swallowed the stone.

"Hmm."

"Hmph."

"hi....... Heehee. Hick......."

"Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"

The vampire, who was already half-crazy, goes berserk.

Tears of sorrow welled up in Antony's eyes.

With a wry smile of amusement on his face.

"Maybe....... Maybe these sad things......."

"What a world......."

The old vampire laughed for a long time.

The vampire laughs for a long, long time, as if dazed by a despair so sweet, and then his expression turns cold.

"Ah."

"Too much to eat."

"First things first......."

The overlapping echo of bizarre voices is enough to make you realize that you've already swallowed the soul stone, and Antirrhinus is fading away.

But this time, it's different.

Up until now, you've taken the place of your physical owner.

In this case, they become one.

The will of Antrianus and the will of the spirits are merged.

The old vampire will be assimilated, along with his heat.

It is Antony, and it is the sum total of desperate souls.

Antirrhinus looks at the demon, still cowering, and the girl in his arms.

There's no such thing as a final fight.

The demon was stunned.

You've already won the impossible, and you've exhausted all your energy.

So it's actually a no-brainer.

The monster, already something else, neither vampire nor spirit, stares at the stunned figure of the demon, still desperately clutching the girl he had saved.

-shootaaaaaaa

To the demon, stunned by the rain that falls like despair, the monster speaks.

"Maybe you were hoping for something like that."

"It's no fun killing you when you can't resist, so I'll come back for you later."

"Maybe I didn't paint a picture of you all ready to show up to kill me."

"But....... It's not."

"I like stories that are both epically hopeless and divinely hopeful."

"I love horribly vapid stories, too."

The monster slowly approaches the fallen demon.

There's only one question.

Kill the demon first.

Which warrior the devil loves first.

They both die here, at the hands of the monster, having reached the end of everything.

Such.

It will have a miserable and disastrous ending.

Beyond great despair, beyond great hope.

To bring closure to a story that ended in nothing.

It's the devil's choice, and you'll have to live with it.

Just as I thought that, a grayish-white resentment grew in the monster's hand.

"......hmm."

As it approached, it sensed something and backed away.

-Bang!

And something stood between the demon, the warrior, and the monster.

A massive dark greatsword struck between them, and they vanished like a mirage.

The monster turns its attention to the direction the greatsword came from.

And there was a ghost, covered in blood, with no telling how much of the monster's blood he was covered in.

Covered in blood, so much blood that not even the best preparations can wash it off.

The ghost's right arm burned with a strange darkness.

In the ghost's right hand was the dark greatsword made of darkness that had just stood between the monster and the demon.

The ghost, standing before the monster, murmurs in a shaky voice.

"What's the answer....... I still don't know."

"But......."

"The most obvious wrong answer is, I think I know......."

"Here......."

"Here, these two die......."

"As far as that goes, I think it's the most obviously wrong answer......."

"Because I don't know the answer."

"As far as definitive wrong answers go."

"As far as wrong endings go."

"I have to stop him."

"Who you are."

"What you are."

"I don't know what you want."

"Stand down."

-Currrrr!

The greatsword in the ghost's right arm suddenly points at the monster.

The ghostly human says.

"These two, they can't die here."

Seeing it, the monstrous vampire shakes his head.

"And as for you, who are you out of the blue?"

Unfortunately, the monster doesn't know who the ghost is.

He was still too small for anyone to remember.

But it's self-explanatory.

Knowing that history has a name too small to remember.

That's why he didn't put his name to it anymore.

"That stuff, I don't need to know."

I didn't even feel bad about it.
