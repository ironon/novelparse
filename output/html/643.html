            Episode 643.





June.

"It's getting hot, it seems like winter was just yesterday."

"I see."

Ludwig and Scarlett walked the promenade near the Royal Class dormitory.

It seemed like just yesterday we were in the midst of one of the worst snowstorms of the year, and now summer was here and it was time to start worrying about the heat.

Can the war end before fall?

The Allies had now reached a point where they could talk about a true end.

It's not yet the season for excessive heat, though, so the weather was perfect.

And beyond the Temple Realm, the weariness and hunger of the Ecliptic is not felt here.

I could still see the well-organized streets, neat shrubbery, and beautiful, elegant architecture down the hill.

The temple is still beautiful and sprawling.

The only thing missing is the student.

Once home to some of the continent's brightest minds, the vast grounds of the school are now deserted.

Dead, or on the battlefield.

It's not that there aren't any students, but there is a very small residual population, and even the teachers who are supposed to educate them have gone off to war.

It's still beautiful, but a space that doesn't have something to be there is just a dead space.

The temple is still under strict access control, so only a very limited number of people are allowed to see it.

Scarlett walks by Ludwig's side, still holding the black cat.

Then, Scarlett sees Ludwig's bandaged right arm.

Ludwig said that there was some kind of trial procedure, which allowed him to get his arm back. He said he moves well and has no discomfort, but he can't fight, so he does things in the rear area.

Comrades-in-arms, but in the end, everyone was busy with what was in front of them.

Scarlett could only be vaguely glad that Ludwig had said that.

By the way.

If Ludwig is in a rear-guard unit, which unit is it and what is he doing there.

Scarlett had no idea what Ludwig was doing, and she hadn't asked.

Initially, Ludwig barely showed up at the Royal Class garrison after returning to the Allies at the beginning of spring, stopping only to say hello.

I had vaguely assumed that the rear-guard duty I had been assigned to would keep me busy.

Ludwig, who was working in a rear-guard unit, was so busy that he didn't have time to see his friends.

Now that I think about it, that's weird.

Since the spring departure, the Union army has now fought only once, at Wall Run.

Our first stop, Gasonosia, was overrun by the vanguard.

If anything, the main force has nothing to do but move, and Ludwig, the rear guard, is busier.

It could be that the rear troops don't know what they're doing and actually have more to do than the main force, but Scarlett couldn't figure out why.

Ludwig regained his arm, but was declared unfit for combat.

How can a group of people like that, with a very important warp spot at their disposal, come back to the ecliptic like this?

Using a warp spot requires procedures and permissions. Just like Scarlett does.

Ludwig is unfortunately not that important anymore.

But now he's back in Temple, with the Union army advancing, and he's looking for Scarlett.

The end of the war was near, and with the fight ahead, there was little time to care about anything else.

But now I'm starting to see it.

Everything about it is weird.

Ludwig's arm.

Anna's warning.

A demon who suddenly found himself.

The ability to neutralize yourself.

Natural.

Scarlett realizes that she has become the center of something unknown.

"Ludwig, the bandage on that arm is....... When are you going to take it off?"

"I probably won't be able to solve it for a while."

"Are you sick or....... or something?"

"Not really, and it's kind of ugly."

That right arm.

I can't help but find that very strange too.

I just thought it would be a good thing if I could somehow use my arm again. But now that I've taken a closer look, I'm noticing something strange.

It's unnaturally long compared to Ludwig's left arm, and a little more than the size of his hand and the thickness of his forearm.

That's weird.

It's like it's someone else's arm.

Scarlett's skin crawls as she imagines her fears.

What are those arms?

"When the war is over, will we be able to live in the Temple again, like we used to?"

Ludwig was talking about something else entirely.

"That would be great, but......."

"Right, because even after the Gate is over, there are still monsters on the continent, and it's not over until they're all taken care of."

Ludwig smirks.

"And when Temple is up and running again, are we in second grade or fifth grade?"

"I'm not sure about that either......."

If your temple starts running like it used to again.

Scarlett wasn't the only one making assumptions. Ludwig was thinking about it, too.

"You know what?"

"Yes."

You're just getting to the point where I can't figure it out.

Scarlett waits nervously for Ludwig to speak.

"This cat."

But Ludwig didn't get to the point, he pointed to the black cat in Scarlett's arms.

"Isn't that a little weird?"

"What?"

Scarlett flinched at the words.

The cat was pretending to be as oblivious as possible, desperately feigning nonchalance.

"Over......? Do? Not?"

Scarlett bit her tongue at the suddenness of his words, but Ludwig didn't seem to mind.

"No, I don't think it's grown at all."

"ah......."

"It's been a while, shouldn't it be a little bigger?"

Scarlett's doubts were shared by Ludwig.

Black kitten.

It should be a graveyard by now, but it's still tiny.

The default value for the Small is Cute transformation party did not change.

"Well, I don't know if there's such a thing as a variety of......?"

"Hmm, I don't know about cats, but that could be it."

Fortunately, both Ludwig and Scarlett were able to move on to Morgue.

Scarlett inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.

Behind Ludwig, who is slightly ahead of her, Scarlett glares at the black cat in her arms.

"You're raising suspicions by changing like that!

The look in his eyes was enough to give away the meaning, and the cat yawned incoherently.

"Scarlet."

And Ludwig's voice suddenly fell silent.

"Yes, Ludwig."

You're finally telling them why you're here.

Instinctively, Scarlett couldn't help but feel it.

Ludwig looks back at Scarlett and says.

"Don't you want to live outside the temple?"

"Is that ......?"

Scarlett was stunned, as she hadn't expected this at all.

You're not going to leave your intact temple out there.

He seemed to take it for granted that he could provide such a place.

"The Temple isn't as safe as you think it is."

"It's not safe......?"

"Yes."

Ludwig stared at Scarlett in silence.

"I think you'd be better off somewhere safer than the Temple, so I'm offering."

"......."

With that, Scarlett stares at Ludwig for a moment.

"Ludwig."

"Yes."

"You realize that this situation is weird....... right?"

The temple is dangerous, so we'll find you another safe place to stay.

It's certainly odd that Ludwig, and no one else, would say those words so nonchalantly back in the temple.

But Scarlett didn't ask any questions, and Ludwig didn't explain anything.

Ludwig nods slowly at Scarlett's point.

"Yeah, it's going to be weird, telling you that I can come back to the ecliptic on my own accord, that I can get you a safe place to stay, and that my bandaged right arm is going to be suspicious."

"......."

No matter how you look at it, Ludwig doesn't look like anything other than someone who is plotting something right now.

"Still, can't you just trust me?"

Scarlett bit her lip at Ludwig's words.

"I believe you, Ludwig. I trust Ludwig. Of course I do. Ludwig is very important to me. Obviously....... I care about Ludwig a lot, and I would die for him."

Not because Ludwig had saved her life, but because every friend and every comrade-in-arms was important to Scarlett.

The war has changed so much, Scarlett realizes, that everyone she knows is as precious and important as life itself.

Even Erich de Lapaeri, who has been tormenting himself.

The moments of crossing the line together have built up and built up, and I would risk my life for him. And vice versa, I'm sure Erich would risk his life for Scarlett.

Because that's what comrades-in-arms are for.

It's a vote of confidence from one of those precious people, Ludwig.

I believe it.

"But, Ludwig. I don't know anything, what the hell is going on. You don't know anything. If you don't tell me anything....... I'm so frustrated and scared of what's going on."

Anna's warning.

The Devil's Question.

And Ludwig's suggestion.

Something is going on, but Scarlett doesn't know a single thing for sure.

"What the hell....... What's going on here?"

It was a question to Ludwig, but it was also a question to the demon in his arms.

What am I that you suddenly seek me?

Because what the hell am I capable of.

Scarlett asks, and Ludwig's expression turns bizarre.

"ah......."

Like you've realized something.

Ludwig gets a strange look on his face and starts to laugh.

"Ha, ha....... Ha....... Ha, ha....... Ha, ha......."

I don't know if I've run out of steam or not. Ludwig, with an unreadable expression, laughs half-heartedly.

"Ludwig......?"

Suddenly, Ludwig starts laughing, and Scarlett calls out to him, feeling goosebumps all over her body.

"Oh....... This, this....... Gee....... Ha, ha, ha....... This one....... This is it....... Oh, yeah....... Haha....... I'm no different....... Haha......."

Just like that.

After laughing hysterically for who knows how long, Ludwig suddenly realized.

"......."

Tuk.

and stopped laughing.

"I'm sorry, Scarlett."

"......."

"I'd rather not know."

You realize you've become the one saying it.

Knowing how ridiculous that was, Ludwig laughed long after he said it.



* * *



To make someone aware of something.

What you don't know.

Hating those who decided it, Ludwig was saying it to his friend after all.

It's better not to know.

But while Ludwig may laugh at himself, he has no intention of stopping what needs to be done.

Rather good.

To be a monster's friend, you have to be a monster.

He who would kill the monster must become the monster.

This is proof that you've become a monster.

If so, are we really going to be able to kill monsters?

I don't think I've ever had that kind of power, that kind of power.

You're not going to be told that you're a nobody, that you're not worth dealing with.

If nothing else.

I could fall down and die, but I wouldn't be miserable.

Scarlett stares at Ludwig in disbelief as he says that it's better not to know.

"I know you can't explain anything, but are you saying that I'm safer outside the Temple?"

"Yeah. If he knows something, he'll get more dangerous on his own."

So trust me, Ludwig said.

Scarlett has no doubts about Ludwig's intentions.

However.

"I don't know......."

"What do you mean you don't know?"

"At some point....... stopped being the Ludwig I knew."

When Ludwig returned with his new arm, he didn't just look different. I couldn't help but notice that Ludwig had become a different person.

When I got back, and even now, when I'm saying things I don't understand.

Not just the words, but the attitude, the look, and the behavior.

Even the atmosphere.

Scarlett felt like the Ludwig in front of her was a different person altogether.

"I hate to say this, but....... I'm scared of Ludwig."

"You're scared......?"

"It's ......."

Scarlett couldn't help but be horrified by the change in her friend's appearance.

"Scarlett, it's bound to be different."

"......."

"When Ashur died, when Delphine died. No, it can't be the same from the moment the Gate happened until now."

Ludwig is right.

So much had happened that it was inevitable that things would change.

I couldn't stand to be different.

Ludwig wasn't the only one who had changed, Scarlett was one of the others, just to a different degree.

The only people who haven't changed are the dead.

In fact, it's more unusual for a demon to still have some semblance of its former self, or even more unusual for a demon to still have some semblance of its former self after all that it has been through.

"Sure, I'm sure you do, but....... Telling you to just do what I say without knowing anything about it is....... is so different from the Ludwig you've been."

I didn't feel like I had changed, I felt like I was a different person.

"What if I don't want to do what Ludwig says, what happens, what do you do?"

"......."

In the past, Ludwig would have accepted Scarlett's rejection as a sign that there was nothing he could do about it.

Otherwise, I would have tried to explain and convince them of everything.

Nevertheless, Scarlett's rejection would not have been met with bitterness or resentment.

But now.

What would Scarlett do if Ludwig turned down such an offer?

It was like they were trying to force me to listen.

Ludwig looks at Scarlett with his deep, dark eyes.

"Scarlett, I can tell you one thing."

"......."

"There are people who are trying to take advantage of you. You may not realize it now, but at some point, they will."

"Are you trying to use me as....... on me?"

"Yeah."

You want to use it.

Is that what the devil is trying to do?

To take advantage of yourself?

But the Demon, in his cat form and in Scarlett's arms, can't say anything right now.

"Scarlet, there are those within the Alliance who have ties to the Devil."

"!"

Scarlett's eyes widened at that.

It's a very shocking and strange situation to have that demon in your arms right now.

Are you saying the devil's hand is already stretched within the Alliance?

"And that number is never small."

Contrary to what the Allied soldiers and people think, Ludwig knows that a significant portion of the Allies have already fallen to the Devil, and he knows that many more will continue to fall.

"The Devil already knows about your powers, and he's about to find out that you're stronger than ever... or maybe he already does."

As Ludwig says, the devil knows.

Scarlett couldn't help but realize that Ludwig had found her on his own.

Just know.

The devil was faster than Ludwig.

"The Devil is going to use my powers to....... my powers?"

"I suppose."

You don't know how your power is being used.

However, the devil can't say anything right now.

It's the Devil who comes first, but it's Ludwig who can explain.

Scarlett couldn't help but be frightened by Ludwig's solemn expression.

"Something....... Something....... Ludwig saying something like that......."

Ludwig is Ludwig.

"By all means....... the devil to....... who has to deal with....... as if you can deal with....... I hear you......."

Demon is a big, heavy name.

He may be a small cat now, but he's no ordinary creature.

Ludwig, on the other hand, is an ordinary man.

It's not Ellen, it's not the Emperor, it's not Savior Tana.

But now Ludwig was talking as if he had to take on the devil himself, as if it were possible.

Speak as if you are the one who can do it, or belong to a group that can do it.

The Ludwig Scarlett knew was not like that at all.

"I don't know if it can be done or not. The point is, someone has to do it."

You don't know if you can do it or not, but you do it because you have to.

That's not Ludwig, that's Ellen.

Scarlett swallows the words that have been bubbling up.

The Devil is not who you think he is.

It doesn't.

I just wanted peace, but I couldn't do anything about it.

You wanted to save the world, but you made it this way.

It's just a poor, pitiful thing.

I've heard that pathetic, wretched confession firsthand.

So both heroes and demons are just pitiful people in the end.

That's what I wanted to say.

So when Ludwig occasionally spoke of his hatred of the devil, and when he spoke of it to Ellen, Scarlett discouraged his behavior.

Don't bother Ellen.

I don't want to make it harder on a warrior who is already hard enough as it is.

It was all Scarlet could do to silence those who spoke of the Devil behind her back, those who spoke of him in Ellen's presence.

I wanted to hold the devil in my arms and plead his case, but I couldn't.

Scarlett can't help but notice the look on Ludwig's face.

He realizes that no amount of persuasion will work on a changed Ludwig.

The changed Ludwig is just saying.

There is no Ludwig, who was always asking for someone's opinion and listening to their story.

"Scarlett, anyone will try to use you, put you in danger, so let's go somewhere else. Where no one can find you. Safe until this is all over. We can stay that way."

Before someone tries to take advantage of them, before they become dangerous.

Hide from the world.

"Then I'd rather Ludwig go to....... using me?"

If someone is trying to take advantage of you, why not the other way around?

Ludwig might be tempted to use Scarlet instead.

It's a statement that would probably offend Ludwig greatly, but he just shakes his head.

"That's not going to happen."

"......."

"There's no way I'm putting you in danger."

He's not sure, but Ludwig has no intention of using her. Demons and others covet Scarlet's powers.

Is Ludwig just trying to stop someone before they take advantage of him?

Scarlett had no idea how her powers were being used, what Ludwig was talking about, or why the demon had found her.

Ludwig, who says nothing, but that this is best for you.

I'll explain everything to you later, so don't you ever get away from me.

Which is right.

Scarlett believes in him as someone who has seen his despair before her eyes, and as someone who knows the whole truth about him.

She trusts Ludwig, who risked his life, even his arm, to save her.

I believe in both.

But you are forced to make a choice.

Will you follow Ludwig?

Would you turn down Ludwig's offer to hear the devil's explanation?

But do you really need to make a choice right now?

"Ludwig....... Can you give me some time to think about....... about it?"

Scarlett's words stunned Ludwig into silence.

There was an indelible sense of impatience in the silence. There was a sense of urgency in Ludwig's demeanor.

But that silence doesn't change the fact that time is passing.

"I can't give you that much time."

Already in those words, Scarlett's refusal was not being considered.

Scarlett couldn't help but realize from Ludwig's words that if she refused, he would take her by force.
