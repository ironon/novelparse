"Airi-san said that the psychological counseling for these new refugees will be finished in three days, so she'll probably bring me their personal information soon."

"Uh, yeah."

I don't know when the next evacuation ship will arrive, but the succubi are picking up the pace in managing the refugees.

Early on, the power to control dreams was overused, leading to the refugees falling in love with the succubus.

When grief and despair turn into obsession with the succubus, both the succubus and the refugees suffer.

It's been said that psychiatrists don't build very deep relationships with their clients.

The succubi have never done it before. They're not good at it, but they do it because they have to, so they can't be good at it.

It's been a while, though, and the succubi don't have that problem as often anymore.

Those with more severe cases left the temporary shelter and were regularly checked on by succubi, who would visit them to see how they were doing.

It's a place that goes beyond ritualism and takes care of spirituality.

If you think about it, it's a pretty good place to be.

Of course, that only makes me feel bad because I realize that I'm just cleaning up after myself.

As Harriet and I walked down the hallway, Antony stepped out from one side of the hallway as if he had been waiting.

"Ouch!"

It came out of nowhere, so much so that Harriet, walking beside me, let out a startled squeal and covered her mouth.

This old man pops up every now and then in the most unexpected places, catching people off guard.

She knows that Antirrhinus is the second most cooperative person in the Senate after Eleris.

But, like me, Herriot didn't trust Antirrhinus at all.

For one thing, who would trust a vassal to cure their insecurity by kidnapping the king in the middle of the night?

Antirrhinus removes his bowler hat and bows deeply to me.

"Great One, what was the canon of the ecliptic that you saw with your own eyes?"

Was that what you were going to ask?

"What the heck, I couldn't see it."

They wanted to see it with my own eyes and see me despair.

As if my reaction had been quite refreshing, Antony's lips twisted into a slight grimace.

What a nasty bastard.

"Have you thought of a way to bring back the Empress?"

"I'm not sure yet, I'll have to think about it."

"Wouldn't it be easier to surreptitiously tell them to give her up, if the Empire wanted to keep her in any way?"

I nodded at Antony's words.

"Yeah, it's not like I haven't thought about that."

If you talk to Bertus, he might give it to you.

"But the Empire won't have an excuse for the missing Empress, and that will put them in trouble. Bringing Charlotte back is important, but we can't let it cause more turmoil for the Empire."

All eyes are on the mysterious empress.

It's unlikely that the crowd would believe an announcement that the empress has suddenly disappeared. There is already a certain amount of distrust in the imperial family.

Bringing Charlotte on board wasn't just about saving one person.

The wrong move could save Charlotte, but it could also spark a massive riot, and seeing how the public sentiment in the Chinese zodiac was shaken, I realized the magnitude of that riot.

Either there's a riot and the empire collapses, or there's a riot and the empire slaughters the rioters.

The former is the downfall of an empire, and the latter is the long-term downfall of an empire by mass slaughter.

So I have to approach this with more than a little caution.

I don't necessarily want the empire to be intact.

But I also don't want it to die.

Until the gate crisis is fully resolved, and the monsters on the continent are wiped out, the Empire must exist.

That's why I'm not judgmental about this problem, which is easily solvable if you have access to it.

Antirrhinus smiles coyly at my cautious answer.

"That's one thing, but as for the matter of Lord Sarkhegar and the Lord of Demand....... What are you going to do about it?"

"......."

Antirrhinus touches my inverted lance.

The two.

Charlotte is Charlotte, but I still hadn't gotten them back from the Empire.

That night.

I was in my bedroom with Harriet, organizing my day as usual.

I'd been to the Empire and talked to Antony, so I was feeling a little better.

He hadn't even considered rescuing Lucinil and Sarkegar, who were still alive.

There was so much to do.

No, actually, it's probably just an excuse.

I have declared to the Empire that killing Lucinil and Sarkegar will make us enemies. But I do not know where they are or how they are being treated.

The only thing we can say is that it's probably under tight control at the imperial palace.

Although Antirrhinus was spying on the ecliptic and the empire, he had no idea of their whereabouts.

The fact that I still don't know their whereabouts is already a clue in itself.

In future negotiations with the Empire, whenever and however they may arise, they will be a card the Empire can play.

I wonder if I can get them both in exchange for protecting Charlotte.

It was a problem we couldn't approach lightly.

"You'll both be fine."

I nodded in agreement with Harriet.

But I had my doubts.

"As you know, Sarkegar was responsible for the kidnapping of the Empress and Empress during the last Demon War. Lucinil may not know it, but....... Sarkegar may be dead."

The Empire now knows what Sarkhegar has done.

So, it might have killed Sarkeghar for doing such a thing.

And since he had such a Sarkegar as a servant, it may be that he still has hatred for me, thinking that the devil was evil after all.

Sarkegar.

More than anyone, Sarkhegar wanted to rebuild the demon world.

I had no intention of granting that wish.

Without Sarkegar, I was the king of a world that included demons, if not perfectly.

What Sarkhegar would say if he saw this.

You may be angry about how you can live among humans, or you may be thrilled to see the world rebuilt.

I wanted to show this world to Sarkegar, who had always been a loyal servant.

The fate of the world is always on high alert, but I wanted to showcase a world that I had somehow created.

Feel free to blame me, feel free to rejoice.

I want to show this to Sarkegar, but the thought that he might already be dead makes my breath catch in my throat.

I could put off thinking about my people who were confirmed dead.

But when I thought about my people, whose lives were in doubt, I felt like I was going crazy with anxiety.

I need to save them.

Should I be doing this?

Is it okay to keep putting it off because you have too much to do?

Sensing my anxiety, Harriet came to my side and put an arm around my shoulders.

"We're always doing the best we can."

"...... might not be the best."

"Well, you better believe it."

I gritted my teeth at Herriot's words.

Rusinil and Sarkegar, the problem that should have been solved but still wasn't.

New problem, Charlotte.

Can I solve these?

Like trying to save the world only to have it destroyed.

This time, can we be sure it won't fail?

I did it because I needed to do something, and I moved forward because I needed to move forward.

However, the horror of that terrible failure was still lurking inside me. I just didn't want to consciously face it.

Once again, the fear that my presence would ruin everything by itself was clearly in me.



* * *



You don't know what to do or how to do it.

But now that you've seen the empire for what it is, it's time to carefully decide which path to take.

Herriot would always fall asleep in bed at this time, reading a book.

So I'd wake up in the morning and find him asleep with a book open in a squatting position. It was as if he had fallen asleep without realizing it.

Today, however, Herriot was curled up in bed, doing nothing.

As if you're standing still and thinking about something.

He didn't seem to be trying to hide it, but there was sadness in his eyes.

I thought I knew what he was thinking, to a point.

I've been to the Empire.

Empire.

No Man's Land.

At the end, I was found out to be a demon, but I made it through safely.

So it's only natural that Herriot would be thinking about it.

The idea that if I've been there, maybe you can too.

Just as I have a lot of work to do, so does Herriot. Maybe even more than I do, she has a lot of work to do.

So it's a natural thing for Herriot to think.

About the things you've left behind.

Three enemies.

The names of three people who betrayed humanity.

Olivia Ranze.

Liana De Granz.

Herriot de Saint-Ouen.

Herriot's case is different from the other two.

Olivia has no family, and Riana's only family, the Duchess, is living quietly in Edina's villa.

Herriot can't help but think about what he left behind in the land of men, and he can't help but feel guilty.

So, about the Duchy of Saint-Thuan.

He would think about his family, including his father.

A daughter who became a traitor to humanity.

He couldn't help but feel guilty when he thought about the Grand Duchess of Saint-Antoine, whose daughter was causing him real problems.

So even though she was outwardly fine and worried about me, she could have been the one suffering the most.

He's not the one paying the price for choosing the devil, his family is.

The Duchy of St. Thuan was also heavily damaged, but as Herriot said, the duchy's capital, Arnaka, was safe under the protection of the Archduke.

And now, the Archduke was serving the Empire in place of the daughter who had betrayed humanity. The Archduke must prove it. that it was his daughter who chose the Devil, not him and his duchy.

Thus, the Archduke, in the midst of a war for the fate of mankind, was being tortured to atone for his daughter's sins.

But even that may not mean much to the survival of the Grand Duchy.

The crowd needs a scapegoat.

The Archduke is now being excused for entering the Gate Crisis by the needs of the Empire and humanity.

However, if the Gate debacle were to come to a head one day, the Duchy of St. Thuan would likely be the first victim of an angry Imperial public.

The Grand Duke of Saint-Ouen, one of the three enemies who betrayed humanity.

You're not victimized because you deserve it, you're victimized because you're looking for a scapegoat.

No matter how much credit the Duchy of Saint-Thuan deserves for ending the gate crisis, the crowd knows no such thing.

So I'm sure she's reminded every day that her family and her people are responsible for her actions, not her.

Maybe even more than me.

Herriot could have been more painful.

But Herriot never said a word to me about it.

He'll think it's harder for me than it is for him.

I've been to the Empire.

So, it was only natural that Herriot would want to see for himself how things were going in the Duchy of St. Thuan.

You know you're safe, but you don't know what's really going on in Arnaka, the capital of the Duchy of Saint Thuan.

How the Archduke and his family are doing.

He wanted to see it with his own eyes.

"Don't."

"......?"

Harriet looks at me.

"Do you want to go to Arnaka?"

"Huh?"

She flinched at my words, and asked back.

There's a lot of work to be done, but just like I eventually made it to the Imperial Capital Gradient.

There's no reason why you can't go to Arnaka for a day with Herriot.

Like when I saw the Imperial Capital and had nothing but terrible feelings about it, but went anyway.

There's no reason why Herriot can't take the same path, even if it's one that leads to regret.

Her eyes widened, as if my words had been quite a shock.

"Now that Razak is more or less on track, I'm free for a day or so, so....... If you want to go, I'm free for a day. I mean, what's a day, I'm free for a couple days."

Herriot's family, especially the Grand Duke, may try to lock her up and not let her go if they see her.

But Herriot has been working for me for a long time.

I think she should have that option, after all she's been through and hasn't said anything about it.

To see family or not to see family.

At my words, Harriet bites her lip and goes still in thought.

It's up to Herriot to decide if he wants to see his family or not.

However, there is no risk in watching Arnaka with your own eyes.

Current in your hometown.

The least you can do is to see it.

"Will you go with me to....... with me?"

Harriet looks at me with trembling eyes.

Just like Herriot has protected me all these years, just in case.

It's only natural that I would follow along to defend Herriot, just in case.

"That's a given."

At my words, Harriet eventually burst into tears, covering her face with both hands.

"Thanks....... Reinhard......."

What in the world is he thanking me for?

I was always the one to thank.
