The next day.

"......Now I know."

-.......

"You're enjoying this."

Charlotte, passing me in the hallway in Harriet's arms, looked at me in my cat form and shuddered.

-Cat!

"And it pisses me off the most when they pretend like they don't enjoy it."

No!

Not so much fun!

He asked for it in the first place!

"Why? It's cute."

Of course, my paktong was stroking my head.

Yes.

How can you not do it when you love it so much, huh?

"I don't disagree, but a spoiled brat gets spoiled even more."

That's harsh.

It's not spoiling, it's making an already bad kid worse.

But I'm definitely not the most organized person in the world.

"Anyway, borrow me for a minute. I need to talk to you."

"Huh?"

At Charlotte's words, Harriet carefully picked me up and handed me to Charlotte.

Of course, our (former) Empress was relentless.

-Bam!

She grabbed me by the nape of the neck.

-Bang!

"Hey, hey, hey, you can't do that!"

"It's not even a real cat, so what. And then again, if it is a real cat, so what, it's a human world."

Herriot urged her not to be rough with it, but Charlotte didn't mind at all.

"Come find me later."

"ugh......."

-Ang! Awww!

"Shut up."

-.......

If I freaked out any more, I'd probably do a few spins, so I hung on for dear life.

Not all cats are created equal.

Of course, it wasn't that he didn't like cats, it was more like he hated me for being an abomination in cat form.



* * *



Charlotte brought me into her office and sat me down in a chair.

Naturally, I'm back in human form. Charlotte sits across from me, her chin resting in her palm, and stares at me.

"I have a lot to thank you for, and I really like you, but you're such a weirdo, I didn't think you'd be like this."

Well, yes and no.

I never thought I'd have this kind of taste either.

But this feels good, right?

Do you know how many people get away with being cute?

Even the guys who know who I am laugh.

I mean, Galarsh didn't react badly to it, too? If you get eaten by an orc vampire, you're done talking.

Or was it because it was ridiculous?

"If you're going to like me, please like me like this."

"......."

"......I'm sorry."

Charlotte was so genuine that I suddenly had goosebumps all over my body.

Everything in moderation.

Charlotte's red eyes stare at me.

"But what, is there something you didn't tell me in yesterday's meeting?"

"It's not that I didn't say it, it's just that it wasn't the right thing to say right then and there."

"What is it?"

"I heard Olivia Ranze wants to try Elion Bolton."

"ah......."

"You're too good of a worker to just let go, you've got the skills, you're a veteran."

With a very simple handoff, Elion Bolton passed the reins of the Crusaders to Rowen. As such, when the Alliance begins its march, Rowen will take command of the Crusaders.

It's not without noise.

Naturally, the members of the Alliance's Crusader Knights know that the sudden retirement of Elayon Bolton was not arbitrary.

You can't help but notice that there's a political undercurrent.

But Elion Bolton's closest confidants are already tight-lipped.

They know that the de facto head of the Order has fallen to the Devil, but they know the repercussions of exposing it.

Not everything will be smooth sailing.

Elayon Bolton was a man who could not be left alone, and he had to deal with the noise that would inevitably engulf the Order.

So, if Rowen fails to take control of the Allied Crusaders, I can send in Elayon Bolton again. It's his failure, and it's my failure.

In any case, the former leader of the Crusader Knights, Elayon Bolton, has retired from active duty, albeit quite unexpectedly, and is spending his retirement in the Demon Realm.

It's not completely meaningless either.

His closest associates know what happened, and they know that he came under my influence after his retirement. They don't know about the Edina Archipelago.

As such, those loyal to Elion Bolton are now caught between a rock and a hard place.

There's a reason why they can't act rashly.

Olivia Lance wants to take over for the retired Elion Bolton.

"How? It's ridiculous to send them to war, isn't it?"

"Whatever. The point is, I think they're trying to get me to agree to the Cult's banner."

"Oh....... You want to be edifying?"

"Right."

There is no such thing as a demigod.

In the end, there are just different names for the gods. And the powers they manifest are inconsistent.

Olivia Ranze wanted to make the former head of the Crusader Knights a member of the Holy Order.

"Honestly, I don't know, but......."

I'm halfway to agreeing with the saying that a seat makes the man.

To be precise, position creates arrogance.

I can't imagine not being miserable if I were captured by the Empire and used for something. Especially if it's not of my own volition.

Of course, Elion Bolton doesn't get to decide, but I don't want to force a man of his stature to do something like that.

It's not like Elion Bolton is going to be able to do anything great just because he doesn't like something.

"Reinhardt, what do you think would happen if Elion Bolton were edified?"

"We're going to be priests or paladins, aren't we......?"

The Divine Order is not a demonic religion.

However, it is a new form of faith that is different from the Five Great Shintoisms and different from Demonism, agreeing that both Demonism and Shintoism have the same roots, and that is closer to the essence.

Elayon Bolton is indoctrinated into the Divine Order, not the Five Great Houses.

What does that mean?

"What if they change their minds about their magical beliefs, and then what?"

"You'll be able to use your divine powers....... Well, I guess it's up to you."

Priests of the Holy Cults sometimes use opposing divine powers. Not everyone can, of course, but it's not that rare.

Paladins of Tuan, for example, wield both healing and corrupting powers. As does Olivia Lance.

"That's what matters."

"You want to power up Elion Bolton? That would be helpful, but with his immortal, there's a good chance we're not going to go to war, and I don't know if he's going to be on our side, so I think we're better off leaving him as he is."

"......."

Charlotte opens her eyes.

"......Mian, tell me where and how I've been a jerk."

"I thought it was just you saying that you're not cut out for this job and you're not good at it, but....... I guess it's true."

Playing king.

Everyone knows I hate it.

"If Elayon Bolton is able to wield the divine power of a demon, and if he's truly moved by the Divine Order, it could cause tremendous ripples within the Order, not to mention a backlash within the Crusaders themselves. Assuming he shows it publicly."

"Oh....... were you talking about politics?"

I was so focused on the war that I didn't think about that.

This wasn't a story about the individual strength of Elion Bolton.

It's not the holy power of the demon that strengthens Elayon Bolton, but the influence of being converted.

That's what I was referring to.

"Rowen may have control of the Ecliptic faction, but he's going to have trouble controlling the Alliance's Crusader Knights. If necessary, we may have to bring him back, but it would be better if we could change his mindset a bit."

Bringing back Eleon Bolton is a hypothetical case of Lowen failing.

However, in that case, if Elayon Bolton has already been sensitized by the Cult, he will do what Rowen should have done but failed to do.

Indeed, there are many in the Allied garrisons who are puzzled by the sudden change in leadership of the Holy Templars and resent it.

Rowen is experiencing a replay of what Elion Bolton experienced in the ecliptic.

Rowen is another parachutist who came in under suspicious circumstances when the current leader was suspiciously replaced. He's got a lot on his plate, and it's only going to get bigger.

Olivia Ranze, of course, saw it coming, and was thinking of converting the playboy Elion Bolton and reinstating him as head of the troupe.

Rowen controls the Ecliptic, and Elayon Bolton controls the Alliance's Crusader Knights.

"I'd like nothing better than to have Elijah Bolton on board, and maybe even convert him......."

I can see why Olivia would think that, and I can see why Charlotte would see her suggestion as a positive.

"Hmmm....... I guess I should have done that."

I had a lot of work to do to overhaul the Five Great Divine Cults and overthrow the system while remaining undetected, but I was thinking now that if I was going to do this, I might as well do it sooner rather than later.

"No, if you rushed it, you'd only get a half-assed product."

Charlotte shakes her head.

"I'd rather do it now."

About two months.

That's a lot of time to be alone with your thoughts and feel the change in your mindset.



* * *



Can we say that Elion Bolton was a prisoner of war?

The Empire and we are at war, but it's not a war of swords.

It's almost like we're all fighting a united front against the same enemy.

When I asked him if he was going to die or retire, he said he wasn't going to fight to the death.

In other words, he's like a general who left his base and went into enemy territory without realizing it was enemy territory and was captured.

He hasn't converted, but he's in my clutches.

It's not quite a prisoner of war, but it's pretty much the same as being a prisoner of war.

He's not actually royalty or a king, but he's more of a prisoner than a king in terms of the title he actually held.

So I guess you could say that protocols need to be tailored to the people, even if Elion Bolton doesn't have any power right now.

I'm even on my way to convincing them.

That's why Charlotte, Edina's regent, and I, Edina's actual owner, have decided to go to see Elion Bolton.

"By the way, I wonder if this is it."

"Is ...... correct?"

"Even though we're spherical....... Even though Riana said it was okay......."

"You're staying there?"

"Uh."

Elayon Bolton is neither noble nor royalty, but he once held a very specialized position as a Crusader Knight Commander.

We had a hard time finding a place for someone as big as a crusader knight to retire and be treated properly.

Even Razak, a royal castle, is hardly a palace. It's a royal castle in a small province, so there's nothing to be done about it, but to the eyes of the empress, Charlotte, it looks like a tacky provincial lordship.

We forced Elion Bolton to retire at one point, and we wanted to give him a treat because we didn't want to upset him, but we didn't have a place to do it.

Charlotte and I were walking along a deserted road in the outskirts of Razak.

"The lady says she's fine, and Lord Bolton says he's fine, so what the hell, and Riana doesn't seem to be in any real danger from the way she's been talking."

"......, right?"

So Elayon Bolton found himself as a guest at the mansion outside of Razak, the home of Lyanna's mother, Duchess Yelena.

So there you have it.

The Duke of Granz's cottage, which I visited during my summer vacation in the Darklands my freshman year.

When the Senate was debating what to do about Elayon Bolton's residence, Riana blurted out that they could just let him stay there.

It's one of the many ducal villas on the continent, built at the height of the Duke of Granz's power, and we couldn't give it away.

In fact, neither Elion Bolton nor Duchess Yelena seemed to have any trouble getting along with each other.

But.......

something.......

Oh, no!

I can't tell you what's what!

I know it's not weird at all!

Maybe I'm being a little conservative!

That's a bit much!

"Seriously, what the hell are you thinking?"

"......."

Charlotte gave me a disapproving glance and stomped ahead.

Right?

Am I weird?



* * *



Technically, the residence of Riana's mother, the Duchess of Granz, is more opulent than Razak's castle.

This was not surprising, as the Dukes of Granz were far more powerful than the Edina royal family, a small state in the southern archipelago.

There's a difference between the great nobility of an empire and the royalty that was closer to the end of the line.

Being royalty doesn't necessarily put you above nobility. You can be a noble and a royal at the same time.

As the daughter of the Grand Duke of Saint-Antoine, Harriet was a noblewoman, but she wasn't exactly royalty.

The Duke of Granz's villa, which should no longer be called a villa but the main house.

As I walked down the path and came to a mansion with a view of the beach in front of me, I saw the back of someone's head.

A familiar back view.

"......What brings you here?"

Riana asked, glancing in my direction to see if I'd heard footsteps.

Then I cast my gaze toward Charlotte, who came with me.

"It's not private, seeing as you've brought the regent with you."

"Well, yeah."

I don't really have a reason to come here for anything personal.

I'll call you if I need something done, but it's rare that I'll be here.

"I'm here to see Lord Bolton."

"Oh, that guy."

The once prestigious and authoritative leader of the Crusader Knights is now just an old man in a restaurant.

No, I think Riana would have just called him Uncle, even if Bolton was an active Crusader.

Riana gestures toward the beach.

"Probably going for a walk."

"A walk?"

"I went with my mom, she'll be back in a bit."

Well.

"......!"

Before I could say anything, Charlotte pinched my side.

"......what are you doing?"

Riana cocked her head at Charlotte, who suddenly pinched her side.

"Huh? Oh, no, just?"

Charlotte smiled sheepishly and shrugged.
