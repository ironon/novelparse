Though she doesn't have the mesmerizing powers that characterize succubi, Airi doesn't seem to need them, running a bar and seducing local powerful men.

So that was the important step, and from there it was just a matter of moving forward," says Irie.

It's about tricking and deceiving people who have already won their hearts and taking their liver.

How are they going to deal with the maliciousness of people after all of this is done, and do they already have a plan for that?

Just as I take my own risks, Airi was taking her own risks, even if I didn't want her to.

"Hang in there, Valerie."

Airi smiles at me.

"Because it won't be long before I give you the Edina Archipelago."

It wants to monopolize trade and eventually swallow up the entire Edina Archipelago.

When I first met the succubus captives, I wanted them to live in peace.

When he said something about taking over an empire or something, I thought it would be okay to dream about that as long as I had some sort of purpose in life.

But watching Airi in action made me realize that it would never be possible to achieve that goal.

"My opinion is the same: don't do anything too risky."

"Okay, thanks for your concern."

Originally, the two of us would have been enemies, but after being saved by me, Airi changed her attitude towards me. At first, I didn't think much of her because I didn't know what her past was.

While checking in with Airi to see how she was doing on the Edina Archipelago, I learned some pretty crazy things.

If Airi succeeds in the Edina Archipelago, it will eventually have its own uses. What that use will be is unknown at this time.

"By the way, I'm here because I have a question."

And, finally, I could get to the point.

"What do you mean you're curious?"

"I'm going back to the Demon Castle soon, and I want to know what's there."

"......to the kingdom?"

"Uh."

"There are still Imperial troops there, even if you're disguised as a human......."

"We're going with imperial permission, so there's no problem with that."

"Oh, I see, but what are you trying to ask me....... Oh, that's right, I lost my memory and you were......."

Airi seemed to have a vague idea of what I wanted to find when I got back there.

"There's a quarantine station in Demon King's Castle that only royalty can enter, but I'm sure the humans have been through it all, and there's nothing left that's useful......."

Charlotte and Saviolin Tana decide to go to the Demon King's Castle, vaguely hoping that they might learn something.

But I want to figure out if there's anything left in the Demon Castle, even if it has nothing to do with saving Charlotte.

I'm sure there are still some people who have left the castle for grave robbing or research purposes, so even if I were in Reinhardt's form, it wouldn't be a place I could just walk into at random.

The time is now.

According to Airi, there are forbidden areas that only royalty can enter.

But the place wasn't physically barricaded, and if it's already been robbed, there's nothing to be gained there. Airi narrowed her brow in thought.

"I don't know. But I'm sure there are places in the Demon Castle that only demons are allowed to go, and I'm sure they're sealed off from the rest of us. ....... It's certainly possible that humans haven't found them yet."

Airi said she wasn't sure, but she thought it might be there.

"How do you know such a place exists?"

"...... once upon a time, the Great Demon King would take you to go somewhere in the Demon Kingdom."

Airi must have memories of Bali that I don't have, of what happened at Mawang Castle.

"I don't know where it is, and when I asked my mom, she wouldn't tell me at all, like it was a secret, but she seemed to know something."

"You mean there's a secret room for that kind of thing?"

"Probably. I don't know which place specifically, though."

The place where the Ancestor Demon used to take Valerie.

Airi's mother, a former Four Thousand King, knows something, but she won't tell Airi.

It's possible that humans have already found the place, but it's also possible that they haven't.

A secret area of the Demon Castle, where an old demon king used to take his son.

There should be something there.

I need to know that.

That was the end of my brief reunion with Airi.

"I can go for a few days."

Airi watched me wistfully as I turned to leave.

"Sorry, I'm out of time."

"......Yes.

Airi cautiously lowered her eyes.

Originally, Valier was an incompetent bastard who ran around like his father, and Airi, the daughter of a succubus queen, was in a position to teach him a lesson.

With the demons gone, we are the last remaining royalty of a fallen kingdom.

Airi walked over to me and held both my hands still.

"I hope you're okay, Valerie."

There was something about meeting that gaze that made me feel uncomfortable.

Maybe it's because the succubus queen race itself is so easy to love.

No.

It's not.

I'm not a volleyball player, but it was a strange feeling to feel like I was responding to a volleyball.

Valerie has been bullied by Airi, but somehow she instinctively knows.

An odd conviction that Valerie would have liked Airi.

It was the uncanny sensation of just looking into Airi's eyes that convinced me.

In the original history, Airi would have been enslaved by the empire, and Bali would have died wandering the wilderness.

Of course, I'm not in Bali.

Nor am I fascinated by a race called succubi.

So.

"Don't push yourself too hard."

"Yes."

I could only offer Airi my best wishes, including a sense of camaraderie.

Just as quickly as I went to the Edina Archipelago, I was back.

Lucinil offered to keep an eye on me if I wanted to go to Mawang, but I declined.

The area around the Demon Castle is already tightly held by human forces, and she has Saviolin Tana with her. If she and Lucinil crossed paths, strange things could happen.

So Lucinil decided it was better to stay in the ecliptic and help Sarkhegar with his mission.

There is a secret room in the Demon Castle.

But she doesn't know, and I don't know, where that place is.

And if I find it, I have to get in there without being seen, and I don't really have a plan for how to do that yet.

Fortunately, Charlotte's symptoms didn't worsen before we left for Mawang.

In the royal class dormitory, Saviolin Tana called out to me in private.

The time is night. Outside the Royal Class dormitory, Xavier and I are facing each other in the dimly lit space.

"His Majesty has granted permission; departure is in two days."

"Yes."

As I replied nonchalantly, Savior Tana suddenly grabbed my shoulder.

She looks me in the eye with a serious expression.

"Reinhard, I've asked you to come with me out of my own greed, but I don't think you realize the danger of this."

"......Risks?"

"Yes, the Empress is very negative about you going with her."

Charlotte thanked me, but I told her it was dangerous and she didn't have to come.

That's why I've been thinking about it for days.

Are you suggesting that there might be threats to the demon castle that we haven't yet fully grasped?

Charlotte is saying that I took too many risks and she's negative about going with me?

"If you're saying that Demon King is dangerous......."

"No, that's not the problem."

She shook her head, as if I was completely out of context.

"I don't care about politics, and I shouldn't, but I'm in a position where I basically don't have to get involved in it. That's not an ego thing, it's literally true."

The strongest knight on the continent.

If she wants to stay out of politics, she can, because of the influence and authority that alone gives her.

But not me.

I know, I know.

An underdog living in the middle of politics cannot be neutral. They can only be neutral if they eventually gain power or influence.

When I heard that it was politics, not physical danger, I knew what Saviolin Tana was talking about.

"Are you talking about....... about Bertus?"

"Yeah."

Bertus and Charlotte.

I had somewhat forgotten about the problems between them. Charlotte values me, and it's been a while since Bertus has tried to do anything to me.

"There are many people in the Demon City. And it's no secret that the Empress and I are headed there ourselves, so if you come with us, it will be known at some point."

"......."

If you go to the Demon Castle with Charlotte, Bertus will find out about it at some point.

Bertus realizes that I am firmly on Charlotte's side.

"You have already received the imperial crest. His Highness will soon learn that you are the master of Tiamata."

Plus the thing about Tuan's champion.

The fact that Ellen and I have both received imperial crests is not information that Bertus can miss.

It's clear that I'm on Charlotte's side, not to mention that I've been elevated in importance.

That would mean that by going to the demon castle, I would already have Bertus as a certain enemy in the future.

Saviolin Tana doesn't get caught up in politics, she just doesn't know it.

So I think he was trying to warn me because he thought I wasn't aware of the real dangers of doing this.

"For the last time, Reinhardt. It's strange to say this after I asked you to come, but if you think it's too dangerous, you don't have to come. The king would prefer it that way."

I don't think Charlotte wanted to put me in danger anymore.

If I go to the Demon Castle with Charlotte, I will have Bertus as a future enemy.

But what difference does it make if I stay put?

It should be known that I'm a champion of Tuan anyway.

I need to know what is left of the Demon Castle, as well as Charlotte's treatment.

And I know that Savior Tana and Charlotte's worries are unfounded.

The imperial crest given to me.

That in itself says it all.

"I don't think Bertus is stupid enough to lay a hand on Tuan's champion."

"......."

Royal treatment?

No, it's more than that.

I and Ellen are more important to humanity at this point in time than a prince and princess, or even the Emperor himself.

If you try to kill me or harm me for merely being on Charlotte's side, it will backfire on the wrathful Emperor.

You and Ellen are expendable in the fight against the demon, but until you are expendable, you are the most important person on the continent.

Lagan Artorius may not have used political advantage at all, but I won't.

Bertus will not touch me.

Unless it's something that will reveal my identity, you can't touch me.

"So I'm going to go."

But the moment Bertus becomes an enemy, I wonder if my identity won't be revealed.

We don't know that.

"......Yes, I'll pass that along to His Highness."

I know my destiny is coming, and I can't hide my identity forever.

Champion of Tuan.

It will protect me against all odds and circumstances.

I raised humanity's sense of urgency by exposing the remnants of the demonic world, and I gave myself the political cover to protect myself by claiming to be Tuan's champion.

On its face, it's a pretty nefarious way to position yourself as the savior of a crisis you helped create.

It turns out that Eleris was right when she said that Tiamata would have more political uses.

The day you decide to take off for Mawang.

"It's really okay, I won't be gone long, and I don't need you to be there......."

Charlotte trailed off with a depressed expression. I was grateful, but Charlotte always felt bad that I was always taking from her and never helping her.

It's a big risk to take, no matter how politically correct you are.

So even on the day of departure, there was a hint of wishing I wasn't there.

"Coming from a guy who came to me in his pajamas, crying and hanging on for dear life when the shit hit the fan."

"Mu, what?!"

Charlotte looked dumbfounded at my outburst. Saviolin Tana, who was preparing to start next to me, was also dumbfounded.

"There's no point in yelling at me when the shit hits the fan, so let's just go along for the ride."

"You, what are you talking about?!"

Charlotte's face flushed red and she began to berate me.

"Yeah, I'd rather be angry like this."

"......what?"

I'm more bothered by Charlotte looking like she's about to die of apologies.

"That makes me feel better."

Charlotte stared at me blankly, her lips quivering sweetly, and then she screamed.

"...... Really you. You're a weirdo for thanking people, then not thanking them, then thanking them again!"

Charlotte scowled and led the way, while Savior Tana looked at me and sighed.

"You're the one who doesn't mind talking about being arrested for blasphemy, but I'm the one who's used to your behavior."

Normally, you have to take the initiative by saying that you are safe, but now that I'm doing it, I'm just embarrassed, but I didn't take the initiative.

Saviolin Tana seemed to find it strange that she was getting used to my behavior.
