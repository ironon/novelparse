            Episode 513





Rumors have spread throughout the Alliance that the warrior, Ellen Artorius, has awakened another power.

They all marveled at the sight of the battlefield as the main body marched forward and the vanguard swept through the monsters.

A huge wave of flames poured from the sun's cloak protecting the warrior, sweeping the monsters away.

Lesser monsters are reduced to ash in waves of flame, while those that can withstand the flames are known for their Voidblades, which slice through anything.

The warrior was the judgment of the sun and moon, sweeping the waves of monsters from the front.

But the flames of hatred pouring from the sun's cloak did not shield Pia.

As such, no one could get in the middle of a fight that Ellen was sweeping away.

Most of the Allies were encouraged by the fact that the warriors had grown stronger.

When we say most, we mean not all, after all.

While everyone marvels at the warrior's majesty, the troops from the Temple who know Ellen are uncomfortable with the appearance of Ellen Artorius.

Something is wrong with Ellen.

He was already soft-spoken, but even more so than usual.

His eyes were glassy and unfocused, and he would occasionally grab his head and say strange things.

After marching, a reinstalled garrison.

The garrison was visited by the emperor and the popes of the five major orders.

Under the guise of improving the morale of the Crusaders as well as the Allies, the Emperor, unlike the Popes, had an ulterior motive.

He had come to check on Ellen Artorius after receiving a report from Saviolin Tana that she was not feeling well.

Ellen Artorius' Tent, inside the Temple Garrison.

"Ellen."

"......Yes."

Emperor Bertus was understandably disturbed by Ellen's condition.

Bertus sat across from her, staring blankly at Ellen, who was staring off into space with cloudy eyes.

At Bertus' side was only Saviolin Tana.

Ellen has awakened another power she hasn't been able to use until now.

But aside from being stronger, there was something seriously wrong with Ellen Artorius.

"You look like you're sick."

"......."

Everyone who knew Ellen saw her and asked how she was doing.

Are you sick, are you okay.

But every time Ellen heard that question, she shook her head.

She's just tired, she says. Ellen scanned her surroundings with cloudy eyes and a narrowed brow.

Like you want to see what's around you.

Ellen sees the figure of Bertus, and the figure of Tana, the violinist, standing beside him.

"Not long ago, I met....... Reinhardt."

Ellen still had a sense of self.



* * *



Bertus and Saviolin Tana know the truth about the Gate situation.

So Ellen decided it was okay to tell them what had happened.

Reinhardt was dying, and he took on the burden.

When I briefly explained what had happened, Bertus and Saviolin Tana were stunned.

A phenomenon caused by too many deaths. It overtook Reinhardt, and Ellen inherited it.

There was no way Ellen could be in her right mind.

"Call me irresponsible, but I can't help it....... I had to do it, I guess."

"......."

"......."

I had to save Reinhardt, Ellen mumbles in a dazed, almost stunned state.

Neither Bertus nor Tana could deny that it was reckless.

However, it's not like we don't recognize Ellen's desire to save Reinhardt in that situation.

"My ego will probably fade away, but it won't hurt people....... obviously."

Even if the self disappears, it does no harm to the humans who carry the hatred of the demon. You will only become a puppet with nothing but hatred for the demon.

When Ellen tells Bertus and Tana about her secret meeting with Reinhardt, it's not for any other reason.

Now that she's unleashed Rafelt's true power, Ellen is stronger.

"So, when the whole Gate thing is over....... kill me......."

After the gate incident, Ellen, with her self gone, is going to try to kill the Devil.

"Before I, Reinhardt, tried to kill you......."

So, let them die when they've served their purpose.

Ellen turned to Tana and Bertus.

"What is this."

"......."

-Currrrrrr!

An alchemical drug concocted by Lucinil from a recipe given to him by Herriot.

After eating it, Riana summoned three tornadoes to the beach in quick succession.

I don't know if this is correct or not, but it seemed like the only way to really bring out the power.

Of course.

"......."

It was very distressing to see Riana dead with a pale complexion.

"......Let's only use it when we really need it."

"I guess so......."

Riana nodded slowly in agreement with Lucinil's words.

It was a dangerous drug that was too sure to work.

I won't be able to trigger her abilities by grinding her to a pulp.

What to say.

Riana's struggle was almost painful to watch.

In a way, it looks like they're being punished.

In any case, the bottom line is clear.

After taking a depressant, Riana is invincible.



* * *



Riana's medication had a definite effect.

I don't know if you can call this a drug.

Not a pill to make you feel better, but a pill to make you depressed.

Can a drug be called a drug if it has the opposite effect?

In fact, I'd argue that it's what makes the drug worthy of its name.

They say it won't have any side effects, but I don't think you can use it very often because it's almost like it's a side effect.

The more you use it, the sicker it makes you.

That's probably why Herriot said not to wear it.

Riana focused on Herriot's words, not that she shouldn't wear it, but that it would have no side effects other than the potency itself.

Even when I wasn't looking, Riana was practicing with Lucinil on a deserted island, as if trying to get to the bottom of her abilities.

It's nice to have accelerated ability progression, but is it really a good thing?

Riana was abusing herself.

Olivia and the Lord Vampires were well on their way to selecting their elite and preparing for war.

From the moment we step forward, the army's march will accelerate, and the gate will be closed faster and faster.

And aside from preparing for war, other things were happening, one by one.

I was also fighting with Ellen in my dreams every other day.

Still, it didn't work.

If I'm not in the right frame of mind to hurt Ellen, I'm at a disadvantage.

The Voidblade Ramen will cut through everything it touches, except for holy objects.

Even if I became a masterclass, I was still lacking in overall specs, and I wasn't prepared for the fight.

I had to suffer a defeat that would end in one hundred and one, my death.

The pain I felt in my dreams in the moments leading up to my death was a bonus.

"This is already done?"

"Yeah. That wasn't that hard."

I stared open-mouthed at the milky white obelisk that replaced the fountain in Razak's main square.

People coming and going were looking at the suddenly erected obelisk and scratching their heads as if they wanted to know what it was, but they didn't really know what it was.

By my side were Harriet and Airi.

"The scribe's abilities are truly, truly amazing."

"Well, is that......."

Unaccustomed to compliments, Herriot scratched his cheek at Airi's words.

Obelisk of Dreams.

Herriot not only succeeds in interpreting the magic of his dreams, but also quickly succeeds in artifactualizing them.

I feel like I've been scribbling research notes for days, and now I'm trying to make this.

"We'll pilot it for now, and if it works well, we'll roll it out to other regions."

"Good."

I don't know how much a good night's sleep can mean at this time of year, but as someone who has had some pretty ferocious dreams, I'm sure it's something that will help people.



* * *



Interfering with dreams is not technically magic, but rather an ability unique to succubi.

Herriot's ability to turn them into artifacts was already beyond the capabilities of most archmages.

Herriot's capabilities are nowhere near what they were as a freshman.

You've gone from being one of the most talented geniuses in the history of magic, to being fully capable of it.

Oddly enough, it was Charlotte who helped Herriot develop the artifact so quickly.

In the past, when I've had to act as her assistant, she hasn't been able to take time for herself.

But Charlotte is doing a great job of doing what needs to be done without being an assistant, so Harriet can spend all her time doing what she wants to do.

But this.

This feels a little weird.

In the end, it's a good thing that Herriot is able to focus all of his time on his research.

It's nice that Charlotte has taken over everything I've been doing and is doing it better than I ever could.

But it was a little too objective to realize that I was being an idiot and taking up her time.

It's kind of like.

I have to admit, I'm feeling a little self-conscious.

"......."

"What's wrong?"

That night, as we sat in bed getting ready for bed, she looked at me and shook her head when I didn't say anything.

"......what?"

"Are you angry?"

"No, not at all."

"...... doesn't look happy."

I don't feel like I've offended you, and there's no reason to be upset. Technically, I wish it hadn't been implemented so quickly, but there's no reason to feel bad about it.

At my denial, Harriet glares at me.

Come to think of it.

I've spent the most time with Harriet since we took over Edina's government.

So, because he's spent so much time with me, he's the most sensitive to my mood swings.

Literally, I can fool anyone else, but I can't fool Herriot.

In the end, I couldn't help but sigh at the gaze.

"No, I'm just wondering if I've been taking up too much of your time."

"My time......?"

"Yeah, this is what you get for just this much focus, and if I could have run the country on my own, you could have done something else. Something more constructive and progressive. ....... What can I say, you could have done something that only you can do......."

Herriot was too good to be my assistant.

But everyone else around me was busy doing their own thing. I reluctantly let Harriet serve as my assistant, but she was an irreplaceable asset.

If Harriet hadn't been my assistant and had been working on her research, she could have been doing something greater, something that only she could do.

I wish I was a little better at it.

Now that Charlotte, whose qualities were clearly superior to my own, had taken the reigns, I could not help but think of what I could have accomplished in the time that had already passed.

"What the....... was that?"

"I know it's a dumb question, but what can I do about it?"

I sighed, and Harriet smiled wryly.

"Well....... Hmm......."

Harriet squats on her bed, contemplating.

"What I could have done if I had been doing something else....... I honestly don't know, because I was busy, just like you were busy."

"......."

"Still, I liked it."

Harriet looks at me as she says that.

"It was nice to be close to you."

"......Yes."

It leaves me speechless.

I couldn't bring myself to look at Herriot's face.

"Just because I could have done something else doesn't mean that the work we did together is gone, and just because Charlotte can do what we did faster and better doesn't mean that the work we've somehow done is worthless."

"......Yes."

Yes, you're right.

Age seems to have become irrelevant at some point.

At some point, I realize that I'm relying too much on the people around me, and in some ways, they're wiser than I am.

Not to mention being nice to listen to.

It may not mean anything to you, but that's what people need.

Herriot was, and still is, the closest thing to me.

Herriot said he's glad he did.

Aside from the practical efficiency and other possibilities.

I'll admit, I liked it.

From that point on, Herriot was dedicated to me.

I mean, they were trying to give me everything.

When she finished, she went back to writing in her journal.

Now that she doesn't have to act as my assistant, she's still busy.

I keep trying to find something to do.

"But why don't you take it easy? Do you have any more work to do?"

"I guess we'll have to wait and see about the obelisk, but not much else."

"Anything else?"

"I'm learning about the art of betrothal, Lord of Demand."

Engagement.

You're suddenly learning the art of seduction from Lucinil in the middle of all this? At my question, Harriet looked at me and smiled sadly.

"Ellen, you're going to have to get it back somehow."

"ah......."

I felt my breath catch in my throat.

"This is what we had to do because we ran out of time. There might have been another way."

"......."

"I don't want to forget that Ellen took on everything."

Harriet writes in her research journal.

"Ellen is also my friend."

It was Herriot, not Antony, who suggested that Ellen shoulder the burden.

Ellen is also a friend of Harriet's.

I had forgotten the obvious for far too long.

She's been writing in her journal for a while and suddenly looks back at me.

"So don't try to thank me."

"Uh......?"

"Well, that makes me feel bad."

To Herriot's question, I had no answer.
