            Episode 511.





After twenty, I stopped counting.

I've never been able to subdue Ellen.

The amplified pain in the dream was more painful than the actual wound, but it didn't wake him up. Airi was artificially controlling it.

-currrrr

So when I woke up, I could see that the morning sky was cloudy and thunderous.

A storm is brewing.

I could feel Airi's hand still on mine, where it had been just before I fell asleep.

"Good morning....... Morning. You must not have slept well......."

Airi would have had to focus on my dreams, so she wouldn't have slept at all. Airi's expression wasn't too happy either, probably because she kept seeing me dying miserably in her dreams.

Putting aside the question of whether or not this is a good idea, I woke up in the morning with one clear side effect.

"Well, this....... I don't feel like sleeping at all."

"No wonder......."

I woke up and I'm tired.

It's a no-brainer.

After all, dreams aren't meant to last for hours.

But I had the nightmare for the entire time I was asleep, so I was dazed, like my brain was overloaded.

It's more like a side effect of your brain doing extra work while you're asleep.

If I keep doing this, I'm going to be exhausted and unable to push myself when I really need to push myself.

Every day seems a little overwhelming, and I think I need to take a break every other day or two.

On the bed across from him, Harriet was asleep, hugging a large pillow.

"Ugh....... Reinhard......."

Airi hugs her pillow hard, wondering what she's dreaming about, even though she's not the one who touched it.

My Paxton, sometimes you're so cute I want to bite you.

"Do you think this....... work?"

Airi asked, keeping her voice low so as not to wake Herriot.

I was killed dozens of times in one night. And the pain in his dreams was worse than the pain in real life.

After feeling a different kind of spiritual pain, almost devoured by spirits, I guess this is okay.

Just because you've been in pain doesn't mean a little pain isn't pain.

Luna said.

If it's easy to get better, it's easy to get hurt.

It hurts so badly, it's obviously the wrong thing to do from Luna's point of view to try to ignore the pain.

I know that pain now won't buy me happiness later.

It's obvious.

But I can't think of any other way to do it.

To avoid seeing that future I saw in the preview, where Ellen ends up killing me and I end up killing myself.

"I have a feeling it's a necessary evil."

"......I see."

I, for one, am about to die a lot.

"By the way, get some more sleep."

"Uh......?"

"Still, you should get some sleep."

Airi puts her hand on my forehead again.

I didn't feel like I slept at all, which means I need to get some real sleep.

It's hard enough to give someone you care about a nightmare on purpose.

I could have resisted all I wanted, but I surrendered my consciousness to the touch.

"This time, I'm not going to let you dream."

In fact, Airi and I both knew that the best sleep is when you don't dream at all.



* * *



The most elite of the Demon King's forces began to assemble.

The Lords of the Vampire Council and the vampires under their command.

Priests and paladins of the Holy Order.

And an army that includes some of the mightiest of demons.

As a force that needs to maximize its mobility due to mass teleportation, it is not large in numbers, but an elite force of very strong individuals is beginning to form.

The Lord Vampire Houses, the Holy Order's Prelate Olivia Ranze, and Regent Charlotte select their elite soldiers.

He will lead them to clear a path of march for the armies of humanity.

Their vanguard, unbeknownst to humanity, was being organized.

-Rumble

Razak was hit by an unexpected storm.

The waves were rising, and it was getting harder to steer the boat.

The docks were bustling with activity, with ships being anchored more securely to prevent the fleet from being swept away, and the mermaids who gathered the ocean's resources had also slowed down.

A cottage in the outskirts of such and such a Rajak.

The beach in front of it.

"Daughter, why are you getting soaked in the rain?"

Duchess Yelena de Granz.

The woman, no longer a duchess but merely Yelena de Granz, approached her daughter, who was sitting idly on the beach in the rain, and asked.

"......."

Her daughter, better known by her nickname, King Brain, said nothing, just stared blankly at the waves in the distance.

Because of his duties at Fort Mokna, he saw his mother very little.

And since it's not her job to organize an army at this point, she has nothing to do until further orders from the Demon King.

So Riana was now on a non-vacation at her mother's mansion outside of Razak, one of the many villas that the Duke of Granz once owned across the continent.

The first summer vacation at the Temple. Riana spent a few days at the mansion with her friends.

I can't go back to that time. Everything has changed too much.

The word vacation is foreign to Riana.

I can't remember the last time I took a proper break.

You worked hard.

I tried to work hard at everything. I felt like I had to do something, that there was no such thing as time to relax.

There were many moments where she was faced with important choices, and she made them.

And the consequences of that choice.

Riana had created yet another huge disaster in a sad world, and she could do nothing about it.

Olivia Lanzaga.

Reinhardt.

Ellen Artorius finishes.

I have taken over and taken over the things that stem from Riana's sins.

There was nothing Riana could do about it.

Yelena looks at her daughter, who is staring blankly at the beach.

She has no title or authority in Edina. However, by order of the King, she has been granted a certain standard of living and bodyguards, though not as much as she had as a Duchess.

Of course, Yelena knows what her daughter is doing and how important she is.

Your daughter, whom you rarely see, stares blankly at the beach as soon as she gets home.

It's raining so hard, and I'm just standing there in the rain.

It's hard to tell how much guilt is in her eyes, but she eventually puts the umbrella down.

Then she sits down next to her daughter, who sits dazed.

"Riana."

"......Yes."

"Is it hard?"

"......."

At her mother's question, Riana turns her head slightly to look at her.

"I don't deserve to struggle."

"......."

"You can't tell me I'm struggling."

Riana says, and turns her attention back to the beach. Jelena places a gentle hand on her daughter's wet shoulder.

"It's so hard that you have to say that."

"......."

"If it's hard, it's okay to cry."

It's hard enough to say that you don't deserve to struggle.

It's okay to cry if it's hard.

Riana shakes her head at her mother's words.

"I can say that because I'm a mom."

"I can say that because she's my mom."

"Anyone else would have said....... I wouldn't say that."

"I don't deserve to cry."

A mother and daughter who had a terrible relationship.

However, after the death of Duke Granz, things have changed since the Gate incident.

After all, they are the only two blood relatives left in the world.

How sad that is.

What a relief that is.

They are now sadly aware of that fact.

Yelena doesn't know why her daughter is having such a hard time.

"Yeah, I don't know, I don't know why you're doing this, but I guess I can say this because I'm a mom. Because I'm a mom."

Yelena doesn't know what her daughter did.

But you can read something in those eyes.

Indelible guilt.

"I mean, no matter what you've done, no matter how unforgivable you've been. No matter what you've done, no matter how much you've wronged......."

"I'm your mom."

"Because you are my daughter."

"It's okay to cry in front of your mom."

"Even if you can't forgive yourself."

"Even if you don't think you deserve to cry."

"It's okay to cry in front of your mom."

"That's why we're family."

At that, Riana looks at Yelena.

Rhianna, who didn't allow herself to cry because she didn't think she deserved it.

He still can't forgive himself and doesn't know how to come to terms with the many deaths and harms he caused.

I've killed countless people with my own hands.

It killed a lot of people.

-currrrr

On a stormy beach, Riana eventually broke down in front of her mother's smile.

"Mom......."

"Yes."

"You have committed the unpardonable....... sin."

"I see."

"Unforgivable, I thought. Worse than I thought....... Worse than I hoped....... More than I could have ever imagined....... has happened."

Yelena held her daughter still as she began to squirm, her face contorted into a hideous contortion.

"I see......."

"Mom....... Me....... I am....... I don't know how, what to do....... I don't know......."

Yelena couldn't give her daughter the answer.

"If I....... I don't know if I hate something after all, if I'm trying to avenge my dad, if it's okay to be me....... I don't know anymore......."

All I can do is hold her in my arms as she cries with guilt and cry with her.

"That's what I thought....... My daughter. That's what I was thinking....... you were thinking......."

Holding her daughter in her arms, Yelena de Granz brushes her daughter's wet hair and back in the rain.

No answers, no advice, no nothing.

But you can hold them and cry with them.

That's what family is.

"Hmph....... 으흐흑......."

Thunder King (雷鳴王).

Liana de Granz faints in her mother's arms.

The tears that the lightning-wielding psychic has been holding back finally spill out.

Then the sky starts to open up.

The dark clouds have lifted, and the sun is shining through them, a deceptive sight.

It's a muddled image created by real tears, shed from the heart.

The storm created by her powers dissipated in Riana's fever.

Yelena and Riana could only stare at the lying landscape through their tears.

She was Liana de Granz, who learned to control lightning in a fit of rage.

In her grief and guilt, Riana's abilities took another step forward.



* * *



"Uh....... What?"

I could only stare in disbelief for a moment as Riana spoke.

"The last storm, it stopped suddenly."

"You did, I guess?"

The storm came out of nowhere, rumbled on for a few days, and then suddenly tore the sky apart.

This was a very strange phenomenon and caused quite a stir amongst myself and Razak.

Then Riana came by and said she suddenly thought it was her.

"So the storm ended because of me. I don't know if the storm started because of me in the first place......."

"......."

"I know it sounds crazy, I know."

I can see the doubt in her eyes, wondering if the chain of events has caused her to lose her mind. Riana blushed and muttered something incoherent.

"But the timing is....... I don't know what to do with that."

"What's with the timing?"

"That....... Well....... that......."

Riana hesitantly began to explain to me what had happened over the past few days.

Eventually, Riana's eyes widened and she started to sob, unable to wipe the guilt from her face, unable to stop feeling sorry for herself.

Despite all of this, Riana would have been miserable.

It would have been painful to the point of wanting to die.

It was quite painful to see that side of Riana, who had always been strong and tough.

Riana's explanation was long, but it boiled down to this.

I hugged my mom and sobbed, and the storm stopped.

"Gee, really....... I know that's really weird, but the timing of that....... like that!"

Riana's eyes were bright red, her face flushed, and she shouted, then suddenly shrank back.

"That, that....... That's not something I should be upset about. Sorry......."

"Just be yourself, as usual. I don't want to blame you, and I don't want to see you different."

It's more uncomfortable to see her slumped over like this.

"Hmmm....... So we need to verify that you can control the weather, or that you're a psychopath who thinks he can control the weather."

"The horse is......! Do you want the horse to do that?"

"Well, I can see that you're definitely not in the right frame of mind in terms of losing your temper."

The way her anger flared up and then she couldn't even take a picture because she was so sorry for me, I knew she wasn't normal.

"Come with me, I think I need to check it out."

I take Riana's arm and lead her.

"If you can really control the weather, why don't you do it here?"

People will say the sky is falling.



* * *



It's also possible that Riana is mistaken.

The knot in my stomach manifested itself in the form of a storm, and the moment it was released, the weather cleared.

I'm sure if someone told me that, I'd introduce them to Airi. You're clearly mentally ill and need to get some counseling.

But it wasn't just anyone who said that, it was Liana de Granz.

In the original, Riana's abilities were specific to the Blitz, but as the story progressed, her abilities became more than just the Blitz itself.

It's now possible to stick a wing in dry air.

Thunderbolt.

A blast from the sky.

Soon the sky.

It's not out of the realm of possibility that Riana's abilities could evolve into weather-related abilities.

If Riana's ability has indeed evolved to cause weather changes, there's no telling how she might use it later.

But we need to check it out first.

Of course, you need to know that you can cause weather changes and to what extent.

Since we can't do this in Razak, we'll need to go somewhere off the beaten path.

"Deserted island?"

"Yeah, I need to check on something."

So, I took Riana to find Lucinil.



* * *



Since the Edina Archipelago is a collection of islands, there were many uninhabited islands in the first place.

One of the unnamed islands, which is quite a distance from the inhabited islands.

After getting information from the mermaids about the deserted island and confirming the coordinates, Lucinil cast Mass Teleport and traveled with them.

"It's a nice view."

In the first place, it's a place where the emerald waters shine.

In my Temple days, I used to come here for summer vacations.

The disconnect between this soothing landscape and the real work I have to do and what's happening on the continent is strange to me.

"But what are you going to do on a desert island?"

Lucinil tilted her head as if to say, "I'm here because you asked me to, but what are you going to do?

I look at Riana.

"I heard that Riana's superpowers might be more advanced, so I'm going to find out."

"More advanced?"

Lucinil shook his head, as if summoning a lightning bolt was already an impressive feat, and there was nothing more to be gained from it.

Yeah, I'm wondering about that too.

You've found a deserted island, but it's a sunny beach just like any other vacation spot.

"Let's do whatever it is."

At my words, Riana scratches her cheek in confusion.

"Well, you know what......."

"What is that?"

"No, I'm saying....... Before I told you....... you wouldn't have tried to do it yourself......."

a.

I think I know what the problem is.

"......I don't know how to use it?"

"......."

Riana has some awareness that her powers have improved, but she doesn't know how to use them yet. It's not impossible that it's actually just a coincidence.

"ugh......."

Riana concentrates on the shimmering emerald waters.

-Flash!

I could see hundreds of thunderbolts streaking across the sky and slamming into the ocean.

The flash of a thunderbolt piercing a very distant ocean.

And.

-Currrrrr!

Deafening thunder rumbled in my ears, staggered by time.

A thunderbolt in dry air, a few moments of concentration, and you've got hundreds of them.

The aggressiveness of Riana's abilities ranges from good to disastrous.

"This isn't it."

"......So."

Riana nods shakily at my words.

Awesome is awesome, but what you need to do is change the weather, not summon lightning.

"Something....... that feels like it can do something, but also feels like it can't....... It's a really weird feeling."

The origin and workings of psychic powers are unknown, even to the psychics themselves.

So Riana was in a state where she felt like she could do it, but she had no clue.

Lucinil is an archmage, but he doesn't know anything about psychic powers, so he just shakes his head.

-blink, blink, blink, blink!

In the end, Riana fought for a long time, sending thunderbolts into the sea.

It looked like it wanted to summon something other than lightning, but no matter how hard I tried, it wouldn't show up.

-Currrrrr!

It must have been twenty minutes or so.

"But, Archdemon."

"Yes, my lord."

"I know lightning strikes at sea level and nothing happens, but....... what if mermaids stick their heads out to see what's going on and get struck by lightning?"

"Uh, yeah?"

"......!"

Just in case.

A lightning strike in the ocean isn't going to kill the fish, but it might electrocute some mermaids who happen to stick their heads out.

Eventually, the three of us, including Riana, sat down on the beach.

"Just....... Was I mistaken......?"

Riana began to seriously consider that she might be a psychopath who believes she can cause weather changes.

Lucinil was understandably dumbfounded.

"But you know....... and when you could summon lightning......."

"Uh, ah....... Yeah."

With the death of her father, Riana is able to summon lightning.

And if Riana did indeed awaken a new power, it would be a new power triggered by some emotional state.

"So, if you're going to be able to wield a new power from some emotion......."

"So I just need to get into that emotional state?"

It was Lucinil, not Riana, who picked up where I left off.

"If a superpower is the ability to respond to emotions, then this time you were able to change the....... weather change, you should be in a similar state to what you were then, right?"

Lucinil says, smiling broadly.

"Then let's make it feel like that."

Me.......

By the way.

He must have been in a very bad mental state.

Isn't it painful to have to artificially put yourself in that state?

Riana's complexion turned an earthy color when she heard Lucinil's suggestion.

I wouldn't say I'm in a great state of mind right now, but I'm in a great state of mind on purpose.

You were probably feeling depressed or something not unlike that.

If you're in a situation like that, and you've caused the weather to change without realizing it, you're being depressed on purpose.

And to send Riana into a downward spiral of depression.

It's pretty easy when you think about it.

About five minutes of watching Riana grimace, unable to do this or that.

"Hey."

"......?"

"Help?"

Riana tilted her head at my offhand remark.

"You're helping....... What?"

"Enough details, help?"

Riana didn't seem to have a clue what I was talking about.

"If you can help....... would be great......."

"Um, yeah."

I grab Riana by the shoulders and look him in the eye.

"Don't take what I'm about to say the wrong way, I'm trying to help you. Okay?"

"Uh......? No, what the hell are you talking about......."

"It's all because of you."

Riana is broken.





512





Riana squatted on the beach, head down, speechless.

-Rumble

"I don't think that's a coincidence, do you?"

"......Yes."

The sky, which had just been a brilliant blue, was now dark with dark clouds, and I could hear thunder rumbling in the clouds.

If there's anyone in Edina right now who could kill Riana with words, it's me.

It's all because of you.

With those words, Riana stared blankly at the grains of sand on the beach.

I'm not serious.

Riana wanted to find out for herself if she could really change the weather when she was in an extreme mood, so she said something she didn't mean.

And that back view.

That's what you were thinking.

It's more painful to me.

Riana stares at the sand for a long time, then lifts her head to look up at the blackened sky.

I can't help but notice that it's definitely working.

How long has it been.

Riana gets up, dead-eyed, and walks over to me.

"Some more."

"......?"

"More, say something."

No.

I know what you're thinking!

"...... is so perverted you guys."

Lucinil looks back and forth between the dead-eyed Riana and me with an exasperated expression.

"Is ...... okay?"

I'd do it if I had to, but I'm afraid I'd be stomping all over Riana's already half-dead psyche.

It looks like it's going to crumble if you tap it.

"No, it's not good, it's not good, I want you to do more."

It's definitely working, so beat it some more.

Is this okay?

As I listened, I wondered if Riana was going to strangle herself.

Tearing a kid's mind apart verbally, even if it's for the sake of awakening their abilities, when they're already mentally unhinged....... I already did it, but is it okay to do more than this?

"......Okay."

After all, Riana is asking for it.

In the end, hearing some words of rebuke from me may be part of the process for Riana to come to terms with herself.

Maybe it's better to be criticized than to hear nothing at all.

I don't know, but Riana may need my criticism, regardless of her awakened powers.

I got yelled at, and I paid the price.

I don't think so, but it might make her feel a little better.

I sat down next to her, leaving Riana in the sand for now.

And talk about things that are terrible to say.

"To be honest, it's not all you."

Once you've decided to do it, you don't want to do it in moderation.

"This is what happened because of this and that, right?"

"......."

"Well, a lot of people died, and....... Olivia's sister had a rough go of it, and I almost died, too......."

"......."

"Later, it became a matter of me killing Ellen, or me having to kill Ellen......."

"......."

"So, for the past few days, I've been having nightmares about Ellen killing me on purpose, so that I won't be so easily killed later."

"......."

"So....... all of this."

"......."

"How did this happen, and is it all because of you?"

Riana's lips quirk up.

Eventually, Riana burst into tears, her whole body shaking.

"Sorry....... Sorry....... Sorry....... Sorry, Reinhard......."

Even though she knew I was doing this on purpose, she couldn't help but be distracted by my words.

"I....... I did it all wrong....... It's all my fault. It's all, it's all my fault....... It's all because of me......."

I put my hand on Riana's shoulder as she shivers, and whisper in his ear.

"You said it's all your fault. You didn't say you did anything right, did you?"

Never.

"Well, what did you do right?"

"Black....... ugh....... ugh! ugh......! ugh!"

I didn't want to do anything half-assed.

Soon, it started to rain.

-Kurrrrrr

The rain soon became a storm.



* * *



-Shoot!

A storm was brewing with fierce winds.

The waves roared, and the thunderclouds raged, sending sharp bolts of thunder to the earth.

At this point, it's clear.

Riana is right to realize that she has the ability to control the weather.

Not even a goblin.

When you cry, it rains.

I stand on the beach, facing the raging sea and the pounding rain.

-Hey, you know Valerie doesn't really think that way.

-Ah, I know....... I know....... I know. I know....... I know....... ugh....... Ugh.......

-Uh-oh. Let's be gentle with him. You've completely destroyed him.

Lucinil had Riana under a palm tree and was patting her back, trying to soothe her somehow.

You realize you've said more than that.

But maybe that's what she needed.

Riana didn't pay for her mistake, and she couldn't be held accountable for anything that happened because of it.

So even a little.

Even if it's a rebuke or an accusation.

I'd rather hear something like this than have to pay a small price for it.

It doesn't make me feel any better, but I wonder what it means to be blamed for it.

A storm is brewing, a thunderstorm is brewing.

The harsh sound of the wind against my skin, the raindrops hitting my face in the wind.

Weather changes.

Is that it?

Is that it?

I stand in front of Riana, who is sitting under a palm tree, with Lucinil petting her.

"Archdemon, stop......."

Reading the determination in my expression, Rusinil shook his head in pity.

But I don't intend to stop.

"Riana."

"......Yes."

Riana struggles to lift her head and looks at me.

"Wake up."

"Stop it, you've checked, what else are you going to do here, huh?"

Lucinil shook her head, grabbing Riana by the collar as she tried to get up at my command.

We know that weather changes are possible.

Riana's abilities have evolved.

Riana's expression was miserable and desperate as she tried to hold back her tears somehow.

"What the hell am I going to do with this?"

"......."

"Pull it out a little more."

I point to the beach.

"What difference does it make if we make it rain a little bit?"

Can rain kill monsters?

Can you kill monsters with wind?

Lightning was originally a power that could be used.

"Some more."

"......."

"Show me something more useful."

"......."

"If you're going to take responsibility for what you've done, you're going to have to show me something more useful than this."

"......."

"Do you think that's enough?"

"......No."

Riana shakes her head in disbelief.

I don't know if that's what he meant or not.

Riana has blossomed a new ability, and it's definitely no ordinary one.

But Riana found a new use for herself and reported it to me.

Then some more.

Something more substantial, something more practical, something more useful.

More disruptive.

There should be such a thing.

I said something I didn't mean to say to provoke Riana.

But not from now on.

"Show me. If it's not there, make it happen."

I'm serious.

"If you're going to be held accountable for what you've done, you're going to have to show me something more than this, am I right?"

"Valerie, you are!"

Lucinil finally gets impatient and grabs the hem of my shirt.

"Well."

"......."

Meeting my gaze, Lucinil froze, unable to say anything more to me.

"Am I wrong, answer me."

"......You're right."

You can't kill a monster with a rainstorm.

So something, something bigger.

Something more destructive.

"If you know, do it."

Is it possible to be responsible for sin?

I don't know.

But Riana and I are alive and we've decided to do something about it.

This requires strength.

If hope is power, then we must find it.

If anger is empowering, then you should embrace it.

If desperation is strength.

You should eat despair.

At my harsh command, Riana stares at the beach with dead eyes.

I don't know if it was the power of my words or the despair and depression that my words stirred in Riana.

-Currrrrrrr!

In the distance, I could see a giant molten rock rising, sucking up the seawater.

Lucinil stared at the disaster, open-mouthed, beyond the overwhelming weather phenomenon.

I didn't settle for a storm, and when I dug a little deeper, I found this power.

Power enough to cause a disaster beyond a storm.

Riana may be the most powerful psychic of them all.

That's it.

I'll need to get more comfortable with the force here before I can use it in the real world.

By the way.

But you know what?

"That....... I know that's not what you're going to say after all this shit......?"

"......?"

I could feel Riana's panic as my tone returned to normal after all the commanding and berating.

No.

I tried to get the ability out somehow, and it's good that I did.

-Currrrr!

I could practically feel the violent storms generated by the giant lava flows.

"Can you get rid of that....... Can you get rid of that?"

I was thinking about pulling it out, but not at all about how to get rid of it.

Riana and I lock eyes.

"......."

"......."

It's no wonder I'm helpless, and it's no wonder she's helpless.

Even if it's a deserted island.

What the heck is going to happen when that tornado touches down in a populated area?

Eventually, the last card.

I couldn't help but look at Lucinil the Archmage.

"Well, my lord. Can't you do something with your magic?"

"...... I know the magic of calling a tornado, but do I know the magic of dismantling a naturally occurring tornado, and the magic of calling a tornado can't even bring me back from the dead on that scale."

Lucinil was equally helpless.

In the end, it comes back to the basics.

This is a weather phenomenon created in response to Riana's depressive imagery.

That said, once Riana's sanity is restored, the storm and the maelstrom disappear.

"You do realize this was all just talk, right?"

"......."

Riana's face contorts at my words, and she begins to burst into tears again.

That's it.

You know, the one where you get scolded by your parents and can't even cry, but when they pat you on the back, you burst into tears.

"ugh....... Ugh....... Hmph!"

"Whoops, yeah. Cry. I felt bad."

I start patting Riana on the back. Lucinil, drenched in rain, looks at me with a frightened expression.

"Bali, are you really....... You're a real piece of shit."

"......."

Anyway, me and Lucinil soothed Riana all the way through.

Fortunately, the molten metal quickly dissipated.

The storm continued to fall.



* * *



Since we still had quite a bit of time before deployment, Riana, Rusinil, and I were able to spend a little more time training on the desert island.

Of course, we weren't eating and sleeping on a deserted island. I'm training with a mass-teleporting archmage, and there's no reason why I should be.

"You go home and sleep tonight."

"......home?"

"Go to your mother's and sleep. Come to the castle tomorrow before noon."

I instructed Riana, who looked puzzled. Riana shook her head, her expression still grim, as if it was necessary.

"Go hold your mom's hand and go to sleep. Why do you have to be in a bad mood all the time, even if it's the strength that comes from being in a bad mood?"

"I'm just doing this for ......, aren't you?"

"How did you know?"

I chuckled, and Riana looked like she was going to cry again.

I'm rather impressed with your puns, as usual.

"Yeah, I'm going to go home and cuddle with my mom because I'm depressed, dammit."

Riana smiled wistfully, almost self-deprecatingly, and strode off.

"Hah, powers that come from being depressed. Being a superpower is complicated."

"Still, it's better than no power."

"......Yes."

Lucinil looked wistfully after Riana as she walked away.



* * *



That night.

"Riana?"

"Uh."

Today was one of those days when I didn't call for Airi, so it was just me and Harriet in the bedroom.

"Manipulating weather events....... That's crazy."

Harriet sat up in bed, her eyes shining with excitement as she scribbled in her journal.

You can even call a tornado.

But it doesn't end there, and Riana's abilities certainly have more potential.

You can make it cloudy, you can make it rain, you can make it snow, you can make it hail.

Taking it a step further, what about natural disasters like earthquakes?

We don't know the full extent of Riana's superpower potential.

For now, we'll focus on developing Riana's abilities until she's ready to go.

"So Riana's powers only manifest when she's depressed?"

"Uh, so the harsh words made me feel like I was depressing not only her, but also myself."

"Harsh words?"

"What....... You know, this thing......."

"ah......."

Herriot nodded wearily, as if he knew what she meant without being told in detail.

Not for me, who had to say it, not for Riana, who had to hear it, and not for Lucinil, who had to watch it unfold.

We couldn't hammock each other.

"That must have been hard....... You, too, Riana."

I couldn't help but feel horrible, wondering if I'd have to do this again tomorrow.

She was writing something down in her journal, thinking about it, writing it down again, thinking about it, writing it down again.

"Well, ....... But, come to think of it, do I really need to?"

Harriet looks at me as if she's remembered something.

"Do you have to....... What, do you have to say something you don't like?"

"Yeah, do I have to?"

"I couldn't care less because it seems to give me strength when I'm depressed......."

"No, if being depressed is a condition, I don't need you to....... say something you don't even want to say."

"So how do you make it depressing?"

This whole situation is weird and awful in and of itself, seriously talking about how to make your friends depressed, but this.

"I thought medication would be enough?"

"......?"

What is.

What does that mean?

"Wouldn't it be enough to mix up a mood-lowering drug? Why do you have to say such....... hurtful things to say."

"No, that....... that....... bad?"

The word "medication" makes me cringe, so I couldn't help but think that Harriet's words sounded harsh.

"As long as there are no side effects."

"......, right?"

"A drug that makes you feel depressed, except for the addictive part and stuff. I guess there's nothing you can't do if you want to make it."

While Christina was responsible for the creation of the Moonshine, which, in retrospect, is the secret of alchemy, Herriot played a role in the creation of the Power Cartridge as well as the Moonshine.

So it stands to reason that Herriot must have some knowledge of alchemy as well.

Herriot scribbled something in his research journal, then tore off a page and handed it to me.

"I'll show it to the Lord of Demand, and he'll know what it is, so you can mix it up and feed it to him."

"Well, it's still medicine....... Are you sure you're okay?"

"...... You don't believe me?"

"That's not true, but......."

At the mention of drugs, Harriet's eyes widen in horror.

If you're going to beat me up and make me depressed, you might as well do it with drugs, because when the drugs wear off, I'll feel better.

If Herriot is right, and there are no side effects, I think this might be exactly what Riana needs.

No.

But to be prescribed antidepressants instead of antidepressants later in life is just ridiculous.

Is this right?

"As with all medicines, long robes are a no-no, just so you know."

With that, Harriet turned her attention back to her journal.

Power is nice, but you can't hurt someone with words like this.

They'll just end up eating each other.

So use drugs instead.

That was Herriot's prescription.





第 513 集





Rumors have spread throughout the Alliance that the warrior, Ellen Artorius, has awakened another power.

They all marveled at the sight of the battlefield as the main body marched forward and the vanguard swept through the monsters.

A huge wave of flames poured from the sun's cloak protecting the warrior, sweeping the monsters away.

Lesser monsters are reduced to ash in waves of flame, while those that can withstand the flames are known for their Voidblades, which slice through anything.

The warrior was the judgment of the sun and moon, sweeping the waves of monsters from the front.

But the flames of hatred pouring from the sun's cloak did not shield Pia.

As such, no one could get in the middle of a fight that Ellen was sweeping away.

Most of the Allies were encouraged by the fact that the warriors had grown stronger.

When we say most, we mean not all, after all.

While everyone marvels at the warrior's majesty, the troops from the Temple who know Ellen are uncomfortable with the appearance of Ellen Artorius.

Something is wrong with Ellen.

He was already soft-spoken, but even more so than usual.

His eyes were glassy and unfocused, and he would occasionally grab his head and say strange things.

After marching, a reinstalled garrison.

The garrison was visited by the emperor and the popes of the five major orders.

Under the guise of improving the morale of the Crusaders as well as the Allies, the Emperor, unlike the Popes, had an ulterior motive.

He had come to check on Ellen Artorius after receiving a report from Saviolin Tana that she was not feeling well.

Ellen Artorius' Tent, inside the Temple Garrison.

"Ellen."

"......Yes."

Emperor Bertus was understandably disturbed by Ellen's condition.

Bertus sat across from her, staring blankly at Ellen, who was staring off into space with cloudy eyes.

At Bertus' side was only Saviolin Tana.

Ellen has awakened another power she hasn't been able to use until now.

But aside from being stronger, there was something seriously wrong with Ellen Artorius.

"You look like you're sick."

"......."

Everyone who knew Ellen saw her and asked how she was doing.

Are you sick, are you okay.

But every time Ellen heard that question, she shook her head.

She's just tired, she says. Ellen scanned her surroundings with cloudy eyes and a narrowed brow.

Like you want to see what's around you.

Ellen sees the figure of Bertus, and the figure of Tana, the violinist, standing beside him.

"Not long ago, I met....... Reinhardt."

Ellen still had a sense of self.



* * *



Bertus and Saviolin Tana know the truth about the Gate situation.

So Ellen decided it was okay to tell them what had happened.

Reinhardt was dying, and he took on the burden.

When I briefly explained what had happened, Bertus and Saviolin Tana were stunned.

A phenomenon caused by too many deaths. It overtook Reinhardt, and Ellen inherited it.

There was no way Ellen could be in her right mind.

"Call me irresponsible, but I can't help it....... I had to do it, I guess."

"......."

"......."

I had to save Reinhardt, Ellen mumbles in a dazed, almost stunned state.

Neither Bertus nor Tana could deny that it was reckless.

However, it's not like we don't recognize Ellen's desire to save Reinhardt in that situation.

"My ego will probably fade away, but it won't hurt people....... obviously."

Even if the self disappears, it does no harm to the humans who carry the hatred of the demon. You will only become a puppet with nothing but hatred for the demon.

When Ellen tells Bertus and Tana about her secret meeting with Reinhardt, it's not for any other reason.

Now that she's unleashed Rafelt's true power, Ellen is stronger.

"So, when the whole Gate thing is over....... kill me......."

After the gate incident, Ellen, with her self gone, is going to try to kill the Devil.

"Before I, Reinhardt, tried to kill you......."

So, let them die when they've served their purpose.

Ellen turned to Tana and Bertus.



* * *



"What is this."

"......."

-Currrrrrr!

An alchemical drug concocted by Lucinil from a recipe given to him by Herriot.

After eating it, Riana summoned three tornadoes to the beach in quick succession.

I don't know if this is correct or not, but it seemed like the only way to really bring out the power.

Of course.

"......."

It was very distressing to see Riana dead with a pale complexion.

"......Let's only use it when we really need it."

"I guess so......."

Riana nodded slowly in agreement with Lucinil's words.

It was a dangerous drug that was too sure to work.

I won't be able to trigger her abilities by grinding her to a pulp.

What to say.

Riana's struggle was almost painful to watch.

In a way, it looks like they're being punished.

In any case, the bottom line is clear.

After taking a depressant, Riana is invincible.



* * *



Riana's medication had a definite effect.

I don't know if you can call this a drug.

Not a pill to make you feel better, but a pill to make you depressed.

Can a drug be called a drug if it has the opposite effect?

In fact, I'd argue that it's what makes the drug worthy of its name.

They say it won't have any side effects, but I don't think you can use it very often because it's almost like it's a side effect.

The more you use it, the sicker it makes you.

That's probably why Herriot said not to wear it.

Riana focused on Herriot's words, not that she shouldn't wear it, but that it would have no side effects other than the potency itself.

Even when I wasn't looking, Riana was practicing with Lucinil on a deserted island, as if trying to get to the bottom of her abilities.

It's nice to have accelerated ability progression, but is it really a good thing?

Riana was abusing herself.

Olivia and the Lord Vampires were well on their way to selecting their elite and preparing for war.

From the moment we step forward, the army's march will accelerate, and the gate will be closed faster and faster.

And aside from preparing for war, other things were happening, one by one.

I was also fighting with Ellen in my dreams every other day.

Still, it didn't work.

If I'm not in the right frame of mind to hurt Ellen, I'm at a disadvantage.

The Voidblade Ramen will cut through everything it touches, except for holy objects.

Even if I became a masterclass, I was still lacking in overall specs, and I wasn't prepared for the fight.

I had to suffer a defeat that would end in one hundred and one, my death.

The pain I felt in my dreams in the moments leading up to my death was a bonus.

"This is already done?"

"Yeah. That wasn't that hard."

I stared open-mouthed at the milky white obelisk that replaced the fountain in Razak's main square.

People coming and going were looking at the suddenly erected obelisk and scratching their heads as if they wanted to know what it was, but they didn't really know what it was.

By my side were Harriet and Airi.

"The scribe's abilities are truly, truly amazing."

"Well, is that......."

Unaccustomed to compliments, Herriot scratched his cheek at Airi's words.

Obelisk of Dreams.

Herriot not only succeeds in interpreting the magic of his dreams, but also quickly succeeds in artifactualizing them.

I feel like I've been scribbling research notes for days, and now I'm trying to make this.

"We'll pilot it for now, and if it works well, we'll roll it out to other regions."

"Good."

I don't know how much a good night's sleep can mean at this time of year, but as someone who has had some pretty ferocious dreams, I'm sure it's something that will help people.



* * *



Interfering with dreams is not technically magic, but rather an ability unique to succubi.

Herriot's ability to turn them into artifacts was already beyond the capabilities of most archmages.

Herriot's capabilities are nowhere near what they were as a freshman.

You've gone from being one of the most talented geniuses in the history of magic, to being fully capable of it.

Oddly enough, it was Charlotte who helped Herriot develop the artifact so quickly.

In the past, when I've had to act as her assistant, she hasn't been able to take time for herself.

But Charlotte is doing a great job of doing what needs to be done without being an assistant, so Harriet can spend all her time doing what she wants to do.

But this.

This feels a little weird.

In the end, it's a good thing that Herriot is able to focus all of his time on his research.

It's nice that Charlotte has taken over everything I've been doing and is doing it better than I ever could.

But it was a little too objective to realize that I was being an idiot and taking up her time.

It's kind of like.

I have to admit, I'm feeling a little self-conscious.

"......."

"What's wrong?"

That night, as we sat in bed getting ready for bed, she looked at me and shook her head when I didn't say anything.

"......what?"

"Are you angry?"

"No, not at all."

"...... doesn't look happy."

I don't feel like I've offended you, and there's no reason to be upset. Technically, I wish it hadn't been implemented so quickly, but there's no reason to feel bad about it.

At my denial, Harriet glares at me.

Come to think of it.

I've spent the most time with Harriet since we took over Edina's government.

So, because he's spent so much time with me, he's the most sensitive to my mood swings.

Literally, I can fool anyone else, but I can't fool Herriot.

In the end, I couldn't help but sigh at the gaze.

"No, I'm just wondering if I've been taking up too much of your time."

"My time......?"

"Yeah, this is what you get for just this much focus, and if I could have run the country on my own, you could have done something else. Something more constructive and progressive. ....... What can I say, you could have done something that only you can do......."

Herriot was too good to be my assistant.

But everyone else around me was busy doing their own thing. I reluctantly let Harriet serve as my assistant, but she was an irreplaceable asset.

If Harriet hadn't been my assistant and had been working on her research, she could have been doing something greater, something that only she could do.

I wish I was a little better at it.

Now that Charlotte, whose qualities were clearly superior to my own, had taken the reigns, I could not help but think of what I could have accomplished in the time that had already passed.

"What the....... was that?"

"I know it's a dumb question, but what can I do about it?"

I sighed, and Harriet smiled wryly.

"Well....... Hmm......."

Harriet squats on her bed, contemplating.

"What I could have done if I had been doing something else....... I honestly don't know, because I was busy, just like you were busy."

"......."

"Still, I liked it."

Harriet looks at me as she says that.

"It was nice to be close to you."

"......Yes."

It leaves me speechless.

I couldn't bring myself to look at Herriot's face.

"Just because I could have done something else doesn't mean that the work we did together is gone, and just because Charlotte can do what we did faster and better doesn't mean that the work we've somehow done is worthless."

"......Yes."

Yes, you're right.

Age seems to have become irrelevant at some point.

At some point, I realize that I'm relying too much on the people around me, and in some ways, they're wiser than I am.

Not to mention being nice to listen to.

It may not mean anything to you, but that's what people need.

Herriot was, and still is, the closest thing to me.

Herriot said he's glad he did.

Aside from the practical efficiency and other possibilities.

I'll admit, I liked it.

From that point on, Herriot was dedicated to me.

I mean, they were trying to give me everything.

When she finished, she went back to writing in her journal.

Now that she doesn't have to act as my assistant, she's still busy.

I keep trying to find something to do.

"But why don't you take it easy? Do you have any more work to do?"

"I guess we'll have to wait and see about the obelisk, but not much else."

"Anything else?"

"I'm learning about the art of betrothal, Lord of Demand."

Engagement.

You're suddenly learning the art of seduction from Lucinil in the middle of all this? At my question, Harriet looked at me and smiled sadly.

"Ellen, you're going to have to get it back somehow."

"ah......."

I felt my breath catch in my throat.

"This is what we had to do because we ran out of time. There might have been another way."

"......."

"I don't want to forget that Ellen took on everything."

Harriet writes in her research journal.

"Ellen is also my friend."

It was Herriot, not Antony, who suggested that Ellen shoulder the burden.

Ellen is also a friend of Harriet's.

I had forgotten the obvious for far too long.

She's been writing in her journal for a while and suddenly looks back at me.

"So don't try to thank me."

"Uh......?"

"Well, that makes me feel bad."

To Herriot's question, I had no answer.
