            Episode 573.





Ludwig headed to the 17th District Guard the next day.

While Heinrich or Ellen could voluntarily patrol the outer reaches of the ecliptic, Ludwig could not and would not be allowed to do so.

They feel deprived or something like that, but they don't know the difference between absolute capabilities.

I didn't dare cross what Ellen and Heinrich could do.

Ludwig makes his way to the guard.

It's hard and it's painful, but do what little you can in the midst of it.

Something as simple as returning a lost child to the hands of its parents is certainly not without meaning.

Hoping that would be the case, Ludwig turned to the guard.

"Ludwig, I have an important mission for you."

"......Important mission?"

"It's a job worthy of Ludwig."

Do what's right for you.

Both the gunner, Sontaine, and the captain of the guard respect Ludwig.

But apart from that, I knew Ludwig couldn't handle the horrors of the camp and the brutality of the guards.

A job befitting such a Ludwig.

"Escort."

Looking at Ludwig, the captain of the guard, Nazik, says.

"Escort......?"

"You know about the pandemic, don't you?"

"Yeah....... I saw it yesterday."

"A priest has been sent to do the cleansing."

Pandemics.

And purification.

Ludwig's eyes widened.

"I'd like an escort from the priest we've sent."

Fighting the pandemic.

What you need to do to save people.

"......Thank you for your consideration."

I know what Ludwig struggles with and what he wants, so I give him this job.



* * *



Priests of Tuan are needed to cleanse the plague.

But Tuan and the Order of Als were being persecuted by the Devil.

Under these circumstances, it was impossible for the priests of Tuan to move in public, even if they were there to cure the plague.

Not only are Tuan's followers persecuted, but the priests suffer even worse.

But the plague cannot be left alone. If the plague spreads beyond the refugee camps and into the ecliptic, it may be beyond the reach of divine power.

That's why Tuan's priests must risk their lives to enter the refugee zone to cleanse it of the plague.

Of course, you can't wear a priest's robe, so you'll have to be stealthy.

You can't be escorted by a large group, or you'll draw attention to yourself, so you have to be stealthy.

Even though you're not doing anything bad, you're trying to save people.

"Priest, this is Ludwig, who will be your escort today."

Ludwig bowed his head as he saw the priest in his graying robes.

"Nice to meet you, I'm Rowen."

"Hello."

The priest, who looked to be about Ludwig's age, looked at him and smiled.

"I don't think you'll make it, but I'll do my best."

Ludwig added, in case anyone was offended by the fact that the only escort the 17th Guard gave him was a one-armed man.

"Yes, please, then."

But the priest smiled gently and nodded, as if he hadn't thought of that at all.



* * *



Ludwig left the 17th District Guard headquarters with Rowen.

Cleaning up the plague. Ludwig's head seemed to clear for the first time in a long time.

It's a simple thing that doesn't require judgment about what's right.

They weren't even dressed in Guard garb to be stealthy, and Rowen had a tattered robe covering his face.

You can't tell that he's a priest or that he's a guard.

If you're doing cleanup work in a plague-ridden area, that's it.

But if it came to it, we might have to use force. Rowen looked at Ludwig walking beside him and shook his head.

"I take it you're not a member of the official guard?"

"What? Oh....... How did you know?"

"As the Captain of the Guard salutes......."

It wasn't even a great line of reasoning.

"Oh....... Actually, I just got back from the Allied garrison, so......."

"You're a participant."

"Yes....... An injury put me in the back of the line, but......."

"You're a great guy, I admire you."

Ludwig felt his face heat up at Rowen's words.

Not because I was ashamed or embarrassed, but because of shame.

Ludwig was only ashamed because he didn't think he deserved it in the slightest.

It's people like Rowen who deserve to be called great.

Priests trying to save people, even though so many people would hate and hate the priests of Tuan.

It's people like that who are great and awesome.

I've been kicked out because I failed, Ludwig thinks, and I don't deserve to be told that.

"We're going to be stealthy, so there won't be any arguments or fuss, and Ludwig, you'll only have to step in if, and only if, you need to."

As if he hadn't done a cleanup job or two before, Rowen told Ludwig what he needed to watch out for.

"Mr. Ludwig, are you good at running?"

"What? Ah....... Yes, I'm sure."

Run.

It's one of the few things Ludwig is confident about doing.

"What about running with people?"

You don't have to tell me who you're running with.

"I'm confident I can do that too."

"If there's a problem, pick me up and run."

Rowen said with a smirk.

If they get into an argument with a refugee, they don't kill them, they leave.

"Yes, I will definitely do that."

Ludwig liked Lowen's approach.

Today, Ellen joined Heinrich on his ecliptic patrol.

Based on what we talked about yesterday, I don't think we should have to go out, but we were both so sore that we couldn't stand it, so we both left after breakfast.

So I had nothing to do but laze around in bed for a while. Gathering information from inside the temple is also blocked for now.

I wonder how long he's been lying like that.

-TalkTalk

As I sat up in bed, I turned my head, and there was a sparrow.

Cats and sparrows.

-TalkTalk

-Tweet!

The sparrow looks at me and shakes his head.

-TalkTalk

-Second!

It's been a while since I've seen that.

Sarkegaroguman.



* * *



Outside the Royal Class dormitory.

Sarkegaard and I chatted, pretending to be returning students.

Honestly, I don't even need to disguise it.

The interior of the temple is almost unrecognizable. It's not completely devoid of people, but it's very rare. The only people you see are the guards.

Our paktong found Sarkegar and sent him here.

We also heard the results of the Senate's meeting.

That it's rather odd that alchemy is irrelevant.

It's not as simple as making undead as we do.

Alchemy is a magical system that is part chemistry, part biology, and part science.

Dealing with corpses is technically dealing with life, so it's no surprise that alchemists are involved.

As an added bonus, the list of Antony's works made me even more dizzy than I already was.

Empires don't do research or experimentation.

You're working on something with a tangible outcome. It's an exhibition, and you don't have the resources to invest in pure academia.

"......Yes, and there were no Mullern's ashes."

More importantly, the Empire might know how to bring a mage back to life as a Reach.

A leech is essentially a living mage undeadizing themselves. It's what a mage does to his or her own body during life. In that case, the Death Knight retains a sense of self, Olivia said.

What we did this time, however, was to bring a dead warrior, or technically a paladin, back to life as a Death Knight.

What if you raise a dead mage as an undead?

It's a lot of choice, and it's going to be a lot of power.

And in war, the role of the wizard is crucial.

Wizards in large-scale attacks, saturation, and support roles definitely have a role to play on the battlefield.

"Sire, the Senate has said that we may have to use force to prevent the Empire from acquiring that level of power."

"......Yes."

"I think so, too."

I know what you're worried about.

The Hall of Heroes also contained the remains of a mage. But it was mostly warriors who were there.

But the Imperial Mausoleum also contains the graves of wizards who have done great magical work. And I'm sure there are many more.

Raise the remains of the greatest archmages in the history of mankind as relics and raise them as an army?

If so, it's like having a large army of mages that far exceeds the Imperial Mages.

Warriors and wizards who have left their mark on human history.

All of them are resurrected and become an army to save humanity.

The situation itself is very plausible, but it's what happens when the knife is pointed at us that's the problem.

Just because Bertus isn't willing to fight us doesn't mean there won't be a war.

Because wars are fought in good faith.

While the addition of Master Class power is scary, the real problem is the addition of Archmage power.

Titans can't cross oceans, but with the right amount of Archmages, an army of that size could storm Edina.

They don't know the status of Edina, but if she is located, it could really happen.

No.

It's not the army that's the problem, it's the thousand or so Archmages that are Lord Vampires, and you might be able to drop a Titan on Edina.

I didn't want to gate, but I ended up gating.

Bertus doesn't want war, and I don't want it either, but for some reason it might happen.

I'm pretty sure there's some sort of curse that keeps putting me in situations I wish wouldn't happen.

Whether it's fate or a prankster's trick0.

If you leave Imperial research alone, the Gate debacle could end more harmlessly.

But if it destroys the world I've worked so hard to build.

I'm not sure it's my destiny to lose everything like that.

However, if the Empire destroys all the projects you're working on because you're doing research that's too risky, isn't that a bad idea?

I'd rather have a war over this than destroy a key project of my empire.

If I attack the Empire now, war will surely ensue. If anything, my decision may prevent the Allies from advancing any further.

If I leave the empire alone now, the gate will be easier to close, but I could lose everything.

Bertus and I both know that we have no animosity toward each other, we just haven't talked about it.

If things change later, it will be because of other people, not because of Bertus' will.

Or maybe Bertus, who doesn't want war, is killed and the new emperor wants to go to war with the devil.

Everywhere I look, I see a future where I'm at war with the Empire.

If you attack, it becomes a rationale for what you're doing now.

When you are silent, the demands of the world become your cause.

If it's a war you're going to fight anyway, you might as well do it against a weakened empire.

But a stronger empire could prevent the unexpected death of someone like this one.

Maybe Delphine doesn't have to die and Ludwig doesn't have to lose his arm.

What about the countless Allied soldiers I don't know.

If we leave the Empire alone, hundreds of thousands of people might survive, and if the Gate crisis ends soon enough, we can use that money to help the refugees.

But Edina.

My people.

I am also responsible for a country.

The empire has more people, so my country can go away and you can live.

You don't get to make that choice.

I felt like I was at a crossroads.

The choices you make today can make a big difference in your future.

I know this one.

Whatever I choose, I'm sure I'll regret it greatly.

It will be another long day of nightmares.

The issue raised by the Senate is not a tilt this time.

Reanimated warriors and reanimated wizards.

The possibility that we might be able to bring the wizard back to life as a reach.

It all starts with that.

But if this can help end the gate crisis, I must also consider the option of leaving it alone.

On the contrary, if that army helps break the final gate, you may be forced to use Alsbringer against the Otherworldly Dragons because you have destroyed the Empire's new power.

Then I would be effectively committing suicide by stopping this project for the empire.

"And then there's the most important issue."

"Most important issue?"

"It is possible that the Empire has joined forces with the Black Order."

"......."

Sarkegar's words stunned me into silence.

Black Order.

Yeah, if it's a sobriquet involving alchemy and the undead, they're probably involved.

Whatever the Empire is doing, the source of the knowledge could be the Black Order.

The power of the Black Order itself may have waned, but the knowledge remains, and it's not impossible that they've found a group that will find that knowledge more valuable than themselves.

But.

The Black Order tried to kill me.

I thought I had to die because my death was necessary for humanity.

So there's a chance that they still want me dead.

If the forces and empires that are hostile to me have joined forces, I need to see what's going on with my own eyes as soon as possible.

It can go either way.

You can either risk meeting Bertus in person and get the whole story, or send Sarkegar to gather information.

Meeting and talking to Bertus is a very dangerous thing. It's dangerous for me, and it's dangerous for Bertus.

But Sarkegar is not a one-size-fits-all.

And the projects the Empire is working on right now are likely to be places that even Sarkhegar would find difficult to enter.

"I need to see the emperor, in person."

I finally decided that I had to meet Bertus in person.

"Your Majesty, it's dangerous."

Naturally, Sarkegaard was concerned.

"It may become dangerous at some point, but that's not now."

Just as Bertus wouldn't attack me if he knew my whereabouts right now, he wouldn't attack me if he saw me.

You can have a conversation. I don't know about later, but we can definitely have a conversation.
