            Episode 665.





The Titan has fallen.

And with a single breath, part of Diane was erased.

I know.

It does not allow attacks with non-holy weapons.

In the original, only Ellen and Ludwig could fight. Everyone else had to leave the dragon to them to slay the monsters.

Others can't even attack it in the first place.

Ellen did not have a sun cloak then, and Rament was not a Voidblade.

In the end, there was no one to beat.

Ludwig uses Alsbringer to summon an incarnation, which is then destroyed along with the dragon.

I had a thought.

Things are very different from the original. Therefore, new things can happen because things are different.

Ellen's ramen has changed, and she now has a sun cloak, which is not present in the original.

So I thought it might be possible to tackle the Void Dragon in a different way than the original.

I thought I might be able to get past this last situation without using Alsbringer.

But it was a ridiculous idea.

The moment I saw part of the army wiped out with a single breath, all other possibilities were put out of my head.

You can fight it.

Surely, I or Ellen could fight that.

But even if you can kill it without using Alsbringer, there will be nothing left after that.

-Goooooooo!

It's overwhelmingly violent.

Otherworldly dragons.

This will be the last absurdity I have to face.

Being subjected to an absurdity of my own making.

What I pay for.

The work was already done.

To use Alsbringer on the spot to kill that last monster.

From the moment Alsbringer was placed in my hands, it was my destiny.

There are a few questions running through my head, but it's not time to dwell on them.

If it needs to be done, it needs to be done.

Because that's how it's always been.

It's just that what you need to do now is the last thing you need to do.

Everything I had done to survive, to not want to die, was eventually lost.

As the violence I had written about became a reality, I lost all other thoughts.

But there's still an army of Immortals chasing me from behind.

All warp gates are gone.

There are still a ton of monsters that have already been vomited out, but there are no more monsters.

We only need to deal with that dragon.

I look back.

An army of Immortals following me, heavy losses but still powerful and intent on killing me.

It's a pain in the rear.

I don't mind if that one follows, but I need to finish that one.

Immortals are not going to help you fight that.

The remaining monsters can only be dealt with by the Alliance.

Then the immortal is now just a threat.

So.

No more running around.

No one should have to risk their lives dealing with immortals.

"Now......."

From your arms, take something.

-Dalcock

Scary to press buttons on artifacts.

-pot!

Two people appear in front of me.

"I don't think we need immortals."

And in a pinch.

The Immortals that have been following me around slaughtering monsters.

-Crispy!

It turns to dust and disappears.

Neutralization wavelength.

Immortals crumble, as if they've hit an intangible wall.

Two people showed up on my cue.

"Does that mean we're done with all the immortals?"

"Please."

One is Scarlett.

"Let's go, Lint."

The other is Conor Lindt.

These two were waiting for my signal.

Scarlett was holding her breath for the most important moment.

Then Kono Lint brought Scarlett here from her imprisonment, and she's been watching the situation, waiting for me to give her the signal.

It was obvious that Immortal was going to attack me, so I was waiting for this moment.

I just ran away until the moment when the immortal could disappear.

Somewhere on the battlefield, my people are also fighting Immortals.

That's it.

From the moment I give the signal, Kono Lint will move across the battlefield with Scarlett in tow, neutralizing all Immortals.

Scarlett can turn Immortals to dust with just a little bit of force, and Kono Lint can move them quickly across the battlefield.

As long as Scarlet was there, Immortal couldn't kill me.

Of course, there were plenty of close calls.

We need to get rid of everything before the immortal does anything weird here.

"Hey....... Is there a way to do that....... to do that, right?"

Kono Rint mumbles to himself as he watches with uneasy eyes the massive dark shape in the distance.

"I can do that."

Okay, that's not a lie.

"We don't have time for a long story."

Scarlett says, with a stern, but determined look on her face.

"Stay alive."

I'm not asking you to save humanity.

I'm not asking you to save everyone.

The words to stay alive.

I find that harder than saving everyone.

Well, I couldn't really say that.

Erase all other thoughts.

What a ridiculous idea it was to not use Alsbringer.

You can fight that, but what's the point if you get caught up in the fight and everyone dies.

If I dodge its attacks, that's how many people die.

The dragon's roar is getting louder, and its fuselage is getting closer.

Braving the rain to reach the point where an otherworldly dragon is rampaging.

I could see someone running in the opposite direction of me.

It was Ellen.

-curl!

Ellen got there before me.

Ellen, cloaked in the cloak of the sun, leaps high, the veil of night stretched long.

Swing the Voidblade at the dragon's head.

And.

-Scourer!

The dragon's head has been cut off.

Hilariously, effortlessly.

Next moment.

It disappeared with a bang.

"What......?"

Now.

What did I see?



* * *



Some people may have no idea what happened because of the heavy rain.

Those too far away may not even realize that an otherworldly dragon has appeared.

But those watching from afar must have exclaimed in delighted disbelief as the dragon that had crippled the Titan with a single blow was sliced and diced.

The final boss has arrived.

Then he was sliced up by Ellen and disappeared.

But you could bring anyone in the world and no one would be more surprised than me.

That's not a monster that dies like that.

In vain like this.

It's not a monster that disappears into thin air.

It wasn't even a fight.

Ellen merely swung her Voidblade as she would any other monster.

A Voidblade that slashes through anything.

If the power of an Otherworldly Dragon and a Ramen is essentially the same, then an Otherworldly Dragon can be slain.

I'm the only one who realizes how ridiculous this is.

I tried to use Alsbringer.

However, Ellen made it look so effortless that I was able to defeat the enemy I had spent so much time trying to defeat.

Whatever it was, it didn't use Alsbringer.

Ever since Ellen's ramen took on the form of the Void, that last monster was destined to fade into nothingness like this.

However, I wasn't sure if the Voidblade would work with it.

I knew that the Voidblade would cut "anything", but not holy items.

However, otherworldly dragons were not among the exceptions to the Voidblade.

I should be happy.

Yes.

You should be happy.

I know it's not.

The dragon is gone.

The Gate debacle is over, we just need to clean up the remaining monsters around here.

Immortals can be handled by Scarlet.

But.

All that's left for me is to get started.

That's why I can't rejoice.

-Tat!

After almost flying through the air, Ellen lands lightly on the ground.

-shootaaaaa

At the spot where the otherworldly dragon had appeared, which had become a giant clearing, Ellen was looking exactly in my direction, drenched in rainwater.

"......."

Maybe a hundred meters.

The distance is not very far.

The otherworldly dragon disappeared far too easily.

I have to deal with something in this position anyway.

It just went from being an otherworldly dragon to something else.

You have to deal with a warrior.

Somehow.

The moment I saw the otherworldly dragon, I knew I had to use Alsbringer.

Then, I actually tried to write it.

But then what happens to the future I see.

That future where I die, and Ellen dies.

That was.

I thought, for a moment.

This is what happened.

The idea of using Alsbringer to hunt otherworldly dragons was never meant to be.

Ellen looks at me in the rain.

No, that's not Ellen.

A collection of spirits that have taken over Ellen's body.

An assemblage of certain demons, perhaps even more enlarged and massive than before.

It definitely has a will.

The first time I encountered it, I definitely had a conversation with it.

I wonder if I can win.

I fought so many times in my dreams.

I've died countless times.

But will I be able to win this battle that has become a reality?

It was supposed to happen.

If I am the son of a demon, and Ellen is the sister of a warrior.

It was bound to happen at some point.

I knew this moment would come, and I knew it from the moment I got close to Ellen.

I didn't hesitate to get close to Ellen, even though I knew I would one day.

It's a trade-off.

If you turned away Ellen from the beginning.

If you're unaided, unsupported, and distanced from nothing, maybe.

This would not have happened.

I got close, even though I knew I would regret it.

I wanted to avoid this moment at all costs, but I knew it was coming.

That there would come a moment when he would have to fight for his life with Ellen, one way or another.

This is the expected sequence.

I got over the last hurdle easily.

With that, no more people will be sacrificed to otherworldly dragons.

Instead, the trial falls on me alone.

A harsh trial for only me.

You need to beat Ellen.

No, it's not enough to win.

Recover Ellen without killing her.

Somehow, I need to stop Ellen from killing me, subdue her, and even get her back.

Fighting a fight you know you're not going to win, when you know you're not even going to kill.

That should do it.

I do know one thing, though.

If the future I see is correct.

If I lose, I'm not the only one who dies.

Ellen, who killed me, takes her own life.

Against an otherworldly dragon, I would give my life to kill it, but this time I can't even kill it.

You can't fight with the intent to kill.

If you do, you die, and so does Ellen.

The gate debacle is over, and the last monster is dead.

However, I can't think of a worse day than today.

A torrential downpour runs down its face and into its eyes.

He has no expression, and looks like he's crying his eyes out.

No, someone who is actually crying.

'It' stands still and points a sword at me.

"Devil......."

A voice that sounds like multiple voices overlapping.

It was a bizarre sound that seemed to tear at my eardrums, not my soul.

Just hearing the voice was like reliving the pain and terror I felt as it consumed my body.

I wonder how long Ellen put up with that.

The sum total of hatred for me.

The culmination of all the anger and sadness of those who had to lose so much, so innocently.

Apparently, it once said it would take me and everything I love.

'It' says.

"Now, let's see the end."

It walks slowly toward me, with a short, blunt opening statement.

Deepest Diane, where everything has evaporated, and it's just Ellen and me.

The battlefield binges and monster screams are far away.

-shootaaaaa

-challenge.

That's why I could hear myself stepping in puddles in the rain.

It's a giant pit, and no one is watching.

-Charles

-Rumble

I'm neither desperate nor impatient.

A calm step that definitely closes the distance.

The vibe is different.

When Ellen arrived at the master class, she was not only clad in blue Auror armor, but also in an unidentifiable off-white smoke.

That's a lot of spirits at work.

Their true purpose is to kill me, not to end the gate crisis.

Therefore, it will be the most powerful.

They're going to do everything they can to kill me.

-goooooooo

A strange, unintelligible rumble and tingling emanate from Ellen's body.

Warriors.

Perhaps, right now, Ellen is the strongest person on the planet.

Such a being wears the sharpest sword in the world and the hardest armor in the world.

The vessel, named Warrior, holds the wrath of all those who died because of the demon.

It's strange that the last enemy a demon must face to rule the world is not the one right in front of him.

Despite all the odds, I'm not one of those otherworldly dragons that Ellen slayed with a single blow.

I've previously confirmed that Voidblades can't ring relics.

-Bam!

With a light sound of spurting water, Ellen comes to my periphery, lightly swinging her Voidblade.

The light, calm, yet sharp leap, and the arcing trajectory of the Void Sword as it approached, seemed at first glance to be beautiful.

Obviously, a Voidblade can't break an artifact.

-Bam!

"Turn off...... Yuck!"

However, not being beige was by no means unbearable.

Unity of the Voidblade.

I blocked it.

I broke my wrist.
