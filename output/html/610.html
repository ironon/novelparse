Just a few days.

So much has happened in just a few days.

Sudden riots.

Sudden slaughter.

"The empire's days are numbered."

Louise said as she sat on the terrace with Heinrich.

"What do you mean you're out of luck......?"

"Do you think a country can survive if its people are turned away from it?"

"The empire is strong, so why not?"

"We'll survive. Until the cause loses its meaning."

Louise stared at the thickening snow.

"What are you talking about?"

At Heinrich's question, Louise nodded.

"Right now, you, too, are thinking that this behavior of the Empire is inevitable."

Heinrich's eyes widened at Louise's words.

If the empire collapses now, it's all over.

That's why I thought that if this action of the empire, this uprising of the refugees, led to the overthrow of the empire, the entire human race might be destroyed.

So it's brutal and horrible, but.

I thought it was inevitable.

"That is the rationale. To make an action compelling, whether it's war, raising the dead, or genocide."

Gate event.

"Right now, the Empire has an absolute and perfect excuse for the Gate Crisis. So the Empire will do whatever it takes to survive."

"Even the atrocity of raising the corpses of the dead and turning them into an army was justified by the need to end the Gate crisis. No matter how cruel, no matter how brutal, one absolute reason rationalizes everything."

"This is also true."

"This uprising was sparked by people's legitimate anxiety and fear, and the Empire was able to put a knife to people's throats because they now have the excuse of stopping the Gate."

"What would it have been like under normal circumstances?"

"Creating an army from the corpses of fallen soldiers? It would have been a continent-wide publicity stunt. The Empire would have been torn apart in an instant. Even I, in peacetime, would not have been able to accept that an imperial family that did such a thing belonged to the continent. Not that I wouldn't have accepted it, but I would have used it as an opportunity to bring the empire down."

"Rioting and slaughtering? We could have done that, but we would have had to pay the price."

"The empire is staking too much on the absolutes of the gate crisis."

"You're saving all the payoffs for later."

"You're going to have to pay for this one day."

"The day the gate crisis ends, all bets are off."

"The people will still be powerless, but they'll hate the empire."

At Louise's words, Heinrich shook his head in disbelief.

"Just because people hate empires....... Is it possible for an empire to fall?"

"No, it is not the people who bring down empires. Causes are not for the little people."

"If not, then......."

"Cause is for those in power, by those in power."

Causes are meant to be used. That's why they're not for the faint of heart.

"When the gate debacle is over, there will be another rationale."

"What other reason?"

"That empires should die."

Heinrich's eyes widen at that.

"It's a country that uses dead people to build an army, commits countless civilian massacres, and can't even provide for its own people."

"And now people are hating and hating the empire."

"It means that in the future, we will want someone else to take the seat of the imperial family of Gradias."

"No matter who sits in that seat, people won't miss the empire. They've already built up too much hatred and resentment."

People's hatred and anger toward the empire becomes a rationale.

But crowds can't bring down empires.

Someone with power, someone with authority.

When he takes over an empire on that basis, the people will support the new empire that replaced it.

A rationale is a reason, a rationale.

Evidence that suggests that when a new power emerges, people don't rebel against it.

As long as the empire is hated, people will not rebel against whoever takes its place.

"I've often imagined empires falling......."

Louise stares out at the landscape. It has long been the dream of the Schwarz family to overcome their inferiority complex to the Empire and become masters of it.

But now that the empire was truly crumbling, Louise von Schwarz was not happy about it.

Empires build karma.

At some point, you have to pay the price.

"That's interesting."

Louise exhales.

"If you're hated no matter who you are, is it really okay to let anyone sit in that seat......."

"What do you mean?"

"Let's say people don't like Gradias Huang. They'll already hate it."

"Yes......."

"Wouldn't it matter if a demon sat in that seat?"

"......Yes?"

Louise giggles at Heinrich's dumbfounded reaction.

"On the contrary, they might think that since they haven't seen the Devil, they might be a little better than the Empire, which is already the worst."

The Empire is showing the worst of the worst.

I hate empires and I hate demons.

However, I haven't encountered the devil yet.

So you might imagine that it might be a little different from the Empire, that it's already bad, but it can't be worse.

"He who has everyone's support is the master, or the worst of the worst in an already bad situation. I don't see why not."

If it's the best of both worlds, people will ostracize and reject the worst and want the best.

But if it's the worst of both worlds.

People will want a differential.

Empires are the worst. It is heading for the worst.

So feel free to sit down.

Feel free to take it away.

If you have the power to do so.

"I think I know why I was able to get into the temple......."

Louise said, and took a sip of her now chilled black tea.

'The emperor is digging his own grave.......'

Dig a grave.

I'm not selling you something you don't know.

Knowingly digging.



* * *



"Yet?"

"Yes. I'll need a little more time, so I'm going to send you an email to......."

Elayon Bolton grew impatient at the sight of so many priests wrestling with paperwork at the Crusader headquarters.

Every available priest in the Crusader Order had been assigned to decipher the cipher, but the work had been going on for far too long with little progress.

Elion Bolton watched the bustle, and, unable to bear it, went out onto the terrace.

Outside the high temple of the Crusaders, it was still snowing.

Excessive snowfall had already become a major problem for refugee camps.

It's snowing, so much snow.

But that was one thing, but what was happening between people was more problematic.

Conditions in the refugee camps were already extreme, and so was the Empire's response.

Of course, he knew intuitively that this situation had nothing to do with Rowen.

I realize this is just the beginning.

The empire would rather cut its own flesh than let itself collapse.

There's no guarantee that the next thing to be cut is necessarily flesh. It might be bone, or it might be something else that needs to be sacrificed.

We need to find Rowen.

Rowen's control over the pagans scattered throughout the refugee camps means that the camps are effectively Rowen's.

When desperation and hopelessness get the better of them, evil and hatred can be the only thing left.

The riots have subsided in violence, but the next one will be even bigger.

"What difference does it make if I find it?

What happened can't be what didn't happen.

Just as the Gate debacle cannot be undone, neither can the riots in the refugee camps and the massacres of the empire.

Even if you find Rowen and eliminate the cultists, the chaos has already begun.

Finding the arsonist is one thing, but stopping a fire that's already out of control is another.

The arsonist and the fire are now two completely separate things.

You may be able to find Rowen and stop him from starting fires elsewhere, but the fire that has already grown will take care of itself.

The good news is that the person you need most right now, the Devil, has approached.

The Popes' arbitrary sacrifice of the Crusader Knights and the Five Great Houses is a gnashing of teeth and a rotting of guts, but what we need now is a demon.

Rowen is a follower of the Devil.

If so, you'll absolutely follow the devil's lead.

A word from the devil.

If we can get the word out to Rowen to stop his self-destructive behavior, we can stem the tide of madness somewhat.

But to do that, we need to find Rowen eventually.

You can't make a big deal out of announcing that a demon has appeared on the ecliptic to find Rowen.

That's like starting a landslide to put out a fire.

Secretly.

By implication.

If you can reach Rowen and let him know that the Crusaders and the High Priestesses have already sided with the Demon, you can control this chaos.

They tried to purge Rowen.

Elion Bolton's eyes glazed over as he realized the ramifications of his choice.

We don't know what the Empire is up to, but it's clear that it's doing something quite dangerous and sinister.

If the empire-hating Rowen were to learn of it, he felt that bad things were bound to happen, one way or another.

But in the end, Elion Bolton was caught in a self-fulfilling prophecy: to stop something dangerous, he invited something even more dangerous.

The Demon is waiting for information from the Crusaders, and he's probably scrambling to find Rowen himself.

But in the end, the important information is inside the Crusaders themselves.

Deciphering the coded documents will reveal the power of the cultists, and perhaps lead to Rowen's whereabouts.

But that task.

Grewen had accumulated so much material over the years that he was not able to analyze it properly.

It's been a few days already.

But hey, we've already been through this once, so there's time before the next one.

Even if the coded documents were decrypted and the information extracted, Rowen would still know what he had left behind.

So I could think of any number of ways to make this information worthless.

Just one word.

The devil you worship and follow so much has already come to us.

All I need to do is say that word and everything will be fine, but I can't do that.

The Devil's Approach.

The only ones who know are the Crusader Knights and the Popes of the Five Great Houses.

Just as the Gate debacle ultimately came down to misunderstandings and lies, so too is Rowen trying to set the ecliptic on fire without realizing that what he so desperately wants has already been accomplished.

Elayon Bolton watches as numerous priests shuffle through papers.

I should have spared a few of the Inquisitors.

If we had, it wouldn't have taken this long.

But there's no point in hindsight.

If only the Crusader Knights weren't so wary of having too much power that they deliberately don't tell you what you need to know.

If we had, this wouldn't have happened.

Popes and Elion Bolton's hypervigilance ruined everything.

Elion Bolton flips through the coded documents.

Having never served as an inquisitor, Elion Bolton could not and did not need to read these coded documents.

As such, all of the priests in the analytical chamber had either served as inquisitors or were doing something related to that.

Technically, Rowen was in charge of all the Inquisitors, so they were his subordinates.

However, most of Rowen's direct reports, who would know the key details of the case, are dead, so progress is slow.

But really.

Is it really?

Elion Bolton sees the priests in the analysis room in a flash of inspiration.

Turn the page, write something down, do something.

To do something.

Elion Bolton watches them go.

You're doing something.

But eye movement.

A hand gesture that flips through a piece of paper.

There's an unknown there.

An odd sense of dissonance.

It looks like it's doing something.

It looks like it wants to do nothing.

That's the kind of awkwardness I feel.

Elion Bolton covers his face with both hands and lets out a deep sigh.

'Holy crap.......'

It was stupid.

It was too stupid.

They could not be more relevant to Rowen.

By the way.

But why on earth.

Did he trust them to follow his orders?

That the Crusaders are a group that does the bidding of their leader.

Why did I take it for granted?

Can you find a needle in a haystack?

That would be hard unless you had a ton of time on your hands. And now, when I wasn't even sure how much time I had, I was feeling in real time what it felt like to have my blood run dry.

The debacle, presumably involving Rowen, was going nowhere.

I debated dozens of times a day whether or not to include a super rainfall to show that the Devil had appeared on the ecliptic.

An accident happens and some flow happens.

You can't stop it.

But I'm not going to find Rowen by screaming at the top of my lungs from the sidewalk, so I'll have to wait for information from the Crusaders.

The same was true on the Bertus side.

Rowen told him what they had been doing and what they could do, but Bertus could do nothing but frame the catastrophe as a massacre.

If things get even more extreme, Bertus might actually choose to wipe out the entire refugee camp.

Hundreds of thousands have already died in one fell swoop.

An empire that has reached the point where it can roll a guard of masterminds can make such a thing happen.

If things get any weirder, tens of thousands, not hundreds of thousands, are slaughtered.

Not death by disaster, not death by starvation, but death by genocide.

I can't let that happen, but there's little I can do about it.

All you can do is get a little more information, a little faster, to get to Rowen.

You need to find the needle in the haystack.

You need to find it quickly.

For a guy who loves the devil so much, the least you can do is tell him to shut up and watch me now that I'm here so this craziness stops.

The Great Hall of Alth is an overly prominent location.

And meeting the popes in person is risky.

That's why we told them to send a contact to the designated contact point.

The location is the sewer under the Bronzegate Bridge.

The location of the Rotary Club.

As I made my way to the rendezvous point, I saw someone who appeared to be my contact standing in the corner of the sewer waiting for me.

A woman in tattered robes smiles at me.

The smile was a little uncanny.

What to say.

overly welcoming.

A smile that doesn't quite fit this moment.

"The Devil."

And overly friendly nicknames.

We don't know what's going on.

"Maybe......."

But then you realize.

Although it's impossible to find a needle in a haystack.

"I think you're Rowen."

The needle came to me, was it possible?
