-▒▒▒▒!

An indescribable roar shakes the earth.

They couldn't even keep their balance on the shaking ground as the meteors fell, and that was true of the monsters with their feet on the ground.

The tornado was very far away, but it had skin-tearing winds.

Shockwaves, earthquakes, and storms from striking meteorites.

Just as the monsters couldn't move properly, I found myself in a similar situation.

The reason Herriot is with me is simple.

This was because any meteors that could directly harm us would be blown elsewhere by the portal Herriot had created in thin air.

And an escape, just in case.

-Grrrrrrrr!

But neither earthquakes, nor windstorms, nor shockwaves could affect the fleshy beasts.

-Bang! Kwalung!

A bolt of lightning from the sky struck the monster with the head of a lion and the body of a snake, but it only flinched a few times.

Herriot cast the exploit and detonated it in the creature's face, but it only flinched slightly.

Monsters that can't be killed by fire, thunderbolts, or magic.

As the situation escalates, there are more and more immune monsters.

-Woof!

The blue auror-wielding Alsbringer impales the giant snake's flesh and rips it apart.

It's not often that a monster is immune to a physical direct hit. Especially if it's an Auror Blade.

That's why melee is always the best way to fight, and a useful way to fight until the fight is over.

Once.

-Crack!

-POOF!

Twice.

-skuck!

Three times.

-knowwhat!

With one sweeping motion, I cut off the snake's waist, and the snake-like creature's fuselage snaps in half, like a tree snapping under the weight of my body.

Rampaging monsters disappear in meteor showers and their explosions, while flying monsters constantly crash to the ground.

Monsters struck by lightning are reduced to ash.

Nevertheless, the overflowing monsters scream and come to kill me and Herriot.

Herriot, who wears a barrier to protect himself from gusts of wind, runs with me.

-Flash!

Shockwaves, explosions, and flames caused by fireworks.

We try to break through the waves of monsters and destroy the warp gate.

I wouldn't call the original world a paradise.

In the original world, disastrous things happened everywhere, all the time.

But even if you can't call it a paradise, a world where you have to watch it all the time and everywhere is hell.

Putting this hell behind us and ending the Gate debacle doesn't mean paradise is here.

The world will never be the same.

Still.

Nevertheless.

I know I can't make paradise, but I'll at least lift you out of this hell.

-Currrrrr!

A giant creature, able to fly through the fierce gusts of wind, emerges and begins spitting flames at Herriot.

"Reinhardt!"

Herriot's barrier shields us from the flames' breath.

The flames were melting the area out of range of the barrier in no time, and they were burning and killing the monsters that were charging at us.

That's about it.

There are worse monsters out there.

And at some point, you have to fight the last monster.

-Currrrrrr!

I and Harriet watched, dumbfounded, as the earth rumbled and roared, as the monsters melted away beyond the breath of flame.

-Quack!

The breath of flame that seemed to scorch the ground beneath me and Herriot for all eternity ceased, and I watched as the creature that had cast a giant shadow over the land was struck by a meteor and fell, missing a wing.

Instead of a warp gate, the meteor hit a much larger monster, and the shockwave from the collision was a bonus.

-캬아아아아악!

-Koooooowwww

A slow falling monster crashes down, crushing hundreds of monsters.

Responding to disaster with disaster.

"It's not long now."

"Yes."

Herriot freezes the melted ground with his freezing spell, and we're off again.

The goal was not far off.

And soon enough, we found our first target.

-Currrr!

The monsters come out.

No, that's not coming out, that's pouring out.

Monsters were pouring out of the glowing warp gate, as if they were pouring in.

The spilled monsters became waves of flesh, rising and falling, most of them crushed to death before they could even stand up.

But out of the ever-flowing waves of monsters, something takes shape and rises, and as soon as it is born, it rushes toward us as if it recognizes an enemy.

Before we even reach the gate, the oozing flesh of the monsters is itself a wall we must breach.

Summon a meteor shower, spark a tornado, or create a lightning storm.

If we don't destroy the cursed warp gate, it won't be long before monstrosities overrun the entire area.

We need to break that.

Only by erasing it from the world can this curse be broken.

It's not going to be paradise.

Hell can be escaped.

Herriot's entire body begins to surge with blue energy.

Soon, the glowing blue power lines and the power cartridges glowing in Herriot's necklace were no longer blue, but white.

Only once.

You just need to clear the way for a moment.

It was just me and Harriet breaking down the gate.

The rest of us are only supposed to provide remote support, and that's the way it is.

Because we are enough.

Against the waves of flesh, Herriot focuses his magic on his fingertips.

It compresses and compresses and compresses horsepower to the limit, concentrating it into a single point and firing it in a single direction.

There's no such thing as a magic name.

An attack based solely on Herriot's understanding and control of mana, a concentrated burst of refined and compressed energy.

Honest disenchantment, that's all.

-Koo-koo-koo-koo-koo!

However, the blast of magic from Herriot's fingertips is a storm of energy in itself.

Even monsters with antimagic powers are consumed by the storm of power.

In an instant, the way opened and the warp gate that had been hit by it remained intact, enveloped in a red barrier.

Are you sure you can survive an energy storm of this magnitude?

I know that reinforced warp gates can't be broken by ranged sniping, but is it even possible with this much power, and if so, does a direct hit from a meteor do any good?

There's no such thing as time to despair.

If the first doesn't work, try the second, and if the second doesn't work, try the third and fourth.

It just tries until it breaks.

There's no such thing as time to waste.

I run instinctively toward the open road.

Run, run, run, toward the warp gate that spits out the monster once again, energizing the Alsbringer to its limits.

Stabbing the Alsbringer into the shields of the Warp Gate.

command.

"Department...... go!"

That's it, one.



* * *



Outskirts of Serandia.

"This is....... What is......?"

Kono Lindt was speechless as he watched the scene unfold before him.

-Kuung

-Flash!

-currrrrr

Three tornadoes of incalculable proportions were swirling around Serandia, hundreds of thunderbolts were killing monsters every second, and meteors were raining down from the sky.

It was such a devastating sight that if anyone saw it, they would say the world had finally come to an end.

High in the air, his body pinned to the ground, Kono Lint watched the disaster of Serandia unfold in real time.

Kono Lint didn't come here on a reconnaissance mission.

You're in this place because you're arbitrary.

No explanation is given by the General Command for the bizarre things that are happening up ahead.

Kono Lint had scouted out some of the first strange situations, but since then, only a few units have been sent on frontline reconnaissance missions.

Some in the Alliance already knew something strange was going on, and Kono Lint was no exception, having seen it with his own eyes.

Something too big and inscrutable to be called an imperial power is helping.

Kono Lint was out scouting on his own, hoping to see what he could find before the Serandia assault.

The sky opens up and a meteor rains down.

Lightning strikes.

-Whoosh!

"Ugh!"

The wind was blowing in gusts that threatened to tear my ears off, even though I was anchored to the ground.

In a storm where he can barely keep his eyes open, Kono Lint tries to take in everything that comes into view.

On the ground, a battle was raging.

A tiny dot against a monster wave.

dots, but somehow they're hanging in there.

They pale in comparison to the Allied forces, but they are clearly fighting.

They're too far away to get a good look, and while they could approach at any time, Kono Lint doesn't dare.

Battles in the city's outskirts.

And downtown Serandia.

-Flash!

Konorint could clearly see one of the warp gates flash and crush.

Kono Lint clearly remembers.

The day the heavens opened.

From that day on, it was as if the world was cursed, and the whole disaster began.

The gate incident is said to have originated from the devil, and Kono Lint knows it.

But why was a spell used by the Devil's minions cast on Serandia, and one of the warp gates blown away?

With the gusts of wind making it hard to keep my eyes open, I couldn't really see who was fighting where.

But it's possible to guess from what's happening.

A meteor falls.

Lightning is summoned.

The magic of the Demon, and the psychic powers of Riana, who disappeared with the Demon.

'Reinhard......?'

Why are the people who allegedly caused the gate crisis so desperate to break it?

"Are you saying that Reinhardt was the one who broke through the Allied lines so far?

Conolint doesn't know what's behind it.

However, if it's a demonic force here.

If they are trying to destroy the warp gate, they could destroy humanity if they unleashed that power on the Alliance.

Is something that should be known not being known?

Is there a truth that people should know but don't?

Something is different.

There's a disconnect between what people think they know and the truth.

The moment Conor Lint had that thought.

"The rat is......."

"!"

Kono Lint squinted as he saw a gray-haired old man appear out of thin air.

"There you go."

"Holy......!

It was faster for the old man to reach out to Lint than for Kono Lint to use spatial travel.



* * *



"Reinhardt, we have to get out of here!

'Just one more, just one more.......'

'It's time, they're all pulling out, we've done enough!'

'Still one....... There's still one....... And at least one.......'

"No!

One large warp gate.

Medium one.

Small two.

You could call it a miraculous major, and it was enough to give the Allies a significant boost.

Thank goodness for Herriot.

Otherwise, I could have gone on a rampage to break one more thing and done something irreversible.

The main body backed me up for the allotted time and returned to Edina, and I was about to make a stand when Harriet scowled at me and retreated.

Yes, I did post a miraculous major.

I tried to do something beyond my capabilities and was forced to retreat by Herriot's urging, and it's a good thing our forces were not harmed.

By the way.

I couldn't help but narrow my eyes at the familiar face hanging limply from the Vampire Clan mage's shoulder.

"......What is it?"

"We have a spy, and we've got him, great one."

Antirrhinus secures a strange piece of loot called a cono lint.



* * *



Antirrhinus seized Conor Lint, who had been watching the situation.

How in the world did he spot and capture this guy in that situation?

At least Kono Lint has seen the scene.

You've probably gotten the idea that it's my faction that's in Serandia.

We don't know what Kono Lindt thought when he saw it.

But Kono Lint saw something he shouldn't have.

We can't send them back to the Allied lines as they are.

One wrong word from this guy and you've got a major disaster on your hands.

So.

"......."

"......."

I was back in Razak, watching Kono Lint, who had just woken up.

When he woke up, he was frozen with his mouth hanging open.

He doesn't say anything, just rolls his eyes.

"Bounce?"

"......!"

You're such an asshole.

Kono Lint is an ability, so he can run away if he wants to.

"It's nice to bounce, but do you know where you are?"

"Uh, that....... Yeah......."

What he doesn't know is that he's in Rajakra in the Edina Archipelago, the southernmost part of the continent.

At this rate, it would take years to spacewalk across the continent until you found an Alliance base.

You may think I'm a long time coming, but I'm not.

So I'm not all that unfamiliar with KonoLint.

This guy, on the other hand, was just rolling his eyes like he didn't know what was what.

"Because if you run away, you'll be lost and found as a skeleton, you know what I mean?"

"Uh....... Yeah."

"I'm not going to be rough with him, and I don't see why I should be. Let's talk, and after a few words, I'll send him on his way to the Allied lines."

Kono Lint could only pay lip service to the situation.
