"I told you to stop picking on her."

"The response is so good, I can't stop, Your Majesty."

Holding the glass of champagne his maid had brought him, the Emperor took a long swig and sighed heavily.

The Emperor was still frozen, smirking at the squirming Kono Lint and his classmates around him.

"It's nice to be cuddly, but I'm afraid he's going to start claiming that something is planted in his ear."

"Planting something in your ear......? What are you talking about......."

"No, there is such a thing."

Every once in a while, the emperor says something that only he knows, and no one else understands what it is.

The captain of the Intelligence Corps, created after the war, is Rowen.

Rowen is the leader because there are more specialized people in the field. Sarkegar and Kono Lindt are more suited to field work.

As such, they are placed based on ability, not merit.

Sarkegaard seemed quite interested in Kono Lint.

I think he often did things that were nothing more than harassment, but it was clear that he cared a lot.

The emperor stares at the banquet hall. Countless people talk about countless things.

The Emperor watches the stories and the gatherings without mingling with them.

-You're too young to be enjoying a drink.

The emperor watches as a middle-aged gentleman approaches a silver-haired girl.

A middle-aged gentleman walks up to a silver-haired girl in a colorful dress and shakes his head.

-HoHo....... What is that blood-red wine? I've never seen such a brilliant color in my life.

-......That's right.

-......Yes?

-p That's right.

She gives her wine glass a quick swirl, and the eerie red color of the glass confirms her words.

After lightly wetting her lips with the liquid, the girl opens her blood-stained lips. Gruesome fangs are revealed.

-Huh, huh......!

-Never seen a vampire before?

-What, is that......, human blood......?

-Why not? Want a drink?

-No, not at all, not at all, it's fine!

-Yes? Well, can I get you a drink? -Bam! I could do that. It'd be kind of nice.

-No, not at all! No, not at all! Shh, excuse me......!

The emperor watched with a smirk as a middle-aged man shrank away from a girl with a seductive smile.

As the man runs away in horror, the dark-haired woman approaches the girl.

-Rucinil! I always tell you not to scare the aman!

-No, you asked me what it was first, so I told you.

The Emperor watches as Eleris and Lucinil argue.

Many demons joined the Empire, but most of the vampires who had been with them since Edina left.

Galarsh and Leruen led their clans out of the Empire.

Tired of the noise, he led his clan back to their own silence.

What's left is Elise, Tuesday's housekeeper, and Lucinil, Wednesday's housekeeper.

And the Toyo clan, left behind by the disappearance of their patriarch, Antrianus.

Elise had taken them in and was taking temporary charge.

So Eleris was not only a Hwaju, she was now also a Toyo, caring for Toyo's clan.

Originally, the Lord Vampire clans were few in number as they did not seek to expand their membership.

But they all played a fairly important role in the early empire.

To ensure their legitimacy, the vampires created a bloodletting organization.

What's funny is that some humans, upon learning of the existence of the Lord Vampire, have reacted to the idea of a vampire that can withstand the sun.

I was often bombarded with people asking me if I wanted to be a vampire.

So, not for the humans, but for the vampires, he created an estate where they could live in peace and strictly forbid outsiders from entering.

Some people knocked on the door, saying they wanted immortality and eternal life.

Because that's always sweet.

While the feast was still going strong.

The Emperor saw Empress Louise approaching.

"Your Majesty."

"Ah....... Yes."

"I have something important to tell you."

"Four?"

Without asking for the Emperor's opinion, Empress Louise grabs him by the arm with a very serious look on her face and starts dragging him somewhere.

And then there was Heinrich von Schwarz, who watched the spectacle with his mouth hanging open.



* * *



The place where the Emperor was taken to Empress Louise was one of the unoccupied rooms somewhere in the Palace of Spring.

The emperor's heart was beating like a madman.

Is it time?

Is this how it ends up?

But why today?

There are other days, but today?

Why?

The Emperor had many things to fear, but now the world fears Louise.

Fear mixed with guilt.

That's why he freezes when he sees her.

"I'm going to go, sir. I'm going to go, sir. I'm going to go, sir. I'm going to go for five minutes....... Five minutes....... Five minutes......."

"......."

“그, 싫어서는! 싫어서는 절대 아닙니다! 그, 괜, 괜찮! 좋습니다! 좋죠! 그, 그래도 자, 잠깐…….”

"...... for real!"

-Bam!

"Ack......!"

In the end, Louise, having had enough of the bullshit, does the unthinkable: she drives a honeycomb into the emperor's skull.

Louise looks down at the Emperor with cold eyes, her eyeballs bulging.

"Have a seat."

"Yes."

At Louise's simple command, the emperor sat up in bed.

Louise's eyes grow even colder at the sight.

"Not there, here."

Louise pointed to a chair, not a bed.

The Emperor, realizing that he had not been prepared for this, staggered to his feet and sat back in his chair.

It's no wonder the emperor's face is so grim.

When the Emperor finally regained his senses, he saw that the Empress was not empty-handed now, but was holding something.

-Dalcock

Empress Louise removes the contents one by one and sets them down.

"Is this....... What is it, a book?"

Inside the case was a book.

No, it's more like a notebook than a book.

A tattered and dirty notebook.

It was laid before the emperor.

"I think you should see this."

The Emperor was puzzled, but did as the Empress said and carefully opened the notebook.



* * *



The soiled notebooks were frayed and tattered at the edges, and many were even torn.

It wasn't a deliberate tear, it was more of an accidental tear.

"This is from the Adventurers' Guild headquarters in Cernstadt."

"......Yes."

The emperor was puzzled at first, flipping through his notebook.

Most of them were illustrated.

"Is ...... a picture of a monster?"

"Yes, I think so."

"......Why do you draw pictures of monsters?"

Monsters have a form of beauty, and who wants to record it?

There are a lot of weirdos out there, so it's not like there won't be any.

Louise didn't answer. As if to say, "Go ahead and watch.

The drawings aren't very detailed, but they do capture the characteristic details.

It's not a very well-drawn picture, but it's not an overly crude one either.

It's a quick, precise drawing that looks like it could have been done in ink.

Each page didn't just have a picture of a monster on it.

And at the bottom of the picture, there's a small print.



[Northeast of Cernstadt, in the hills near the border with Eyreden].



The Emperor looks at the note and shakes his head.

"Found at....... Same thing."

What it tells us.

I saw and drew these monsters, not in my imagination or something else.

It's time for the Adventurer's Guild to pay you to kill monsters.

"You don't have a policy of paying for drawings, not monster corpses, do you?"

"That's not always the case, but it's usually the case."

There are exceptions, but I don't get paid for drawings. So this wasn't a proof drawing for a paycheck.

And most of all, it's too long.

Rather than express his doubts, the emperor decides to take a closer look at the notebook.

I don't know who it belongs to, but I'm careful not to damage the old, tattered, dirty notebook.

I have no doubt that these notebooks are very valuable, regardless of their condition.

The emperor's expression becomes increasingly serious as he turns the page and checks another notebook.

Louise watches the emperor as he flips through a notebook she's already seen.

"......what."

It's a drawing, and not all monsters are created equal.

However, there are some very similar looking monsters that have been spotted in the notebooks.

The location is different for each.

And they are found thousands of kilometers away.

The more you look at it, the more you realize why the original owner of the notebook drew a picture of a monster.

As the notebook neared its final volume, the emperor's expression grew eerily hardened.

Later, a series of monsters are drawn that look exactly the same.

The discovery location is similar.

And when the Emperor saw the last page of those notebooks, his eyes widened.

Little monsters are drawn.

And there was a short note written on it.

And the neat writing was quite disorganized.

As if to speak for the wavering mind of the author of this notebook.



[Definite immature object].

[He was protected by his mother].

[Monsters are breeding].

[This raises the possibility that the subspecies of monsters that have been discovered so far were actually conspecifics, rather than similar-looking individuals].

[It is likely that many of the monsters already have the ability to reproduce].

[Of the monsters discovered so far, 24 are believed to be capable of reproduction].

[Actually, it's probably more].



The emperor said nothing for a while.

Louise was looking at the emperor's silence, too.

"I need to call them all."

"......Yes."

Louise nodded at the Emperor's words.
