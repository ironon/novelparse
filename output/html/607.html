Most of the lab was working on creating an army.

However, the project is well underway and on track, with completed subjects in full operation.

She was looking for a way to truly bring people back to life.

But that's not all that Louis, Anna, and Christina are focusing on.

I was doing all the things that constitute the next phase, application, and deepening of a project.

Other labs in the quarantine area.

Ludwig, Heinrich, and Louise, nervous that they might be in for another shocking sight, saw something completely unexpected.

It's not a brutal sight, it's not a horrible sight.

"It's a rabbit......?"

"Yes, a rabbit."

Anna nodded at Heinrich's words.

It's literally a rabbit.

A rabbit in a pretty big cage.

There were five cute rabbits in a cage.

They are far too cuddly to be in this place of horrific experiments.

I watched in fascination as the rabbits hopped around in their fairly spacious cage.

So what's the point?

Obviously, he doesn't mean let's watch it together because it's cute.

"Wait....... That's weird."

But as Louise watched the rabbits, she noticed something strange.

There's something a little odd about these seemingly healthy bunnies.

Something is subtle.

"Slightly, like I'm getting a leg up......."

I couldn't help but feel like something was limping along.

"By the way......."

Ludwig doesn't have a bad eye, so when Louise said that, he couldn't help but notice that the rabbits were a bit odd.

"Different lengths."

Louise noticed the length of the rabbits' legs, and that not all of them had balanced front or back feet.

"That's right."

Louis Ankton nods.

"It's a transplanted leg from another object."

Ludwig's eyes widen at that.

"Also, none of those rabbits have ever died."

This time it was Anna's words.

"It's an experiment with a living object."

We're already up to three this week on this project.

Black magic for the undead that animate the dead.

And the homunculus.

Louise mumbles to herself.

"Chimera."

"Yes. Right."

Plus, a chimera.

A branch of magic that synthesizes the best qualities of living things to create the ultimate creature. It is forbidden because it is often used in horrible ways, but it doesn't have to be.

All magic is not about what it is, it's about how you use it.

Transplants a limb from another object.

Everyone in this room knows what that means.

The missing leg.

Or, a missing arm.

You can reverse those things.

"Ludwig....... This is the most basic of chimera experiments."

Transplanting a limb is basic compared to replacing a head or an organ.

The fact that they were dabbling in sake was top secret, so even though they had a way to give Ludwig his missing arm back, they couldn't tell him.

But now that Ludwig has entered the lab and seen everything, they don't have to hide anything from him.

Rather, having learned the secret, he was able to do for Ludwig what he hadn't been able to do for himself.

"I see......."

Chimeric magic can also be developed into limb transplants for those who have lost limbs in war.

Bringing someone back to life is next to impossible.

But giving someone a missing limb is something that can be done.



* * *



They weren't just raising animals in a lab for the heck of it; they were experimenting to see if there was a way to give Ludwig his missing limbs back.

That was easier than creating an army of the undead.

Ludwig couldn't help but be excited at the prospect of regaining his lost arm.

This doesn't just benefit Ludwig. Just as there are countless people who have died in wars, there are countless others who have been injured.

It is not beyond the realm of possibility that they will be able to regain their lost bodies once all of this is finalized and post-war rehabilitation begins. However, this will only be possible after a better understanding of chimeric magic has been achieved.

Depending on how the chimera is used, it could be beneficial to someone. In the end, power is only as good as the hands that wield it.

But sobriety wasn't the only thing he didn't say when he could have given Ludwig his missing arm back.

"It's going to be painful."

"That's fine."

I'd take the pain for the chance to get my arm back.

For that alone, Ludwig was ready for anything.

"Ludwig, it's not just sick, it could be dead."

"...... Is that it?"

"A chimera is not a regeneration, it's a graft, you're implanting a body part that wasn't yours in the first place, you might reject it, you might go into shock."

Louis Ankton looks at the rabbits in the cage.

Ludwig couldn't help but notice that only the successful ones were alive, not the unsuccessful ones.

"The way is easy, but the endurance is on you, and I can't do anything about that."

Ludwig was afraid you would go to extreme measures. If you can afford it, I can give you back the arm you lost in the Chimera procedure.

"I'll do it."

Ludwig nods with a stony expression.

I wasn't going to hesitate because I already knew.

"It's not that we're stuck as we are, but if we can do something more....... why shouldn't we?"

Reached this week.

So Ludwig could see new possibilities.

"Besides, my talent is physical strength."

He says he's confident he won't die because his only advantage is that he's strong.

Ludwig nods with a determined look on his face.

Louise looks at Ludwig and the others as they do so.

The idea of applying chimeric research to make limb transplantation possible is shocking but worthwhile.

And one who is not here, whom the emperor has taken away to talk to.

This lab is the most important area of the house.

So it's clear that the three Temple sophomores are key players in this research.

There are still unresolved issues and mysteries.

But it was clear that what was going on in this lab was more than just horrific and brutal, it was magic far too powerful.

The base is Black Magic.

It's a combination of research on homunculi and chimeras.

And then limb transplants with chimeras.

'These kids....... How in the world can they do so much?

It's not a single field of magic, it's a complex field of magic.

And these three are not just research assistants, they're key players by all appearances.

There is an absolute time limit.

Why are these kids, who are barely out of their twenties, able to do and accomplish so much?

Louise couldn't finish the question, which had a different direction.

Also, it's a port, not a replay.

'The arm to be transplanted is.......'

Probably not from a living person.

Louise's thoughts kept returning to Dettomorian's words.

Said the sullen boy.

If you keep pursuing this, you'll end up killing Ludwig.

That phrase stuck in my head.

As you can tell, I'm a numbers guy.

Numbers can tell you a lot of things, assuming you can read them, so you spend a long time learning how to figure out what they mean, and that's really all there is to it.

By the way.

These days, it's easy to see numbers even if you don't know them.

You know.

These days, that number is, well, shrinking.

A few regular soldiers this time, a few enchanted superhumans this time, a few master classes. A few wizards. A few paladins. A few from somewhere in the refugee camp.

Dead.

How many cities are in a country, or a country, or a country, or how much food is left, or a supply route.

Destroyed.

You'll see numbers like this.

Don't bother reading the dwindling numbers.

Things are getting worse.

If it was this bad yesterday, it's even worse today.

It doesn't really change much, other than knowing more specifically what went wrong.

If there's a number that gets happier as it diminishes, it's the number of warp gates left, although thankfully that's now down to a countable number.

Things were going from bad to worse.

I suppose it could get worse, but that's not going to happen unless humanity disappears altogether.

The Gate spits out an infinite number of monsters, and there is a limit to the humanity that survives.

What happens when no one can fight anymore.

Then it really, really can't get any worse, can it?

Not every night, because I have plenty of wizards around me who can force sleep that doesn't come.

Anyway.

Such, a number.

Combat power.

People who can fight.

People who can still take up arms.

Their absolute numbers are dwindling, and they have absolutely no resources, let alone time, to grow.

Just like that, the number is gone.

Dead people.

Dead soldiers.

Dead knights, wizards.

When you guys suggested that we could quantify those missing numbers and put them back on the list in my documentation as power, I had a lot to think about.

Of course.

It wasn't that I was struggling with the idea that I shouldn't do that.

No, I didn't do it at all, I think I did it very briefly, just a little bit.

Why I thought about it so much.

That would be nice.

I don't think I could ask for much more.

Does that work?

If it does.

What's next?

Okay, then.

I was troubled by what happened next.

Let's say we're done.

Let's say the gate debacle is over.

What happens then.

I thought about it, but I didn't know.

So I gave up trying to figure it out.

First, let's see if it works or not. So, when I saw your output, I had that question.

A more fundamental question.

Things like this.

In such a short time.

Just like that.

Can we do it?

You see, Adelia didn't build Titan alone. Just like you're a genius. You see, Adelia didn't build Titan by herself, just like you are a genius.

That, in turn, required the Duchy of Saint-Thuan, which had the most concentrated technology for golems.

In the first place, the Titan wouldn't have been built without the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan, the owner of the duchy. Would it have been possible for Adelia to design the Titan on her own?

It might have been possible, but it would have taken quite a bit of time, and Adelia's self-deprecating modesty told her it would take more than a decade, though anyone listening might say that's too short.

Now.

By the way.

I've done some pretty bad things, had some pretty mean thoughts, and done some pretty cringe-worthy things.

The Empire doesn't invest in black magic, and as you probably already know, we don't dabble in evil powers.

I knew it was human nature, and my nature, to reach for the silver bullet when backed into a corner in a very specific situation like this one.

In other words, your knowledge of the Empire hasn't helped you much.

Would it take not one, but three Adelia-level geniuses to do that?

Yeah, maybe.

A while back, I had a brief conversation with someone who knows about this issue.

They were worried that they had gotten into bed with some dangerous people.

I said.

'To the best of my knowledge' 'I' have not joined hands with them.

I don't know if they understood me or not.

I didn't catch it, and it's certainly possible that someone else did, but I can't say for sure.

By the way.

Now that I've heard what you just said,.......

It knew something I didn't.

Where you heard it.

I don't know how you know that.

I'm pretty good at keeping people in, though, so there's no way it could have leaked out of my end.

Then I'm guessing you learned about it somewhere else, because that cuts down on the candidates.

So, as it turns out, I was lying back then.

Christina.

Let me ask you a question.

Emperor.

"It looks like you, or at least the three of you, are in cahoots with the Black Order, not me."

Bertus de Gradias asks, looking at Christina.

"Right?"

Christina looked at Bertus and nodded.

"Yeah. Right."

"Is it just you, or does that include the other two who aren't here?"

At Bertus' words, Christina shrugs.

"Well, what do you think?"

Bertus is silent, seeing the look on his face.

Christina may have been the only one working with Order, and it's unclear if the other two knew.

But Bertus is sure the other two know.

Bertus nodded, as if accepting the truth he had suspected.

She's been in contact with the Black Order, and through some means has recently learned the truth.

Her rapidly changing attitude toward Ellen is evidence of this.

"Yeah....... Anyway, the research is complete, and we have enough materials and blueprints that the Empire can maintain the project without you."

Bertus says, and crosses his arms.

"You know those stories, like throwing away your commitment, throwing away the hounds because the hunt is over, that sort of thing."

"......."

The Titan was created by combining the knowledge of the Duchy of St. Thuan with the genius of Adelia.

The Homunculus Undead were also created by combining the knowledge of the Black Order with the genius of these three.

Neither the former nor the latter can be duplicated if the blueprint is already complete. That's a different discipline than general magic.

So the blueprint is complete.

No more Christina, no more Black Order.

"By the way."

But Bertus, who spoke the words himself, narrows his brow.

"You guys aren't stupid, it's not like you didn't see that coming."

If Christina and the others have proposed and carried out this work entirely for the good of the Empire, for the good of humanity, then there is no need for a purge. They are mages who have accomplished great things, even if they cannot be seen by the world.

However, it gets complicated when there are black orders involved.

Their intentions are unknown, hence the need for a purge.

There's no way the Black Order didn't know that, and there's no way Christina and the others didn't know that.

"There must be some kind of safeguard."

I wouldn't have done this without having something in place just in case.

"I know."

Christina looks at Bertus and smiles.

It was a smile of unearthly anger, hatred, and malice.

Even if you know the truth about Gate, very few people will understand it in the end.

There are those who hate everyone.

Even if it wasn't their intention, there's no reason to forgive them.

If someone accidentally pushes a button that will end the world, why should he be absolved of his sins.

It wasn't even a mistake.

The truth is, it doesn't matter.

It's just that you've gone from one person to several.

Just because they are sad beings, where is the reason and justification that they should not be punished?

If someone asks you why people who have done things that are hard to say are wrong should die.

What will they say when they are asked why did the innocent, who did nothing wrong, have to die?

In a world soaked with the blood and tears of the innocent, why shouldn't theirs be? Shouldn't their tears and blood be the first to go?

No one can say for sure.

We all know that death can't save anything.

It's fair to say that there's no reason to add death to death.

Who are we to say that the hearts of the broken and torn need to be heard?

"When you tried to kill us, saying you were obsolete, I was going to tell you that it was the Empire that was obsolete."

Christina's hatred and anger, contempt and murder.

I say with a vengeance for all of this.

"Maybe the emperor isn't doing it for nothing?"

"I thought you said you were thinking about it."

If this is possible, then

It wasn't a consideration of the morality of bringing the dead back to life.

"I'm putting an army in someone else's hands that I can't control, that I can't defeat, that I don't have to think about."

"......Do you even know what a safeguard is?"

Bertus smirked at Christina's slightly surprised reaction.

"What's a safeguard but control?"

"That's right."

The moment the army was formed and completed, Bertus knew it could not belong to the emperor.

It's made with unknown technology. Bertus already knew he couldn't even control it.

I knew it, and I got caught.

You've been caught.

Already faced with the success of his first experiment, Bertus envisioned what would happen when he completed the project.

The gate debacle will be over.

The sacrifice will be small.

Eventually, there will come a time when you'll have to pay another price.

From the moment you make the decision to create that army, you realize that you are not the master of your empire.

I knew.

The project itself was a success.

But Christina is trying to bring the dead Ashur back to life.

But that wasn't the end of it, as she continued to try in vain, she was improving the project itself.

What if you could make the dead move, and even talk, as if they were alive and well?

Bertus was fully aware that someone could do the same to him.

If you bring a dead knight back to life, you can use its powers.

I knew, inevitably, that if I could bring a dead emperor back to life, I could have an empire.
