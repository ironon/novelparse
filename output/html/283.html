            Episode 283





Of course, the emperor doesn't accept just anyone. Nor does he meet with just anyone.

You can start by thinking in terms of results.

If you're a nobody, and you don't even have a year in the palace, the least you can do is save the life of a princess.

Although it's technically the second.

That's why meeting the emperor is a lifetime honor in itself.

But somehow.

I'm not the kind of human being who's going to live with that as a lifelong honor.

Just because the emperor asked to see you doesn't mean you're honored, it means you're worried.

The Emperor knows secrets that many people don't, and it's highly likely that Bertus and Charlotte don't either.

You'll be able to discuss the work of the Revolutionaries without taking sides, and you'll be able to ask questions about the work of the Black Order and other magical organizations.

Or maybe you'll get information about a bunch of highly classified magic and alcoholic beverages.

Setting aside the possibility of whether the emperor will trust the information I give him, and whether he will give me what I want, let's just say yes.

What's the point of contact with the emperor?

It could be temporary, or it could be continuous. As long as my abilities help stabilize Charlotte's condition, it will be the latter.

The Emperor will soon seek to see me.

I'm not sure when that will be, but I'm guessing around the winter break after the festival.

Friday.

The final exam is over.

"Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"

As expected, everyone was happy to see that the dreaded second semester of Kono Lint was over.

It's even a festival, starting next week, so we'll have a week of festivities before winter break.

I haven't gotten my final grades yet, but I think I'll be in the middle of the pack. Of course, I missed a lot of classes, so I won't be at the top because of that.

I didn't pay much attention to it because I wasn't really interested in it in the first place.

Sure, the test was over, but for some, it was just the beginning.

Me at a first grade tournament.

Ellen competing in the Miss Temple pageant.

Cliff Mann competing in Mr. Temple.

Plus, Herriot in an unlimited tournament.

"Harriet, are you sure you're okay?"

"It's okay, I've got it all figured out."

Ellen's entry into Miss Temple was a surprise, but it was Herriot's entry into the Unlimited tournament that shocked everyone. As if being a magic major wasn't bad enough, she's not even a freshman and she's in the Unlimited division.

The qualifiers even start tomorrow.

Qualifiers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, with the main competition taking place Monday through Wednesday.

And starting Thursday, the unlimited tournament will begin.

The winner of the grade-level tournament will receive a spot in the unlimited tournament, but it's up to the individual to decide whether or not to participate.

I haven't decided whether to leave or not. But I think it wouldn't hurt to try. Even if you're not going to win an unlimited tournament anyway, it can't hurt to try.

It's kind of ridiculous that you think you're already a winner before you've even won.

First grade tournament qualifiers starting Saturday.

And Miss & Mr. Temple.

After that, you'll have a vacation, and you'll have to pick up the pieces from there.

Just as Kono Lindt was excited, so was Riana.

He grabbed Ellen and Cliffman by the hand and began to drag them away.

"Let's go!"

"Yes."

"That....... that must go....... Ah, ah, ah, alright, alright! I'll go! I'll go!"

Cliffman started to say something, but when Riana gave him a killing glare, his face fell and he just nodded.

Riana: His tension is high in a different way than Herriot's, but I can see that he's totally excited right now.

I wonder if there's anything he's working that hard on.

By the way.......

The real Miss Temple.

Who the hell am I supposed to vote for?

It's a trade-off between the benefits and the reality, and it's a tough call to make.

No Clifford, no Ellen, so the rehearsal hall will be deserted tonight. I'm guessing they'll be at the Duke's mansion all weekend, only coming back for the preliminaries, and the dorms have already been cleared.

Herriot went to the Hufflepuff house, and for the first time in a long time, there weren't many people in the dormitory.

Anyway, today marks the end of the second semester of my freshman year. A festival is a festival is a festival.

It's winter and there's no one around the Royal Class dorms, but there's something festive about it. Or maybe it's just me, but even though it was cold, I felt strangely excited.

The Student Government Association said that the original main event, the Royal and Orbis Class Competition, has been eliminated and replaced with numerous performances, recitals, and friendly athletic events.

Temple's clubs and even graduate students cooperated, which is a bummer for those who were hoping for a showdown, but what can you do?

I didn't let my guard down.

There were no people in the rehearsal hall, so I had a special lesson with Tana on the viola. Of course, I wasn't alone, Ludwig and Scarlett were there.

Delphine and Erich did not come. Both for their own reasons.

Erich the asshole, he seems to be trying pretty hard these days though, but it's obvious it's not working out. He's got talent, but he's been playing too much.

At least he's talented with a sword.

I have an aptitude for swordsmanship, but no talent. But I am much better than Erich, who has a talent for swordsmanship.

In the end, I realize how much Ellen's presence has helped me.

I was in a situation where I might as well have been gifted with a sword.

With an overachieving genius teaching me, it was inevitable that my progress would be much faster than a kid with a talent for swordsmanship.

In other words, Ellen is my doping potion.

A year is a long time, but it's too short a time for an unknown to dominate the talent pool.

So naturally, I'm forced to reevaluate what I've been doing.

"Well, that's not how you do it.

The words reminded me of Ellen, who started teaching me swordplay.

My efforts, which started with Adriana, really took off when Ellen got involved.

I wouldn't be able to do anything if I were alone.

Maybe he was still living as a lesser man than someone like Erich.

-Carded!

"Okay, but there's a problem with sophistication at full power."

-Keying!

"Don't get excited, Reinhardt. Your most important....... is that it's a shame."

"It's a shame to call it a flaw, isn't it?

I can see it in your face.......

Stop favoring me.......

"Your enchantment is still very unstable. Of course, the fact that you're able to do it at all is admirable. Don't take that as a reprimand."

Saviolin Tana took care of me, and of course Scarlett and Ludwig.

At first, Saviolin Tana was a bit reluctant about Ludwig's excessive fighting. To be fair, she didn't dislike it, but she seemed to be overwhelmed by it.

I'm playing favorites, and Scarlett seems to have a personal favorite.

But.

-Ka-ching!

"Done, I'll do it again!"

-Billion!

"Are you okay?"

"That's okay, we'll do it again!"

-Bang!

"Now that......."

"No, just one more time!"

I could see the difference in Ludwig's mood as he bounced back from the rough handling.

'What is this? Is he a troll?

'I thought talent was fitness.......'

'That's weird.......'

'I wonder what this is.......'

'I'm scared.......'

Ludwig did not lose his initial momentum and asked Tana to make a move.

Ludwig is an overly honest character.

It's not about the honesty of a person, it's about the honesty of a belief.

I may fall short. But I believe I can be better.

I may be weak. But I believe I can be strong.

I may be shaken. But I will grow more because of it.

It's a character with an old-school boy-cartoon sensibility.

It's a clich√©, but it's true.

So, when you meet someone like that in real life, it's kind of intimidating.

Unbreakable human.

A human being who tries again, even after losing dozens of times and falling apart.

"Let's do it again!"

I thought I had gotten horrible.

But instead of gritting his teeth, Ludwig, grateful for the opportunity to fall, twist his wrist, and get beaten up, smiles as he asks Saviolin Tana for a move.

I realized, once and for all, that the real assholes are the ones who do this.

It's been said that the striver never beats the enjoyer.

"Scarlett, while he's doing that, let's do our own thing."

"Ah, yes. Reinhardt."

I was a trying guy.

"Hmph!"

-Ka-ching!

Ludwig was a man who enjoyed himself.

Protagonist.

By the side of a man who saves the world with an unbreakable mind.

-Kagak!

I swung my sword diligently.



* * *



"Reinhardt."

"Uh."

After the special class, Ludwig called me over.

"I thought you were going to the freshman tournament?"

"Right."

"Me and Scarlett are going out, too. You know?"

"Oh, yeah."

This wasn't surprising to me because I thought it was a given. What was surprising was that Scarlett, who would normally have been Miss Temple, was competing in the tournament.

Ludwig said, and pointed toward the smoke screen.

"I'm going to practice some more. I doubt Lord Tana will grant me a favor."

He laughs hysterically.

"If I lose to you so badly, that's rude too, right?"

Ludwig seems to be betting that he can't beat me.

But he'll do his best, because that's what he does.

Make an effort.

Be a good person.

Let's be honest.

It's a weird thing, like a bunch of common phrases that got together and became a person.

"Bye then! Good luck with your qualifying tomorrow, I'll be there!"

"Sure."

Ludwig is much stronger than the original. That's the price you pay for staying out of trouble.

But I have a strange advantage when it comes to being a nuisance.

So I'm definitely stronger than Ludwig now, having been caught up in so many weird things.

However, I wonder if I will be stronger than Ludwig later on.

His unrealistic mind knows no bounds. He must have some sort of warrior bloodline.

Saviolin Tana seems to sense that Ludwig is something of an oddity. Tana seems a bit overwhelmed, but in the end, they have a good synergy.

Having met her in advance, Ludwig will grow stronger than ever before, and at a tremendous rate.

Tana is doing this special lesson to teach me, but it will actually make Ludwig stronger at a tremendous rate.

He'll probably pester Tana for the rest of the vacation. I'm not sure about Tana, but I don't think she's going to shoo Ludwig away when he asks for help.

"Reinhardt."

"Uh, why."

Scarlett called from the hallway of her Class B dorm.

"Would you like to eat?"

"Meals?"

I hadn't eaten dinner because I was in a special class, but it was still a bit surprising to hear Scarlett say this.

"The Empress asked me to join her for dinner if I had time."

Oh, I see.

For some reason, I felt like I was going to a tournament and not get any extra practice.

Since Charlotte's return to the dorm, they've been cautious of each other, greeting each other when they see each other but not talking.
