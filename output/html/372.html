Riana is a different person.

It was inevitable. Riana was actually a very powerful psychic who was growing up on her own.

He had the power, but he had no intention of using it. However, in the face of this situation, Riana was grateful to have the strength she had accumulated in her wasted years, and she was sincerely trying to hone it.

And she wasn't just working on her powers, she was working on her physical fitness, something she'd always hated, and only Cliff was helping her with that.

As a result, it's out of my control that Riana's revenge is on me.

So, who is it that Riana really needs to get back at?

Owen de Getmora, who worked within the revolutionary forces and then betrayed them at a crucial moment?

Shanafel and Saviolin Tana, who may have actually conducted the operation?

Bertus, who planned all this?

Or the emperor who reimposed the plan?

Or.

Turns out, I was the one who set this whole thing in motion?

I don't know which direction Riana should truly take the Knife of Vengeance.

I feel like it's unfair that I'm the one who got hit, but when I think about it, it's not really that unfair.

Riana seeks to be strong.

He wanted it more than any of us.

And just like that, the rest of the winter break flew by.

And, I really need to be prepared.

Prepare to be everyone's enemy.

The moment was fast approaching.

[Achievement Points: 17,730].



So far, I haven't had to use it much, and I'm keeping it as an emergency fund in case something big happens. The last time I used it was during a festival, where I used it as a way to reinforce the Necromancy to create a large gap for the Reverie Rancher.

I strengthened the spirit to bind its movements and plunged the enchanted Tiamata into its heart. From then on, I became the true master of Tiamata, able to transform her into a holy sword or a demonic sword at my will.

Achievement points have always been a very powerful weapon in my arsenal because they can create a lot of variance.

Remaining Achievement Points.

There are quite a few things you can do with this.

Spending 8,000 points will allow you to bloom the fourth talent.

I have three talents: Self-Suggestion, Necromancy, and Magic Control.



[Swordsmanship - 8,000 points].



You need the Combat talent to become a Master Class, but Self-Suggestion already functions as a Combat talent. However, gaining a talent for swordsmanship now can't be a bad thing.

Earning Swordsmanship will speed up your progression to the Master Class.

After spending 8,000 points, you have 9,000 Achievement Points remaining. You'll need 16,000 points to bloom the fifth Talent, so you'll need another 7,000 achievement points to bloom the fifth Talent.

However, I'm torn between two talents.



[Swordsmanship - 8,000 points].

[Bifunctional Resistance - 8,000 points].



You may need resistance to superpowers.

As a divine spirit, you're nearly immune to mind-based magic, and you'll need antimagic, but that can be trained.

But you can't resist superpowers.

If your identity is discovered, you have many enemies.

That would include Riana de Grants. Riana's Blitz ability has become immensely powerful with her Awakening.

Of course, Riana's resistance can be countered to some extent by the shielding provided by her magical enhancements. However, if you have Bifunctional Resistance, you will be somewhat safer from Riana, as well as from other psychics in the real world.

And the real problem isn't Riana.

Scarlett.

Scarlett's immunity renders me completely helpless. I can't use self-suggestion, and I can't use words in the face of a power that nullifies the range of my powers.

Already in tournaments, people have seen Scarlett's power neutralize me. If it turns out I'm a demon, and a fight breaks out, the real danger is Scarlet, not Ellen.

If Scarlett's immunity is classified as a superpower, can she offset it with her ability resistance?

Of course, even if you don't, you can make it happen.



[Add setting].



I've never used it, but you can add a setting to Scarlett's immunity ability that says she can resist it with Dual Resistance.

However, this has the disadvantage of leaving a significant amount of achievement points on the table just to deal with Scarlett. I don't necessarily need to fight Scarlett, so it's a waste of points.

Achievement points are meant to be saved for when it matters, not rendered worthless.

Will I get to the master class faster by acquiring a talent for non-technical skills.

Or do we seek more stability by acquiring bifunctional resistance?

I didn't have to think long.



[Use 8,000 achievement points].

[Talent - 'Swordsmanship'].



Unless there's an urgent need, strive for generality.

My talents are now Swordsmanship, Mind Control, and Self-Suggestion and Necromancy.

The conditions were right for a master class.

You have 9,730 achievement points remaining.

I'd like to save this for just in case.



[Bifunctional resistance - 16,000 points].



I also wanted to make sure I had the ability to resist duplicity, just in case.

Part of me was holding back because I thought having too many talents might raise suspicions.

Is bifunctional resistance also better......?

You can't spit out talent you've eaten.

You've spent a lot of achievement points, and now you need to build them back up.

I don't know if it's the right time to do this, but at the end of the day, achievement points are a more valuable commodity to me than money.

Achievement points are the only ability that can interfere with the world, and challenges are the only way to earn them at this time.

Naturally, the list of challenges is updated periodically.



[Challenge List].

[Identify Akasha - 50,000 points].

[Find Cantus Magna - 30,000 points].



The top two challenges were also aligned with my goals. This isn't going away anytime soon.

At first, ridiculous things like slapping the emperor were at the top of the challenge, and now even the pretentious ones were rewarded with huge amounts of achievement points.

This is no time to play around.

I wanted to.



[Coming out to classmates (cross-dressing competition) - 5,000 points].

[Dating Bertus while cross-dressing - 4,000 points].

[Cross-dressing and dating Kono Lint - 4,000 points].

[Cross-dressing and going out with someone anyway - 2,000 points].

[crossdressing.......]

[Crossdressing! - 500 points].



"......."

Then yes, you son of a bitch.

You're gonna stew in this until I find it, right?



* * *



I decided to forget about achievement points for the time being.

I was so blinded by the achievement points in the first place that I never thought about doing anything else with them after I went to the pageant and saw those snowballs rolling like crazy.

Because it could cause problems beyond embarrassment, and it did.

Gaining the Swordsmanship talent hasn't miraculously increased my swordsmanship. So far, I've mostly been pushing myself with specs.

Absolute skill difference.

My swordsmanship, in pure terms, is second only to Klippmann, Scarlett, and Ludwig. Don't even get me started on Ellen. She's not even close.

I was able to get the upper hand on them partly because of my self-suggestion and partly because of my enchantments.

So my approach was to push the difference in skill into overwhelming physicality.

But now, by acquiring the Swordsmanship Talent, you've been given a future where you'll be ahead of the curve in terms of pure skill.

In the end, in a situation where incremental change was a little faster than dramatic change, I stepped up my training.

One of those days.

Ellen, myself, and Cliffman were huddled in a circle on the stage.

"You think ...... is too weak?"

"Uh."

Cliffman came over with a serious look on his face and asked to speak to Ellen.

"You said you'd help me, but....... As you can see, I hate to say it, but....... Riana's psychic powers were always strong......."

"It's stronger now."

"So."

Riana's psychic powers are extremely strong after an unwanted awakening, and they're only getting stronger. It's a shame that her father's death, anger, and regret are the triggers, but she's stronger for it.

And Cliffman wants to help Riana get her revenge.

By the way.

"I didn't want to....... I don't think it would do any good to tell you that there's really going to be a fight......."

Cliffman thought he had a surplus.

How come this is.......

Why can't we get away from this kind of crap?

Cliffman is on the monster end of the spectrum when it comes to being strong on a general level.

However.

The person he's talking to is you and Ellen.

I, not to mention Ellen, have already gone beyond the orbit of the ordinary and into the orbit of the monstrous.

In other words.

If there's one monster in the Royal Class that's as natural as martial arts, it's me and Ellen. That is, if you count our growth rate rather than our actual skill.

On top of that, the guy who decided to fight alongside him was already a superpower of a very high level, but this time, his abilities suddenly exploded.

In other words, Cliffman, who is not a thousand dollars, but about a thousand, is so overwhelmed by the comparison that his plate seems infinitely smaller.

"Maybe I should be able to enchant myself......."

No this.

You're not supposed to realize that in first grade, and Ellen didn't realize it in first grade, either. It was a weird situation, and she realized it too early. She actually threw up blood and I passed out for a couple of days.

It's just that everyone else's cake is bigger, and he's gotten to the point where he thinks he's a sparrow when he's really a stork.

At this rate, it's clear that Riana is fantasizing that she might have to stay out of the way when she really needs to fight. And if there's a fight going on right now, there's a good chance it will be.

Ellen, as always, stares at Cliff in the distance.

"Don't think too quickly. It doesn't have to be that urgent."

It's one of Ellen's strong suits that she's able to comfort in a nonchalant way.

"We don't know what's going to happen at any given time; the demon might attack the temple right now, or later, when they say it's a threat to them."

Uh.......

If the demon really wants to destroy humanity and wants a demonic war, then maybe.

But not me?

I'm here with you guys!

This is what you mean when you say you feel like you're going to explode, right?

"......Yes."

The problem was that it was believable.

The incident, which was disguised as a demonic attack, led to a number of misconceptions about demonic forces.

In addition to some of the more powerful demons that have been in operation, people have come to believe that demons, including orcs and ogres, are under the control of the Devil.

Add to that the fact that they already have a sizable army.

There are also questions about why the demons attacked in the first place, but as Bertus intended, people were struck with fear of the demons, and few questioned the true reason.

More precisely, it was understood that the Merchant Guild's branch on the outskirts had been unfortunate enough to be attacked while attempting to raid the capital of the small nation of Leviathan.

Soon.

The fear of not knowing when or where the devil's hand will strike lurks in the back of everyone's mind, and Klippmann was no exception.

And.

The Temple, which houses the future of the Empire, is a top priority for the humans to raid.

Royal class there too.

It is the first place the Demon must conquer to fulfill his dreams of grandeur and destroy the future of his empire.

Cliff's anxiety that I'm still too weak, not knowing when I'll be in danger, was compelling regardless of my actual intentions.

Technically, it's too weak for Riana.

"So for now, I'm going to focus on magical sensitivity training, and I was wondering if you could help me with that."

"You already did that."

"...... just didn't work."

"But......."

Cliffman seems to have decided that if you can't get the disenchantment right, it's a non-starter.

But the enchantment was something that Ellen and I had been teaching Kliffman in our spare time.

I've somehow managed to enlighten myself, but Cliffman is still stuck in place.

It's not like you're not practicing it in the first place, so focusing on it is going to miraculously awaken your enchantment? It's not going to happen.

"I get what you're saying, but you and I are the only ones who can enhance our powers during our freshman year, and I hate to break it to you, but we're unusual. We're in our senior year, and there are seniors who haven't gotten the hang of it yet, and if we do it too soon, we could end up destroying our magic circuits and have even worse after-effects......."

"One more, now."

Cliff cut me off mid-sentence.

"What's one more?"

"Someone who can do disenchantment."

Klippmann pointed somewhere.

Apparently, that's where the B-class dorms were.

"Ludwig."

What?

The main character, this asshole.

I don't know the bird, where did he get it?
