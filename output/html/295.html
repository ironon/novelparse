            Episode 295.





The moment I used the enchantment, the outcome was decided before the swords ever crossed.

Before Reinhardt's body was engulfed in blue magic flames, Scarlett had already lost her sword the next moment.

-Ka-ching!

Reinhardt's sword bounced off Scarlett's sword as he lunged forward.

Most martial arts techniques are designed to be used against opponents of the same class. Therefore, a fight between a superhuman and a non-superhuman is not a fight because of skill, but because of the weight class itself.

Weapon loss.

In other words, unable to fight.

-The third set is won by Mr. Reinhardt!

Set 3 ended with a shout out from the moderator.

"What the hell is going on here?"

Olivia didn't seem to understand. She didn't realize that Reinhardt could only use his Enchantment with the aid of Self-Suggestion, so it would seem that he had been deliberately avoiding using it until now.

Ellen and Scarlett are the only ones who know about it.

Ellen was the only one in the room who could see exactly how Reinhardt had grown in that brief moment.

Ellen clenched her fists involuntarily.

'Reinhard.......'

Reinhardt took the next step. No one else could know, but Ellen knew only too well how big a step that was.

I'm so glad it did.

Ellen had to fight back the urge to get up and run to Reinhard.

Ellen's excitement and the audience's bewilderment aside, the game goes on anyway.

Wins and losses are 2:1.

Even if Reinhardt succeeds in enhancing his magic without the aid of psychic powers, it's a double-edged sword.

For the next two sets, you'll have to rely on your magic to beat Scarlett, as you won't be able to use your psychic powers.

But if they do, will they be able to compete in the remaining finals?

We survived the crisis, but it was clear that the win was in doubt.

-Okay, let's go ahead and start set 4.......

However, Scarlett and Reinhardt are facing each other. Suddenly, Scarlett raises her hand.

-Yes, what happened to....... ah.

The emcee's panicked voice echoed through the stadium.

-Scarlett, a first-year rookie in the royal class, declared an abstention.

Abstain.

This out-of-the-blue declaration stunned the audience, as well as his opponent Reinhardt.



* * *



Waiting room.

"Reinhardt needs to win, we can't afford to lose any more steam here.

Scarlett abstained with those words.

It seemed to be satisfied already.

Scarlett wanted to see me not give up. My reaction when my most powerful force and tool, my superpowers, were neutralized.

Scarlett wanted me to get through it somehow, because she always showed me something, and she never gave up, so hopefully this time she would too.

I, somehow, reciprocated that unforced compulsion.

That was the purpose of Scarlet in the first place.

The moment I succeeded in enhancing my powers without the aid of psychic powers, and mastered myself, Scarlett stopped testing me.

If the set had continued, the outcome would have been unclear.

A split second.

It was a short-lived magical enhancement, but it was used without the aid of psychic powers.

My fingertips were tingling and a bizarre pain was coursing through my body, as if every muscle in my body had been torn.

Even with the help of self-suggestion, I couldn't use the power for a long time, and I couldn't help but overload my body even more.

Scarlett could have beaten me. But in the end, when she saw what she wanted, she gave up.

Blah, blah, blah.

I didn't want to, but in the end, Scarlett was playing in the tournament to push me to the next level.

I'm going full throttle. You can do things in this stadium that you can't do in practice.

The crowd went wild, but I went back to the waiting room, and Scarlett went back to tell me to win.

It was an uncomfortable, yet somehow responsible, stare, as if expectations were being imposed. If I had been a normal person, if I had been Reinhardt, I would have told him to cut the crap.

But Scarlett felt indebted to him in more ways than one, so she didn't say anything.

Ludwig and Gladen Amorelle left to prepare for their next match.

So, I was the only one in the waiting room with the first graders, and I was the only one in the stands.

No matter who comes up, I can use self-suggestion this time. Scarlett, my most unexpected adversary, dropped out when I showed him what he was expecting.

Ellen was probably the only one in the audience who noticed my change.

It's been three months since I've been nagged so hard by someone to enchant, and it's been three months since I've had to say no.

This time, however, he succeeded in enhancing his power without the aid of psychic powers.

......Can I have your compliments?

What is it?

I sound like a kid who wants a pat on the back for doing something good.

No, actually, Ellen is also my teacher, so it's not that different, is it?

Anyway, a lonely waiting room.

I sat down to watch the semifinals, which would determine my final opponent, while continuing to self-suggest to get back on track.

How long has it been.

-All right, the second game of the first grade tournament quarterfinals is about to begin!

Ludwig and Gladen Amorell were stepping onto the field.

In the original, Ludwig doesn't get a single set from Gladen Amorelle.

Ellen doesn't give up a single set to such a Gladen Amorelle.

But Ludwig is even stronger than he was in the original.

Still, he's not going to win. He's technically next to Ellen and me at this point. If he ever awakens to the power of magic, he'll be above me in a heartbeat. Except for Scarlet, who is a bit of a special case.

Willpower doesn't always equal power.

I, too, felt uncomfortable in the moment of self-suggestion, knowing that the power I wanted was not in my body.

I had gotten used to my superpowers.

It reminded me of how ridiculous it is to derive power from beliefs that don't have an inherent answer.

But Ludwig decided to stop talking about losing.

The screen illuminates Ludwig's face.

Ludwig, always with a slight smile on his face and a nice, personable expression.

His face was set, cold and hard.

I had never seen that look before.



* * *



Gladen Amorell.

He was an A-1 in Grade 1 of the Orbis Class, and his skills were not at all comparable to the Royal Class, making him a strong prospect for the next generation of the Orbis Class.

You can do it.

You can take down the royalty. Just keep doing what you're doing. No, you can do more, harder.

I've heard that phrase so many times that it's stuck in my head.

He does what he's supposed to do, when he's supposed to do it, better than anyone else.

Gladen Amorell.

Those who, in a sense of forced improvement, thought it was something they had to endure, but found it to be hell and fled from it.

Gladden Amorelle has found a way to laugh and relax.

Now that he's realized that there's no reason he should have to live a forced life, Gladen Amorel is more likely to be nice and kind to others than he used to be.

I don't have to live with the feeling of someone following me around.

But that doesn't mean I'm lazy. In fact, I feel like I've gotten better because I've somehow found the time to focus on the things I want to practice.

The satisfaction of voluntary training.

So while Gladen Amorelle's personality has changed, his skills haven't regressed. In fact, it's safe to say he's evolved.

The man who hadn't laughed in a while smiled again.

However, the relative.

Royal Class B-11 Ludwig.

Ludwig's good-natured, easy-going, friendly face was not smiling now. As if he was determined to do something.

It's as if there's a wall behind you, and once you reach it, it's all over.

A smiling Ludwig pointed his sword at Gladen Amorel.

Reversed, they are pointing their swords at each other.

Gladen Amorell says to Ludwig.

"Sounds like you have your heart in the right place."

"......."

After a moment of silence, Ludwig turns to Gladen Amorelle, his face still stony.

"I'm the last horse in the royal class, which means my talent is good enough to get me into the royal class, but I'm the least talented in the room."

"......, what's your talent?"

"Stamina."

Normally, Ludwig would be grinning like an idiot and scratching his head, but now he was stoic, speaking with a straight face.

"But I had a friend in Class A who was infinite, who didn't have a single talent. Even in Class B, he was talking a lot, saying that Class 11 should be his. Of course, I didn't think so."

"But the point is, he really, really had nothing, not even the slightest advantage of physical strength like I had."

"But he might be weak, but he wasn't weak, and that's not a good thing, but he didn't let all the bad things that happened to him get him down. No matter how many times he got knocked down, no matter how many times he got knocked down, he always got back up, even in those moments when it would have been easy to give up, when it would have been right to give up."

Gladen Amorel seemed to know who Ludwig was talking about.

"I'm the opposite."

"Let's work hard. Whatever it takes, and if I work hard enough, I'll be able to keep up with my incredibly talented classmates, even if I'm losing right now. That's what I believed."

"I was living in the mindset of a loser."

Always wait for later.

I've been too objective about who I am. I'm not good enough for him yet. I'm not good enough for him, so let's work hard. I'm still losing, but one day I'll be able to stand side by side.

I can't help it for now.

"But he knew he shouldn't, but he kept going. Bumping and falling and getting hurt, believing he could win even though he couldn't. I've spent this year trying to do things that are impossible and reckless."

"Right now, I'm much weaker than him."

"Obviously, I was originally stronger than him, but while I was rationalizing a lot of other things based on the idea that I was working harder, he was outrunning me and going the distance."

"While I was hiding behind excuses for myself, telling myself that I'm just working hard enough, he was tackling the impossible. Something that shouldn't be possible, but he believed it could be."

"Yeah. I admire Reinhardt."

"To catch up to this distance that has already been caught up."

"I think that's what I need to do from now on."

"I can't, but I believe I should, and I'm going to do it, because Reinhardt said I should believe it."

"I'm not going to hide behind the excuse that I'm working harder now, because that's just going to keep me stuck."

Ludwig grips his sword and looks at Gladen Amorel.

Gone is Ludwig, the bottom of the class B who accepted reality and resigned himself to it in the name of hard work and grit.

Changes.

Now, I don't console myself by saying I'll do my best.

To do well, not hard.

Not to do your best, but to win.

"So."

You find yourself scratching your head at all the things that didn't work out, saying that it will work out better later.

Now discard it.

Willpower is not power.

However, there is only one person in the world who knows the truth about this world.

Will is not power, but Ludwig is the hero of this world.

Causal nuclei.

By their very nature, protagonists can turn their will into power.

Such a protagonist.

Ludwig declares.

"I."

"Null."

"Win."

The world is, and always will be, on his side.



* * *



What the fuck is that?

I couldn't help but roll my eyes at the quarterfinal results.

The score was 3:0 in favor of Ludwig.

We seemed to be having a conversation, but when the duel started, things didn't go the way I thought they would.

Ludwig's sword struck Gladen Amorel with overwhelming force.

It's not even a disenchantment.

It's not like you have superpowers.

Ludwig used his physical strength alone to counteract every sword Gladen Amorell threw at him and stabbed back.

Overwhelming weight class difference.

Something that could only be done with a magical enhancement, Ludwig had done with his bare hands.

People in the audience stared at Ludwig, who had just defeated Gladen Amorell with monstrous strength.

-Waaaaaah!

While those who don't know the situation are thrilled by the overwhelming and enormous fight itself, I'm left speechless.

That's not the kind of speed and reaction you can get without a disenchantment.

We don't know what we did, but Ludwig is different.

This is bad enough without enchantments, but with enchantments, you're going to be even crazier.

I could tell that my words from yesterday had somehow resonated with Ludwig.

Will cannot be power. Except for me, who has the power of self-suggestion and word.

I watched as a stern-faced Ludwig stood tall amidst the cheers of the crowd.

I realized what I was overlooking.

Saviolin Tana, the current reigning world champion.

Ellen, the next worldbuilder.

Olivia Ranze, another World's Strongest candidate who survived when she should have died.

One of the most talented people in the history of magic, Herriot de Saint-Ouen.

And I, who had the gift of infinity and grew tremendously in a year.

What the hell.

-Waaaaaah!

In the end, the main character is Ludwig.

The protagonist can turn will into power. Anger, sorrow, vengeance, and desire can be transformed into strength, giving them unbelievable power. The world bends to Ludwig's wishes, even if there is no reason for it.

When you need strength, use strength.

In situations where deferral is required, use deferred.

The power I have.

Self-implication is, after all, a degradation of Ludwig's power.

The power to turn will into power was originally Ludwig's.

The world is built for the protagonist, and Ludwig will have everything he needs.

Ludwig looks somewhere.

To be precise, look at the inner bleachers.

I look through the window at Ludwig.

Ludwig looks up at me.

The guy who said he'd meet me in the finals, did meet me in the finals.



* * *



Nothing worked out the way I thought it would.

Nothing is easy, just as it was foolish to believe that a 10,000 achievement point challenge would be easy in the first place.

I struggled against Scarlett, who I hadn't really considered, and it looked like I was going to lose, but his withdrawal put me in the final.

Gladen Amorelle was eliminated by Ludwig by an overwhelming margin.

If I work hard enough, I'll get to you guys someday.

Ludwig, who believed so, abandoned his weakness.

A situation that is so different from the original plot that it is now impossible to predict and has become meaningless.

You're not awakening an enchantment, and you're not using superpowers.

It's just a protagonist.

That one advantage made Ludwig stronger.

After a short break, it's time for the finals.

You're not feeling your best. But that doesn't mean you're in bad shape.

If you use Self-Suggestion, you'll be able to match Ludwig, and if you use Enchantment, you'll be able to overwhelm him.

But you don't know if it's going to make it to 3 sets or not.

If I don't get it right, I'll be in the pathetic position of not losing to Ludwig, but losing to a failure to condition.

-The long-awaited final stage is about to begin: the battle between Royal Class A and Class B!

I see you're avoiding the whole "battle of the bottom" thing.

Ludwig and I were facing each other as the moderator spoke. Our faces, which had been smiling, had hardened.

Now there's a look I like.

Ludwig, who had been lacking in seriousness, became serious.

"I guess that worked, huh?"

"...... I think it was."

Ludwig seemed to have a hard time believing what had happened to him. Ludwig stares at me.

"I wonder if I can follow you."

"You haven't learned yet. Asshole."

Holding the sword, I smile at Ludwig.

"Don't think you can keep up. No, think you can trample over things like you and stand on top of them."

"Haha....... Yeah. That's right. Something like that."

Ludwig looks at me with a smile. But it's not the coy smile he's been showing me.

"Well, that's odd, Reinhardt, you're certainly strong, but there are plenty of people stronger than you......."

Ludwig grips his sword and sighs.

"At some point, ....... doesn't work."

"What?"

"That I beat you."

The smile fades from Ludwig's face once more.

"Well, I can't quite picture it."

That look on Ludwig's face, those words, I knew.

Because there is only one being who thinks so.

The one who will be looking at me from the audience.

There are many who are stronger than him, and many who are better than him.

But. I can't picture myself defeating Ellen Artorius. She'll always be the same, looking down on me from a vantage point far above me, and teaching me swordsmanship.

In the original, Ellen was that to Ludwig.

A wall you can't follow, no matter how hard you try. Something you always have to look up at.

Now, it's my job to look at Ellen.

"You're getting stronger so fast that no matter how hard I try to keep up, you're going to be way ahead of me."

No wonder.

Ellen came in already strong, but I started from a worse position than Ludwig and faded away.

That's why Ludwig's eyes are on me, not Ellen.

I can't help but think, why can't I be like Reinhardt?

Ludwig was feeling barriers to me, not Ellen, and he was forced to make me his object.

Ellen may be stronger than me, but Ludwig's goal is to overtake me.

An insurmountable wall.

For Ludwig, the wall had become me, not Ellen.

Ellen's place in the original is now mine.

The long-awaited finals of the 1st grade tournament are here!

The protagonist's eternal rival and object of admiration.

That's my role in this world.

"I don't think so, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt."

Ludwig takes a deep breath.

"I can beat you."

I sheathe my sword. I turn to face Ludwig.

I only taught Ludwig one thing.

Make resolutions for victory, not excuses for defeat.

It's not much, but it's what I taught them after all.

"No."

And, it's my specialty.

"You, you can't beat me."





Ludwig looks at me and says

"I."

I look at Ludwig and say.

"I."

And we look at each other and say at the same time

"You. I win."

-Kurung!

Blue magic enveloped my body, and Ludwig leapt at me, stomping his feet.

-Quack!

The moment their swords clashed, they shattered as if they had made a promise.
