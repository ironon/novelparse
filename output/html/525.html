            Episode 525.





Late afternoon. Scheduled appointment location.

"......?"

From a hidden spot on the outskirts of the garrison, Herriot could see a black cat approaching in the distance.

"......cat?"

She froze as she watched the cat grow larger and larger as it approached, soon taking the shape of a familiar human.

"Reinhardt?"

"......."

Reinhardt was shaken by what had happened in just one day.

"What, you can turn into a cat, and since when?"

Herriot panics when a cat appears out of nowhere and turns into Reinhardt.

"For now....... Let's go back to Edina. I'll go tell her."

Reinhardt, his mouth tightly closed, had a lot of things he couldn't say.



* * *



The royal castle of Razak, capital of Edina.

"......Ah, you couldn't get into the Royal Class Garrison in human form, so you turned into a cat?"

"Yeah, and Sarkegar threw me out there?"

He spent hours trying to teach me this and that, and then when he realized I had no clue, he dumped me in the garrison and ran off!

He told me that if I went to Moro, I'd only have to go to Seoul, and that it would work out because it was cute.

I thought I'd be able to get it out on my own!

Sarkegar....... I thought you were a loyalist.

Did I have anything stacked against me?

Isn't it weird that there's nothing stacked?

Considering the long, long history of pooh-poohing, it's kind of weird not to feel guilty, right?

Isn't it a good thing we've been so forgiving?

"Whoa, my original plan was to turn into a cat and then hide here and there to eavesdrop on the conversation, and if I got caught, I figured I'd just be cute and get away with it......."

"So it's the other way around?"

"......, so to speak."

"......."

Eventually, the aggro of the entire royal class gravitated toward me, and I even spent a night in Ellen's tent afterward.

I like how this turned out.

Along the way, there were too many memories I didn't want to relive.

"Konorint that son of a bitch is......."

"Konorint? What's wrong with him?"

"......No, it's not."

"What, what happened?"

I don't even want to think about it!

"Is he the kind of kid who bullies animals?"

"No, that's not right......."

"Then why are you upset?"

Well, that was a nice touch.

I know you were trying to get me a little something!

If it weren't for her, I'd be Lily!

"No. I really don't want to talk about it......."

"...... Something must have happened."

We've had a lot of surprises along the way, but I can't help but feel that we've done well.

I wasn't spying on them, but I was getting a front row seat to the royal class, one by one.

I even got the closest look at Ellen, which is what I wanted to see the most.

I also checked in with Adriana to see how she was doing.

Ellen is a demigod.

I don't know if that was an influence or not, but Ellen was definitely holding up better than I was.

Maybe there's a difference between the spirits trying to kill me, but no reason to try to kill Ellen.

I don't know how long that will last, but it's clear that Ellen is handling it better than I am.

But maybe we should be more afraid that even Ellen, a half-god, is being eaten by it.

Sarkegar would stay at the garrison to synthesize the information, and I would be the only one back.

"The other units, by the way?"

"I guess they're still in the game, because we ended it too early."

"Sure."

Our mission was quickly cut short when Riana summoned a blizzard, turning the area into a sea of deathly snow.

The other units, led by the Lord Vampires, are still operating.

When the Allied advance resumes, we begin our work once again.

I also checked the status of the garrison.

"And Heinrich?"

And something that's important enough that it's kind of Ellen's job right now.

"I did send a letter through Sarkeghar, but it's not in......."

We've been warned, but the jury is still out on what will happen next.



* * *



We know that letters are delivered all over the garrison, including the Royal Class garrison. So it's a no-brainer to slip a letter through Sarkegar.

However, I don't think it's a complete solution to the problem.

"Can a letter be....... in one letter?"

Herriot looked at me nervously.

"We could talk about it in person....... obviously."

"Yeah, so maybe we should talk about it a little more?"

I couldn't agree more with Herriot.

In fact, as much as I hate to think about it, that's exactly how Harriet talked to Ellen.

"Information is only as good as its source."

"......."

"What guarantee do I have that Heinrich will take my word for it? He might think it's a ruse to distract the Allies."

Very few people know the truth about Gate. So there are very few people who will believe me, and Heinrich is not one of them.

Any contact with Bertus is dangerous to him, not me, and I can't have any more contact with Ellen.

At best, you'll eventually come face to face with it, as I did this time, in cat form.

That's a pain in the ass, too.

I told him to come back, by the way.

I never intended for this to happen, but it's good for Ellen to visit her regularly. What's the point of visiting Ellen as a cat?

I wouldn't say it's nonexistent, but I also don't think it means much.

Things got weird, and I started to wonder if Ellen would be sad if I didn't visit her.

Sarkegar, you were so irresponsible.

When you get back, the real.......

Real.......

I'm guilty of so many sins, I can't blame you.

It's now impossible to say anything to Sarkegar, who has been the most pampered of all.

In fact, in the end, I was more successful at gathering information than I needed to be.

Anyway.

Talking to someone in the Alliance in the name of Darklands should be avoided at all costs.

"I'm sure there's a lot of people I lived with at the Temple who would kill for a snowball's chance in hell, and that includes you, Olivia, and Riana."

I can forgive my cat, but I can't forgive myself. That's just the way it is.

It's not just that this happened to me.

Most students lost their homes and families.

Unless you're from the ecliptic, it's happened to quite a few people.

So I would be an ironclad support for them.

And there I was in the cafeteria in my kitten form, eavesdropping on conversations between students.

Of course, most of them were talking about cats, but I also heard stories from beyond.

Hate for me.

There was also a fairly large segment of the population that had been swallowed up by it and didn't care about kittens at all.

For example, Ludwig.

I could feel that something had changed drastically since Ashur's death.

We don't know what's going on in Cliffman's mind, but we do know that the formerly shy and reserved Cliffman is now less talkative in a different way.

When the topic of demons came up, the mood was subdued.

The arrival of the kittens seemed to lighten the mood.

It's one thing to hear it and quite another to see it.

I saw it with a cat's eye and felt the atmosphere of royal class firsthand.

There are a lot of people who will never forgive me.

Does knowing the details make a difference?

What if people realized that Ellen and Charlotte and Bertus and Gradias were also responsible?

They will hate Ellen with me, and the Empire with them.

We've seen that it's just the beginning of an era of hate that won't end until everything is destroyed.

Heinrich didn't lose his family, but he's in the midst of them.

So if I or my people go and tell you that truth, you're not going to believe it, you're going to doubt it.

So, I'd rather be anonymous.

I don't want Heinrich to know that I'm the source of the information, because that might make him not believe me.

If they know the truth about the gate situation, that's a bigger problem.

You'll learn that I, and the Imperial Family, were responsible for the Gate debacle in the first place, and that we've been hiding it all this time.

It's better not to know the truth.

The mere knowledge of it is bound to divide the alliance.

"But....... How do you know that's going to happen?"

I stare out the window at Harriet's question.

Know the future.

But that means nothing now. Because now I don't know the future.

Except for "that future" that you see in the preview.

"Because sometimes things that happen between people are just too obvious."

The people are the same, the power dynamics are the same, and they start to change.

Then the events in the change that were supposed to happen will continue to happen.

Herriot seemed to think I was being a little disingenuous.

Heinrich von Schwarz is an abandoned prince.

As a child, he accidentally killed his brothers while awakening to his powers.

That's why they were kicked out of the temple.

So in the early days of the Temple, I didn't really fear any repercussions for beating Heinrich. I knew that the Cernstadt royal family had no interest in Heinrich.

"Still, I can't predict everything....... It's also not my area of expertise......."

I did that because I know the people and events I created, not because I know the complex dynamics of politics.

So, what happens after that should be handled by a professional.

And as always, there's a good chance there's something else I'm not aware of.

This doesn't mean there aren't hidden things going on.

Charlotte would be able to tell me what more I need to do here, what more I need to know.

"But you know what......."

"Huh?"

But then Harriet turns and looks at me.

"I want to see it too."

"What? What did you see?"

"I just didn't see it right."

a.

I think I know what you're talking about.

"No....... Why would anyone want to see that?"

"It's just interesting, huh? No?"

Herriot came running up to me in a frenzy of excitement.

No, I mean, what's with the cat?

Actually, I don't like cats that much.

There's nothing to love about a cat that used to make weird noises all over the neighborhood when she was in heat. I've never owned one.

I chose it because it's easier to hide than a dog, and I don't think I'll ever need a leash. And because cubs are kind of cute.

And actually, when the whole Royal Class garrison came to see me, I was like, "What's so great about this, they're all lighting up!

I think it's cute.

This much for something so cute, even in the middle of a barren, bloody war zone?

That was it.

Even I didn't expect Ellen to be so interested!

I don't want to turn into a cat!

I still don't know how to operate it, so I'm not sure what to do either!

I can walk and run now, but I don't know how to do much more than that.

"Mmmm, do it, do it, do it, do it. Hmm?"

This.

Won't she cry if I don't?

No, but what does it want to see so badly?

It's been so long since I've seen Herriot this excited, it's almost embarrassing.

"......No."

It's not much different on the other side, but when Harriet does this, I can't say no.

"How did this happen......."

In the end, I lost.

I can't look away from Herriot's sparkling eyes.

I used Sarkegar's ring again.

After some time, Herriot looks down at me, who has turned into a small black cat.

Uh.

By the way.

As it gets smaller, the.

If the angle is less than that.

"It's ......, it's you!"

Herriot hastily covered the hem of her skirt.

-Hello!

No!

You're the one who asked me to change!

This is the second time I've done this, and I don't know what to expect!

Harriet pulls back, her face gaping, and looks at me on her knees.

"Ooh, wow......."

Herriot came to me on his knees, and with a sweep, he scooped me up like a cat.

-Hello!

"Awww, ears, how cute!"

Harriet hugs me fiercely.

It's reaction rich.

"I love you!"

-Cat!

Break your back!



* * *



Edina's scribe, Herriot de Saint-Ouen, suddenly started wandering around the castle with a cat in his arms.

"Mr. Scribe, do you have a cat?"

"Yes! Isn't that cute?"

"Oh, yeah....... Your ears, they're cute......."

Herriot held up a scowling black cat to the vassals and purred, "Isn't that cute?

Holding the cat in her arms, which somehow felt forced, she showed it off everywhere.

Everyone was quite pleased to see the scribe, who had always been so grown-up and serious, laughing around like a kid his age.

Many people fear the devil, but the scribe was certainly making a good impression on everyone.

When you're out and about like that, you're bound to run into people.

"......What is it, a cat or you?"

Olivia Ranze was no exception, as she traveled to the palace to speak with the regent.

"Cute, right?"

"......What's with the cute cat face, and I don't like cats, they're cheap, on the subject of animals."

"......."

Olivia's words brought a smile of conversion to Herriot's face. Olivia narrowed her eyes at the questioning smile on Herriot's face.

"Ha, I see you're trying to makeover with a cat. You're disqualified because you've been sleeping with Reinhardt for half a year and haven't slept with him."

"Hmph, hmph....... Really?"

Olivia's expression froze under Herriot's caustic gaze.

Because a dreaded speculation came to mind.

"What? You can't be......?"

"Hmm, I don't know about that, we'll see."

Herriot scooped up the cat with a flourish and kissed the black feline.

-Hello!

"Cute, right?"

"......what's up, what's up."

Then, Olivia looked.

The cat suddenly transforms into a human form in an instant in Harriet's hands.

"Hey! What are you doing!"

Reinhardt, his face gaping, covered his mouth and grunted.

"????"

"What, I said I was going to kiss my cat!"

"Why am I your cat!"

"What, what, what....... What the hell? What the hell is this?! What's going on?"

Olivia watched, frozen, as the cat-turned-human threw a fit.

"This....... you damn kid!"

Olivia squealed, and Harriet giggled as Wang Sung walked away.

"Me too! I love puppies!"

"What are you talking about, both of you!"

This time, Olivia's request to turn into a puppy wasn't a plea.

Reinhard tried to embarrass Olivia by transforming into a dog the size of a wolf, but Olivia thought the bigger the better.
