            Episode 462.





Things were better inside the city center, but in the shanty towns where the refugees live, one wonders if they will survive this winter.

Even an empire can't abandon them after all.

In front of a long line of people who were being rationed, I could see guards handing out something.

-Thump!

-I said no!

-Grandpa....... He might die from this.......

A loud noise came from somewhere in the shantytown.

-I don't think I'm going to be treated by a bunch of priests serving a filthy devil! I'm just going to die! Cancer! I'm going to die!

In one of the shacks, a priest, dressed in white robes soiled from being kicked out, slowly got up with a depressed look on his face.

Cult of Tuan and Alth.

People began to reject the gods in favor of demons.

Over the chatter of the crowd, Tuan watched the priest walk off into the distance, his head bowed in melancholy.

I didn't need to see this spectacle.

Enough about the reality of the empire.

But I couldn't leave easily.

I feel like it's my responsibility to put all of this spectacle in your eyes. I feel like that's the least I can do.

I knew that looking at all the horrible things that had happened to me wouldn't solve anything, but it seemed like the least I could do.

I pass endless vistas of broken lives.

As we approached the outskirts, the situation became more dire.

I could see maggots and flies clinging to the dead bodies between the shacks.

The Empire cannot support all these people.

You save people somehow, but if the people you save end up starving to death, what's the point of saving them?

The only outcome is death by monsters or slow death by starvation.

Just as I run mages to grow food in the Edina Archipelago, the Empire is doing something similar.

Add to that the manpower required by the Empire to defend this vast territory from monsters.

In addition to supporting existing empires, there are also people working to end the gate crisis.

The Edina Archipelago is a state where all resources can be used to support its people, but the Empire is not.

So people were dying for nothing in places the empire couldn't do anything about.

There is no anger or hatred in people's faces when they are overly desperate.

Shadowed by death, they lay in the streets, slowly dying because they didn't have the strength to resent the world.

We were almost to the edge of the refugee zone.

-Bang!

-Grrrrrrrrr!

-Crack!

-Monster!

I could see the monster rampaging through the shacks, smashing them to pieces.

A monster of a gate that came in from somewhere.

There are no guards in the middle of nowhere.

Even if it does, we don't know if it will be able to handle it or not.

A four-meter-tall monster with the face of a boar and the body of a gorilla.

Not many, but one object.

It doesn't seem like a very powerful entity, but if left alone, people in the refugee camps would be dying by the hundreds.

Civilians can't do anything about it.

In a no-man's land, it only takes one of those monsters to slip through, and people are dying by the hundreds.

There was no time to waste.

I run, activating the magic in my body.

It's a long way, but it's not like I'm going to be able to cover that distance in my mainstream car.

-Thump! Quack!

-Run! Run!

Rushing to the middle of a spectacle of people being mashed and crushed.

"Suck!"

-Woof!

As you raise your fist, you convert the energy in your fist into destructive power.

-Quack!

With a single blow of his enchanted fist, the creature's head exploded.

Although we still haven't reached the master class.

I am stronger than ever before.

I didn't make it to the master class, but that doesn't mean I'm out of my depth.

Comprehensive Ability Assessment - Demon

Combat Level Assessment - S



You earn achievement points for each monster you kill, just like you earn experience points.

Over the course of two years, as Edina's work increased, she became less and less involved in direct combat, but in the early days, she had to fight without a break to breathe.

It was a day of tearing up the land of monsters.

I invested my mountains of achievement points into bettering myself.

Personally, I wanted to maximize my horsepower numbers, but after reaching SS rank, it became impossible to invest.

I was unable to buy the top talents that had become too expensive, but I was able to re-bloom some talents.

But he had to focus on the business of being a king, so he spent more time on the throne after the initial fights.

That's why some of them never made it to the next level.

However, my basic physical abilities were extremely advanced, and my power levels had risen to bizarre heights, so I found myself in a situation where my power output was comparable to that of any master.

Without ever reaching the next level, they've developed a malformed growth spurt in which their basic abilities have become hypertrophied.

So the output itself is no less than any other master, and even more so. It just lacks sophistication and versatility.

In terms of horsepower, I'm now on par with Xavier Tana.

Of course, I'm not sure I'd win a fight with her.

-Woof!

The headless monster's body collapsed.

I was covered in the monster's flesh and blood, but it didn't stain my clothes because it ran off the magical barrier that covered my body.

In that short time, the monster had killed about a dozen people.

This happened less than a minute after the monster appeared.

-Ohh.......

-who, who......?

The fleeing men stared in disbelief as I neutralized the monster in one fell swoop.

He's been transformed by Sarkhegar's ring anyway.

No one will recognize me.

You don't have to explain anything, you don't have to say anything.

The moment you're about to leave.

-Cool!

Something like blood bubbled up from the dead monster's carcass, and something began to rise.

Tentacles.

Tentacles, as sharp as the awls that lurked in the corpse, shoot out, aimed at me.

"!"

-Ka-ching!

I summoned Alsbringer and struck down the tentacles.

The impact was too fierce for the sound of flesh and sword.

No matter how great my magical defense is, monsters are unpredictable.

I thought it was dead, but tentacles poke out of its corpse.

-Bam!

The flames from the fires of Hwaryo consumed the creature's body, as well as its flailing tentacles.

"......."

People look at me.

-that one.......

-that black.......

The way people look at me is fixed on my sword.

Recognizing holy relics is basically the food chain.

But the devil has two holy relics.

Alsbringer and Tiamata's looks have become as famous as Ellen's laments and lapel pins.

That's why people recognize it.

"Ma....... 魔王......."

One of the people who's fallen and is screaming points a finger at me.

"The mark of the devil!"

Mark of the Devil.

That was the new name for Alsbringer and Tiamata.

People gradually began to panic and run away.

-The king is here!

I didn't do it in hopes that anyone would notice anyway.

We already know enough about gradients.

I pulled out my scrollbook and unfolded the teleport scroll.

Watching them flee in terror, I stood still until the light of the teleport engulfed me.

"What do you mean the devil has appeared?"

Just before Ellen left the ecliptic, she heard a strange story being talked about and came straight to the imperial palace.

Demon.

As soon as she heard those words, Ellen's mind seemed to go blank.

I couldn't bear not to hear what was going on.

So even Ellen couldn't afford the rudeness of a surprise visit from the emperor.

It was time to go to bed, but Bertus was in his office.

Bertus held his right hand to his temple, muttering to himself.

"It's not the first time I've seen bullshit come out of the refugee zone......."

The words sent a chill down Ellen's spine.

Rumor.

It's not uncommon for people to see things out of fear and panic.

Ellen felt a crack in her heart as she realized that she had finally been swayed by such a story.

"Technically, I think I saw an Alsbringer, not a demon, though I'm pretty sure it's an Alsbringer based on the physical description....... Then Reinhardt must be right."

Ellen's lips trembled as she heard the words.

If you've seen the Alsbringer, you've seen a demon, because its owner can't be anything else.

"They're saying strange things, that the devil brought monsters, killed the refugees, and disappeared......."

The little bird story had spread like wildfire. Ellen shook her head vigorously.

"No way....... You don't......."

"Of course, I don't know why or for what reason, but there was a monster on the outskirts, and Reinhardt killed it and went off somewhere, and who's going to believe the story that the devil saved the people?"

The monster that was attacking the refugees was killed by the demon and disappeared.

Those who saw it firsthand saw the demon slay the monster, but those who didn't only heard the story of the monster killing the refugees from afar and then the demon appearing.

The truth, that the demon had slain the monster that was killing the refugees and then mysteriously disappeared, was buried among the rumors that spread like wildfire.

The devil saved the people.

People don't believe it because there's no reason why the devil should.

So, a credible lie was about to become the truth.

"Damn, I wonder if Reinhardt felt this way......."

"......."

Ellen and Bertus were feeling Reinhardt's frustration in real time.

There's no reason for Reinhardt to do that.

If you really want to raid the outskirts of the refugees, you can't just bring in a single monster.

People believe what they want to believe out of fear.

I don't buy the story that Reinhardt would have burned down a whole neighborhood of refugees if he'd tried to raid properly.

I don't believe it because I can't believe it.

Truth doesn't work with a crowd that has gone mad with fear and hate.

How to believe in the devil.

Ellen and Bertus, who had distrusted Reinhardt under this notion, were now forced to watch with a pinched feeling in their stomachs as a believable lie, not the truth, spread among the crowd.

"That aside, what the hell was Reinhardt doing here......."

Ellen shared Bertus's doubts.

During this time, the Demon King, who had been unheard of since leaving the ecliptic, appeared in the ecliptic.

Suddenly, Ellen remembered how, not long ago, she had felt the sensation of being watched.

That uncanny sensation, the feeling that it must be an illusion.

No way.

"......No way.

When it occurred to her that it might have been Reinhardt, Ellen felt a pang of self-doubt.

On the subject of not trusting Reinhardt.

You're still under the delusion that Reinhardt might be thinking of you.

To think that Reinhardt might have been watching her, Ellen realized how ridiculous her delusions were, and how similar they were.

Reinhardt explains why this should be the case.

We don't know where, but Reinhardt has gone somewhere with people who believe in him.

There's no reason to find yourself again, no reason to wait and see.

It's been two years.

In the midst of all this misery, Reinhardt must have forgotten about himself.

Reinhardt didn't do anything wrong to Ellen.

The only person to blame is yourself.

So Reinhardt can forget himself. He has been betrayed.

He can't forget Reinhardt himself. He betrayed him.

That's why Ellen thinks it's impossible that Reinhard remembers her, that he remembers her, and that there's even the slightest bit of that left in him.

I don't think I deserve it, and I don't think I'm worthy of it.

"What the hell....... Why are you here......."

So why not the ecliptic, where it has never been before.

Why it appeared.

Neither Ellen nor Bertus could figure out why.

Royal Castle, main port city of Razak, Edina Archipelago.

When I returned, Harriet stripped me of the robe I was wearing and wrapped it around me with both hands.

"How was the empire?"

"...... is not good, even in jest."

"......What was it?"

"We've long since passed the population limit of what the ecliptic can support. People come in droves, and we have to worry about them all starving to death. There's no policing at all in the outlying areas, and if you stumble across the wrong horde of monsters, not criminals, you'll be dead by the thousand in ten minutes."

At my words, Harriet let out a deep sigh.

"And then there was a monster in the Outer Rim, and it wore an Alsbringer, and I'm sure there will be sightings of me on the ecliptic....... I don't think it's going to happen, but I can see how this could turn into a rumor....... I don't know how this will affect me later."

"Alsbringer?"

"Uh, there's a slightly dangerous situation."

"Yeah, well, I'm glad you didn't get hurt anyway."

Harriet and I walked side by side through the bustling hallways.

The Devil appeared on the ecliptic.

I didn't do anything spectacular, but the story that I showed up is bound to have a huge impact on the ecliptic.

The majority of the crowd now knows that a demon could appear on the ecliptic at any time.

People are more afraid of me, and they might panic.

Should I have summoned Alsbringer despite the risk?

But there are plenty of monsters that can pierce Auror armor. Swordmasters don't die for nothing.

We don't know how the Demon's appearance will spread terror across the ecliptic.

Maybe I should have left it alone instead of taking matters into my own hands.

The thought of it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.

Now I'm afraid to think about it casually.

Antirrhinus had told me about the ups and downs of the ecliptic, but seeing it with my own eyes made it all the more real.

The Edina Archipelago had its own problems with food, but compared to the ecliptic, it was a paradise. There were definitely people starving, but no one was dying.
