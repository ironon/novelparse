The next day.

"I'm going to try."

Klippmann said, sounding determined.

Of course I did, and then I spent a long time agonizing over the Mr. Temple entry form.

Ellen and Harriet seemed to have already signed up. Both seem to know that the other is going to the tournament and Miss Temple.

"You want me to just close my eyes and write?"

"Well, it was a bit of a pain in the ass to write......."

In the lobby of the dorm, Kliffman had become a wrecking ball over a piece of paper, and I was trying to convince him to just use it when he made up his mind.

After a while, Liana de Granz walked up to us.

"What are you guys doing?"

"Oh, he, he....... that......."

Cliffman stuttered when Riana suddenly spoke to him. He's especially vulnerable to girls who come in with a hook. Ellen does it to him, and Riana does it too, though in a different way.

In fact, Riana has very few boundaries between friend and foe. She'll talk to anyone, and she's not shy about it.

Cliffman stammered, unable to answer at all, so I finally spoke up.

"Mr. Temple is leaving."

"......?"

At that, Riana frowned. She looks like she's heard something wrong.

No, who am I to judge, and it's not me.

"Only Cliff is going out, not me."

"......?"

"......."

Same reaction.

Wow.

You?

This one?

You have a way with words, man.

Cliffman looked like he'd been caught dreaming. Riana sat down across from him and stared at his face.

"Hmmm."

Unspecified traces.

Riana didn't say anything about why you'd leave something like that, or whether you should or shouldn't.

He just stared at me and seemed to be thinking about something.

"That, that....... That....... That's a bit much....... Ah, aha. Ahaha......."

Cliffman scratched his head and reached for the application, thinking that this had to stop.

I guess that doesn't work either.

-Tak!

"Ugh."

But as Kliffman reached for the application, Riana slapped his hand away.

"Give."

"Uh, huh?"

"I've been thinking, "What's the big deal about using this stuff?"

Riana looks like she's having fun.

Come to think of it, he's technically the real A-lister.

She's talented, but she has no interest in studying, and she comes from a wealthy family that spends money like it's nothing. It's exam time and he's pissed off that he's being forced to study by Ellen, Adelia, and Harriet.

He was too excited to miss out on the fun.

Riana started filling out the application, including Klippmann's name and affiliation.

"When's your birthday."

"Uh, well, that's......."

"Quick."

"It's June 18th......."

"Height and weight."

He filled out Kliffman's application for him and handed it to him, leaving only his signature.

"Sign."

"Huh?"

"You want me to sign it? This is your job."

"He, he....... I'm not sure I'm ready for that......."

Riana's brow narrowed.

"Sure. Just do it. Do it. Do you want to get electrocuted or crispy?"

-fazik! fazik!

When Riana's fingertips glowed blue, Klippmann scrawled his signature in disgust.





Riana this asshole.

He knows exactly how to handle Cliffman.

You do realize that indecisive, cranky kids need to be grabbed by the scruff of the neck and dragged away, right?

No, she's just the way she is. Taking the signed application, Riana shakes her head.

"Do I need to submit this?"

"Well, that's....... Well, I don't know about that......."

"I should go."

Riana nodded at my words.

"Why not have someone come with me?"

"Right?"

-Took

Riana jumped to her feet and punched Kliffman in the shoulder.

"Hey, follow me."

"Ugh, huh?"

"I don't understand this. Are you sure you want to be electrocuted?"

"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, okay!"

Cliffman bounced to his feet, and Riana led the way, application in hand.

"I can't even do this one thing right, and it's annoying."

Riana led the way, while Kliffman stared at me.

Help!

He had a look on his face that said.

No.......

Me too....... She can't do anything about it.

Cliffman trotted reluctantly behind Riana like a cow being led to the slaughter.

After a while, Riana returned, bringing only Cliff, who looked pleased with himself.

Apparently, they had filled out an application.

"Hmm......."

"That....... Why again......?"

"First of all, you look so nerdy. Your hair, your expression, your posture, your whole demeanor."

The look on Kliffman's face at this poignant point is priceless.

Riana sat Kliffman down and started playing with his hair, trying to put it in an all-back, parting it, and so on.

That's him.......

He liked to dress up and stuff.

It was like they were going to do what they did with Ellen, only this time with Cliff. I don't care if it's a man or a woman, as long as it's a hanger, is that it?

Cliffman, of course, was flinching at Riana's touch, his heart beating faster and faster in real time.

"Hmm....... Something's missing......."

Oh dear, it looks like my mission to create a Mr. Cliffman Temple has slipped through my fingers.

"Anyway, you only trust your sister."

"Huh? Uh, uh....... Yeah....... But why would you want to be my sister......."

"Fuck it. Go throw up somewhere."

"Uh, ah, okay!"

This is what happens. Is that right?

It seems to have passed from the hands of the male Reinhardt to the female Reinhardt.

Before I could convince her otherwise, Riana started poking fun at Kliffman.

When I tried to add something, she was like, "What do you know?" and took control.

Cliffman's resentful stare made me feel a twinge of guilt, but no matter how I think about it, between a villain named Reinhardt and a villain named Liana de Granz, the latter seems more likely to make Cliffman Mr. Temple.

He actually cares a lot about his clothes, and he's probably better at taking care of his appearance than I am.

So in the end, I didn't have a say in the matter, and I figured I could just let someone more capable take over and not bother.

That wasn't the end of it. While Klippmann and Riana were freaking out, Ellen spotted Riana in the distance and approached with guns blazing.

I haven't seen him move that fast in a long time.

"Riana."

"Oh, Ellen. Why?"

"I want to buy a dress. Can you help me pick one out?"

"A dress? Suddenly?"

"Yes."

Ellen nodded.

"Me, Miss Temple, I'm going out."

"......Eh?"

Riana is stunned for a moment.

Why would she do that?

Shocked, questioning.

"Oh. Ohhhh!"

And excitement.

You now have unlimited dressing opportunities on two of your favorite hangers.

"Great! Come to my room, both of you! No, come to my mansion for the weekend, both of you! I'll have the whole zodiac boutique over!"

Cliffman on the left, Ellen on the right.

Liana de Granz is on the verge of happiness.



* * *



Riana didn't ask any questions about Klippmann and Ellen's spur-of-the-moment decision to participate.

He was excited about the idea that good things are good things, and that he was going to try this and that.

I let her do her thing. I don't know much about fashion, and my job is to confirm the winner at the elimination, and if Riana does a good job, she'll get fewer points for the elimination.

We still have a variable named Ellen.

It wouldn't be a bad idea for Ellen to be Miss Temple. Olivia and Ellen are both very talented.

Honestly, I'd be happy with a randomized talent from either of them, and most importantly, Cliff's combat talent.

But what can I say.......

Ellen and Olivia.

If you vote for one of them, the person you vote for should win.

If you vote for Ellen and Olivia wins, you end up getting nothing.

And.......

Honestly, the odds are in Olivia's favor. All considerations aside, name recognition is a different story.

However, Ellen said she only needed one vote.

So Ellen tries to leave, even though she knows she has little chance of becoming Miss Temple.

"......."

Darn.

Headaches are a dime a dozen, and they don't go away, they just get more and more. From big problems to personal relationships.

The problems will only continue to grow.



* * *



It's exam season, but the mood of first-year Royal Class has changed. And it's not just because it's exam time.

It was the new headmaster, Saviolin Tana.

"Reinhardt, Lord Tana has asked me to gather the students who wish to take swordsmanship lessons!"

An excited Ludwig arrived at the A-class dormitory. It was exam time, but he was going to give us a lesson.

"Of course you're going, right?"

"......you're not worried that this is a trial period at all?"

It's not my place to say, but I have other things to worry about and you should be studying, you son of a bitch!

At my words, Ludwig laughed and scratched his head.

"Aww, but what chance do I have of that, I don't know when you're going to quit."

You're right. Ludwig is interested in improving his skills, he has no talent or interest in studying.

"Anyway, pass it on to Class A. They're going to be teaching in the dormitory in Class B!"

Ludwig passed the torch to me and took off like a bird, heading back to his B-class dorm.

......I'm always wondering why he's so weird.

I'd rather die than suffer, after all, I'm my own worst enemy. I sighed and paced the rooms of the A-class dormitory, delivering Savior Tana's message.

I was no different than Ludwig. I'd rather take a swordsmanship lesson from Saviolin Tana than a class.



* * *



A group of people gathered in a B-class dormitory dance hall during an exam period.

In class A, it's just me and Erich.

Erich seems to be working hard these days, but I'm not sure what his accomplishments are.

Cliffman really wanted to come, but he was dragged away by Riana.

Ellen looked like she wanted to go, but she also looked like she wished Miss Temple hadn't come to see if she could talk to Riana.

In Class B, it was Scarlett, Ludwig, and Delfin Izad.

While swordsmanship isn't Delphine's main focus, she's learning, and she's curious to see what the famed Xanapelle master Xaviorin Tana has to teach her.

Saviolin Tana hasn't exactly made herself known to me since she entered the dorm. She's here for Charlotte's protection. I am here to protect Charlotte, and not to reveal myself so that I can take action.

If something happened, she'd look for me, but she didn't even acknowledge me, just nodded at my greeting and walked past.

I know it's to protect me, but it's also subtly creepy.

"Oops, sorry to ignore you.

"What to do.

"But if I pretend to know, I could get in trouble.

'Sorry.......'

Of course, the look on his face said it all.

"They did a great job of coming together in the midst of our busy schedule."

As if that would be the end of her greeting, she pulled a water lily sword from its sheath.

I was a little disappointed that Ellen, the real ace, wasn't there.

I was curious to see what Saviolin Tana would think of Ellen's performance, and it's not like today is the only time we'll get to see her.

Actually, Saviolin Tana seemed a little puzzled that Ellen wasn't here. She just didn't show it.

"I'm not very verbal, and I'm not used to teaching things. So if you want to get something from me, you'll have to learn by doing. Students who realize a lot will learn a lot, and students who don't know what they're doing wrong will learn less."

Saviolin Tana glanced at the five gathered.

"Come forward, one by one, hopefuls."

"Let me try!"

Ludwig jumped to the forefront.

"What's your name?"

"This is Ludwig from B-11!"

Saviolin Tana.

Ludwig.

After the original gate incident, the two became priests.

Saviolin Tana was a harsh and cruel teacher, and Ludwig was forced to get used to her overbearing and harsh teaching methods, even though he felt terrible about them.

She also taught Ellen, but she was more hands-on with Ludwig than with Ellen. Of course, that doesn't mean she didn't teach Ellen anything.

Ludwig and Saviolin Tana.

Although unintentional, my actions succeeded in bringing them together more than a year earlier than their original time zone.

After the Gate, things were out of control, which is why Saviolin Tana treated Ludwig so harshly, but now nothing has happened.

Can they build a softer, more moderate priestly relationship?

"Here we go!"

"You don't have to be loud."

"Yep! Got it!"

"He said I didn't have to yell."

"Yes!"

"You're at ....... Do something."

-Kagagak!

Saviolin Tana deflected Ludwig's full weight with her right hand, and in one swift motion, she brought the tip of her sword to Ludwig's throat.

"Ouch."

"Hmm......."

Saviolin Tana looked at Ludwig and shook her head.

"That sucks."

"Sorry!"

"There's nothing to apologize for. It's just the truth."

"I'll do my best!"

"......."

Saviolin Tana glares at Ludwig, who stares back.

'um.......'

'umm.......'

'Why.......'

"Hey, I don't like this.

As expected, the sound of Tana's heart was read by the viola.
