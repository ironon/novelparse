            Episode 572.





It never occurred to Ellen that her small, cute cat might be considered food by someone else.

It's unlikely that Ellen didn't know about hunger in refugee camps.

However, since the Gate incident, Ellen has been repeatedly entering and leaving the battlefield via mass teleportation.

That's why we've spent so little time in the ecliptic since the Gate incident.

He is now a member of the Allied forces.

By the look on his face, it's clear that this is the first time he's entered the refugee zone today.

This is the first time I've ever seen a body, adult or child, starved to death, not killed by a monster, but left to die of starvation.

They're not surprised because of me, they're surprised because it's too much for them to handle.

Ellen stood there for a long moment with me sitting on the bed, wondering what I was thinking.

"I'll go by myself."

Ellen patted me on the head and left the room.

Unlike Ellen, I had seen the conditions in the refugee camps firsthand, but I sensed that they were worse than before.

There would be less food to feed the army and less rations to go to the refugee camps, so hunger would only increase.

I wondered if we were in the midst of a plague or something, and I saw the occasional person who looked sick, but not from hunger.

The divine power of Tuan, the God of Purity, is needed, but the refugees hate Tuan and the Order of Als.

Maybe your priests aren't doing their job.

The question of what to eat.

It's winter there.

There will be countless people who will starve, freeze, and die of disease.

The dense population of the ecliptic has surpassed 100 million.

The number of people who die of starvation or freeze to death on the ecliptic over the course of a winter is likely to exceed 10 million units.

It's a shame, and it's hopeless.

But that's not something I can fix.

The population of the ecliptic alone is ten times that of the entire Edina Archipelago.

Edina's food situation is better than the ecliptic, but it's not exactly relaxed.

The same goes for food surpluses.

If there's enough food in Edina to feed tens of millions of refugees, there's no way to get it to the ecliptic.

I can't feed the hunger here.

What I can do.

No, I don't know if you can or not, but what you can try is to get to the end of the gate situation.

What happened next was something I would have to think about later.

Heinrich and Ellen were out on patrol, and Heinrich was the first to return to his dorm.

-Angel

"Hmm?"

He shook his head when he saw me wandering around without Ellen.

"I thought you were trying to take me to ......?"

Heinrich did not appear to be injured. There aren't many monsters in the ecliptic, and if there were, they wouldn't pose a threat to Heinrich.

It's like that.

If an orc shows up on the outskirts of the ecliptic and starts rampaging, a few dozen refugees will die in a hilarious fashion, but Heinrich can dispose of it with a wave of his hand.

"Hah......."

Heinrich looks out the window and sighs.

To get around the outskirts, he would have had to enter the refugee zone, and he would have seen the same thing that Ellen saw today.

So I couldn't help but make that face.

About two hours after Heinrich's return.

It wasn't until close to dinnertime that Ellen returned to her dorm.

He's coming back safely, of course, but I can't help but feel a little reassured.

A ballroom in the evening.

There were other students, but Ellen and Heinrich and the returning Ludwig and Detomorian were the only two sophomores.

The three researchers rarely return from the lab.

Detomorians have a bad complexion by nature.

Ellen has a bad complexion because of what happened today.

Heinrich has a bad complexion because he sees something similar to Ellen.

Ludwig works for the guard. So he's seen worse, or maybe he's done something terrible. Not surprisingly, he's in a bad mood.

So all four of us started dinner with a bad complexion.

My stomach is in knots.

Ellen paused as she scooped the scrambled eggs onto my dedicated plate.

"......."

A look of guilt flashes across my face that I can't hide.

Like thinking about what a luxury it is to keep an animal when there is so much hunger.

I was thinking that Ellen could not help but think that.

Ellen looks down at me, looking like she's going to cry.

Eventually, Ellen relieved me of the scramble, making sure she couldn't starve me, and gently stroked my hair.

It was as if the hand was telling me that I had done nothing wrong.

Ellen didn't gobble it up like she did when she came back.

You feel guilty about feeding them, so it makes sense that you feel guilty about eating.

It's hard not to realize that eating well and resting is the right thing to do for people.

It just doesn't go over well.

"How was your patrol? I was too wide open to go all the way around."

Heinrich asked.

"I didn't go too far, so I didn't have any problems. What about you?"

"Me neither. I'm kind of bummed that I didn't get to do anything, but that's probably a good thing."

"Yes."

They moved to check on the situation in the outer ecliptic.

If those two just came back from slaying a bunch of monsters, there's no reason to celebrate. That means the outlying areas are dangerous enough to be infested with monsters.

That's why it's better to do nothing at all.

"Looks like we're not the only ones who thought the same thing."

"......?"

Ellen shakes her head at Heinrich's words.

"The Alliance is in good shape, which means the Empire wants to make sure the ecliptic is safe for the winter. They must be running a large mopping-up force."

"......That's great."

Definitely.

If they can think it, so can the empire.

It cannot save people from starvation, but it is pacifying the region around the ecliptic to eliminate the threat of monsters.

Ellen and Heinrich seemed to be contemplating volunteering for an extermination mission to patrol the outskirts of the ecliptic and find and slay monsters.

Of course, Ellen thought about it and shook her head, saying she didn't think so.

Bertus wanted Ellen to rest for the winter, and he wouldn't allow it if she volunteered for a raiding mission.

Heinrich was similarly unable to participate in the lynch mob, so they decided to go their separate ways.

It never hurts to have more hands.

This can't be a bad thing, as it means that if there are any dangerous monsters running around, we can fight them off, or the ecliptic is safe.

In both cases, it seemed like they were going to try to get out to more remote areas tomorrow.

Just....... Can't we take a break?

Heinrich makes a short tongue-in-cheek comment.

"The problem is food."

What refugees are facing now is not monsters, but hunger.

A monster in a refugee camp can kill hundreds of people in an instant, but starvation slowly kills tens of millions.

Everyone knows what the real enemy is.

However, you can't kill what you can't knock down.

You can kill monsters, but you don't know how to kill hunger.

"......."

In the silence, Ludwig struggled to eat with his left hand.

The King of Cernstadt, Constantin von Schwarz, makes an inspection as the Allies enter a period of rest.

But the king's main concern was not the inspection, but the whereabouts of the two missing princes.

Louise didn't think lying to him would work.

Even the princes' own entourage is suspicious of their disappearance.

And the current King of Cernstadt, Constantin von Schwarz, had already been briefed long ago.

He would have thought about it and deduced the truth.

With only Louise and Heinrich of Schwarz's royal family left alive, I had a pretty good idea of what the vice-king would guess.

Louise didn't make excuses. It wouldn't work.

I didn't even say it was unavoidable. Because you can't rationalize it.

That's why I said it myself.

"I killed it."

I told the vice king, who wanted to know the truth about my two brothers' disappearance, that I had killed them with my own hands.

And he didn't say anything.

Louise is not a talkative person to begin with.

There was no rebuke, no condemnation, no astonishment, no fear.

Constantin von Schwarz looked into his eldest daughter's face for a long time and said only one word.

"Have you nothing more to say?"

Apologize.

Excuses.

Tears.

Grief.

Guilt.

A plea or an angry rant about it all.

When her father asked her that, she nodded.

"No, I don't."

Daughters are soft-spoken because they take after their fathers.

"Yeah, okay."

Just as a daughter's inability to speak doesn't mean she doesn't think, a father's inability to speak doesn't mean he doesn't think.

In the silence, Louise was thinking, and in the silence, Constantin von Schwarz was thinking.

They were a father and daughter who had only the necessary conversations. Just like Heinrich and Louise do now.

"Where is Heinrich?"

"We've briefly reverted to the ...... template."

He knew what that meant.

We can't help but feel for Louise, who took her son into hiding because she didn't want to start a fire.

Constantine von Schwarz did not say a word about his eldest daughter's behavior in killing his two sons.

She didn't make any excuses.

Only each other can know what the other is thinking.

There are relationships that are understood without conversation, and there are relationships that are not understood without conversation.

"Your prince is dead because of Heinrich."

The father-daughter duo fell into the latter category.

Two in the hands of a son.

Two in the hands of a mother.

Heinrich von Schwarz said that for the sake of one prince, four others had to die.

The harsh words stunned Louise into silence.

"If they hadn't all laid a hand on my son, he wouldn't be dead."

A sharp word gets a sharp answer.

The two princes who tormented the young Heinrich were burned to death at the hands of Heinrich, who awakened his psychic powers.

And the two brothers who tried to assassinate Heinrich died at the hands of Louise.

We could have left Heinrich alone.

There will be harsh words, and then there will be harsh words, and then there will be irreparable words.

But Ruiz was determined.

No matter what I was told, I was going to protect my son.

So Louise looked at the silent king.

"I thought it would be a little later, earlier."

"......Yes?"

Constantin von Schwarz's words caused Louise to panic.

"He said he thought it would be sooner."

"......."

"I would have thought you would have gotten your hands on your siblings a little earlier."

Louise never thought her father would feel that way.

Constantin von Schwarz thought it would happen someday.

The child does not know the parent.

Parents don't know their children.

Parents know their children a little better than children know their parents.

So Constantin von Schwarz saw what had to happen.

I can't take it for granted, but I can't help but think it's inevitable.

"Either you're less wise than I thought, or you trusted your siblings more."

Even without Louise's explanation, Constantin von Schwarz was predicting what had happened in the Allies.

Children's strength.

Jealousy and envy.

And stupidity.

And Louise's guilt and love for her son.

Even so, it was going to happen at some point.

"Did you love your brothers?"

"......."

Louise couldn't answer.

I couldn't say I loved it or didn't love it.

I watched my daughter shed tears of unspeakable sadness, self-loathing, and guilt, unable to make a sound.

Watching my daughter with tears streaming down her cheeks and not being able to wipe them away.

I watched my daughter shed tears she couldn't bring herself to shed in front of her son and grit her teeth in front of her father.

"Okay....... That's it....... that's it."

The father could not forgive his daughter for killing her brothers.

I had no choice but to accept the inevitable.



* * *



Whatever the real reason, an inspection was the original purpose, so Louise helped the King inspect the military in Cernstadt.

We talked about the status of the military, its strength and supply.

And after the debriefing, Constantin von Schwarz said the same thing Louise had said to Heinrich.

"Rest."

"......Yes?"

"I will take command of the army for the winter."

Just as the mother ordered the rest because of her son's prolonged fatigue, the father ordered the rest because of his daughter's prolonged fatigue.

"I will see that the Emperor is granted permission. Since you wanted to go so badly, you and Heinrich can spend the winter at the Temple."

An unexpected break.

And to spend it with my son in a place I've only dreamed of visiting.

I've been able to visit places where I wasn't even allowed to see where my son lived and grew up.

Upon hearing of the princes' disappearance, the king accepted what he had to endure and what he had to understand.

After all, the throne is a cruel place.

He thought his daughter might do such a thing, and he had to look the other way because she was supposed to be the king.

What mattered was the heir to the throne.

You'd think that now that what you thought might happen has happened, you'd want to clean up what's left.

You might have thought that there was no reason for those who remained to continue to suffer.

His behavior is not one of understanding, but of resignation.

Knowing that made her feel even more guilty.
