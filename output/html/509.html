Now that he was free of the spirits that were killing him, he regained his strength as if he had never been sick.

Everything was back to its best.

But there was silence among Edina's senior leadership.

Very few people know what happened.

Liana de Granz fooled the devil with her dogma.

But this time, the whole entourage worked together to fool the devil.

Even if they were trying to save the king, they didn't ask the king's doctor.

So even though he was doing it to save his king, he couldn't help but hold his breath as he watched.

You're furious. It's bad enough that you've been cheated again, but this time it's with all of your closest associates.

Everyone was afraid because they didn't know how the demon's anger would be expressed.

Not Harriet, not Olivia, not Irie, not Charlotte, not the Senate.

He was afraid of what Reinhardt would say about it.

But.

The demon said nothing.

Anger.

Sadness, too.

Hatred.

Resentment.

I didn't say anything.

The demon sat all day on the tallest spire in Edina, and said nothing.

What you're thinking, how you're feeling.

I don't tell anyone.

Rather, it scared everyone.

What the devil is thinking.

Reinhardt hasn't even opened his mouth to say what he's going to say about this.

Everyone held their breath and watched the demon's eyes.



* * *



The high spires of Edina.

The castle was originally built on a cliff, and the top of the tallest spire was a favorite haunt of the devil.

It's a great place to take in all the sights of Edina.

"Reinhardt......."

"Yes."

"Eat this, haven't you eaten anything today?"

Reinhardt looks at the sandwich that Harriet has brought him.

"Thanks."

The demon accepted the sandwich and took a bite.

You're not exactly starving.

It's not like I'm ignoring anyone.

It's not that I blame anyone in particular.

They just sit on top of the steeple all day.

I don't know what I'm thinking, but I've been looking down on Edina from the spire all day.

I didn't ignore anyone who tried to talk to me.

Charlotte is in charge of all things national anyway, so there's nothing Reinhardt needs to do in Edina.

So you can do this all day long and Edina will still be fine.

Herriot was fidgeting, unable to sit next to Reinhardt, but also unable to leave.

Once Reinhardt realized what had happened, he didn't blame anyone, nor did he point fingers.

I was just doing this.

Everyone was feeling guilty and afraid in that behavior.

"Pfft."

"......?"

Reinhardt is silent for a moment, then looks up at Herriot.

Herriot felt a flicker of fear in Reinhardt's gaze.

I wonder what he's trying to say now.

What anger, what rebuke, what price to pay for deception.

When Harriet is feeling her heart tighten, wanting to hear what Reinhardt has to say, but afraid not to.

"Last time I tried it, I liked it, you know, that thing. Dream manipulation."

"Oh......? Uh, yeah."

Reinhardt had a different story.

"The ability to control Airi's dreams... do you think it could be done with magic?"

"Huh? Why is that all of a sudden?"

"No, I felt like I was going to lose my mind, but it was better when I stayed with her when she slept."

It sounds totally weird.

"What if we implemented that as an artifact or something, like a dream wavelength or something. I was wondering if we could enchant it and make an artifact or something that emits an aura or something like that, so that everyone who lives within a certain area has good dreams or something like that?"

"Uh....... Huh?"

Herriot said Reinhardt could talk about this, but he doesn't think he's in a position to do so.

But without even mentioning it, he was saying something else entirely, something that could be considered trivial.

He was acting as if he'd forgotten about Ellen Artorius.

Of course, it would be pointless to lash out and get angry about something that has already happened, but Ellen is not a pointless person to Reinhard.

But out of nowhere, we're talking about an artifact about a dream.

Herriot had no idea what Reinhardt was thinking right now.

"If we could gradually plant those artifacts throughout Edina, wouldn't that help people heal from their trauma?"

"Uh, huh....... I guess so."

"I'm not saying you have to build it, just think about what it would be like if you could."

Reinhardt could only say that while munching on a sandwich.

Everyone was doing this knowing that Reinhardt would be furious.

But people were learning in real time that the scariest reprimand is no reprimand at all.

You don't know what he's thinking because he doesn't say anything, and you don't know how angry he is because he's not angry at all.

In the midst of this tension, someone had to step up.

A week after that incident.

"Your Highness."

Elise climbed the spire where Reinhard was killing time.



* * *



"Uh, hello?"

Reinhardt nodded slightly and shifted his gaze back to the city of Razak.

Eleris stares at Reinhardt's figure.

There was no anger, no sadness, no strangeness in his expression.

Eleris didn't know what to say to the silent demon.

"Your Majesty, about the last time......."

"Oh, that."

Reinhard looks at Eleris.

"Why?"

Elyse seemed to freeze in her tracks as she responded, "Whatever.

She couldn't tell if he was nonchalant, distraught, or holding back his emotions. She didn't know what to say, but eventually she had to find the words.

"Are you sure....... correct?"

As awful as it felt to ask someone who couldn't possibly be okay, she couldn't help but speak up.

Your pent-up emotions may explode.

She didn't know what to do if that happened.

"Hmm......."

The Demon King stares out across Razak in silence.

"You've said that before."

"What are you talking about......."

"I hope it's not going to be a sad relationship. It was. Me and Ellen."

"ah......."

Eleris remembered when the demon had spoken.

In the Darklands, Eleris, under an assumed name, accompanied Ellen and Reinhardt.

After learning that Ellen was the sister of Lagan Artorius, Eleris had said so as if foreseeing an ominous fate.

Son of a demon and sister of a warrior.

I had a premonition that the relationship was never going to end well.

In time, the Devil's son became the Devil, and the Hero's sister became the Heroine.

It's already a sad relationship.

Beyond sadness, it became a cruel relationship.

"I guess it was supposed to be like this."

"Yes......?"

"Whatever the reason, whatever the cause, whatever the intent."

Reinhardt can only stare down at the city of Razak.

"I think it was supposed to be like this."

Eleris couldn't understand the demon's words.

"No matter how hard I try, no matter how much I don't want to be in that situation, I feel like it was meant to be."

A warrior who fears to fight the devil has come to bear the hatred of mankind.

It's inevitable that you'll end up fighting.

"So there's no point in blaming anyone, that's just how I see it."

You can't escape this world of forced endings.

The devil wasn't really blaming anyone.

Eleris didn't understand what the demon was talking about.

The logic of which only the devil himself can understand.

These days, the Devil isn't looking out over the city of Rajak.



[Preview is enabled].



I could only replay that message, and what it showed me, over and over again.

Himself, who lost his life to Ellen.

Ellen stares down at the scene in disbelief.

Ellen stood there, staring down at Reinhardt with blank eyes.

Finish.

He holds the Voidblade with both hands, inverted, and stabs it into his chest.

Then, kneeling before the fallen demon, slowly dying.

Again and again.

Again and again.

I was just watching it over and over again.

"So anyway, tell everyone not to worry because I'm not really mad at them."

Reinhardt smiled thinly and said, "Yes.



* * *



The future that the preview shows me is like the last evil I need to suffer.

Ellen kills me, and I kill myself.

We don't know what moment that will be.

But if things continue as they are, one day I will fight Ellen and be killed by her.

Then, Ellen takes her own life.

That was the last future I was given.

I don't know what remains outside the landscape I saw. Is Edina doomed, is humanity doomed, or is both intact?

After or before the gate incident.

I don't know.

After all, the path I need to take is fixed in some way.

You won't be able to bully them into giving you back what went into Ellen. This time, she won't cooperate.

Even if I can get it, I can see a future where things twist and turn and I'm fighting Ellen in a different way.

So accept it.

Fixed future.

You must fight Ellen.

If I don't kill it, I will die, and if I die, Ellen will die.

I don't know if the Ellen I see is the Ellen who has lost herself in the desire. I don't know if she is in control of her body.

In any case, no matter how I try to avoid it, the future will find me.

So there was no real anger.

I've been exposed to so much maliciousness that I can only feel a sense of despondency that this is how it's supposed to be.

Can we change this future.

The preview is not there for my despair.

It shows that if you can change this future, change it.

Of course, in hindsight it feels like I'm just showing it to you to see my despair.

It's not hard to change the future as I see it now.

Either I die now, or Ellen dies now.

If either event occurs, that future disappears.

It's all too easy to kill yourself, so I don't see that future as absolute.

Not an absolute future, but a future that is all too easily changed.

But the easy way out is not one I'm going to take, so that future is coming.

If this future is truly unstoppable, and it's just there to fuck with me, then the fucker shouldn't have shown it to me.

The point of this is to show you that you're going to be in this situation at some point, and to get your ass in gear.

The future doesn't arrive the moment you know it.

Just like some of the futures I saw didn't happen.

This case is simple.

If I'm weak, I die, and so does Ellen.

So, I just need to be stronger than Ellen.

It just illustrates that simple fact.

I'm sure everyone was wondering why I wasn't angry, why I wasn't reprimanding anyone.

But I can't do that until I explain how I feel because I'm the only one who can understand why I'm doing this.

"You have called, Great One."

From the spires of Razak's royal castle, I heard the voice of Antrianus, who answered my call.

I was told that it was Antirrhinus who suggested that Ellen should carry my soul.

Always.

A crazy old man suggesting options that seem to be for me, but aren't for me at all.

"Are you angry with me?"

"That doesn't mean much."

I speak without looking at Antony.

"Apparently, I thought you were going to kill me."

"What good would that do?"

It's not that I'm not angry. Antony's case is special.

It's true that the heat is on.

But what's the point in being angry?

What's the point of killing Antony?

We tried to prevent a gate, but we got a gate.

If the world is like this, why shouldn't I be able to get what I want so easily?

It's not going to be easy, so it's better that way.

I guess that's a bit of a stretch, though.

And getting Ellen back.

I wonder if it's even possible.

No matter how unlikely it is.

No matter how impossible that is.

I don't think all possibilities are closed.

So, do what you can.

"I'm about to make you an offer that will be hard for you to refuse."

"Hehe....... That's interesting."

Antirrhinus, amused, began to listen to me.
