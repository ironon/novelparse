            Episode 427.





One day, my son would inherit my mission and complete the destruction of the human race if I failed to fulfill it. The feeling of despair and betrayal as he struck me in the back and snapped my fallen horns was indescribable.

Still unable to kill the mother, the son snapped my horns and chased me out of the Darklands.

With his horns cut off, the demon lost all power; he could no longer control the demons, nor could they follow him.

It wasn't until later that I realized that casting me out of the Darklands was a final act of kindness from my son to his mother, for if I had remained in the Darklands, the demons that had escaped my control would have tried to kill me.

You're a dead man walking, unable to use any of your powers, magic, or knowledge.

The pain of having my horns snapped off by a demon was worse than death, and for a long time I suffered from the pain I felt in the place of my missing horns.

Would I have come to my senses and realized my mistake.......

I was just angry and frustrated.

It was sad.

I shook with rage at the thought of losing everything I'd worked so hard for, of being just a little further, just a few steps away, only to have it all ruined at the last minute, even at the hands of my son.

I couldn't die like that.

So frustrating.

I'm so excited.

It's so unfair.

I didn't want to admit that it was all over.

He didn't know how, but he wanted revenge on the son who had brought such shame to his mother, and he wanted to fulfill his mission by reclaiming his throne.

I was looking for a way for a horned demon to build up its power.

I realized that I needed to become immortal, so I became a vampire. By becoming a vampire, I sought to become strong again by accumulating the power of other beings within myself.

He traveled between the Darklands and the lands of men, seeking the blood of the strongest demons, the strongest beasts, and the strongest humans, sometimes fighting to the death.

Rumor has it that there are those who have attained the pinnacle of vampiric power in a secluded place in the far, far north, and so the Vampire Lords sought them out, seized the power of the Lord Vampire, and thus became the Clan of Hwayo.

Since then, I have drunk the blood of countless beings.

Eat, eat, eat, eat.

I've been feeding for so long that I believe the bodies of countless beings I've piled up form mountain peaks, and the blood I've sucked flows like a river.

At some point, I had no choice but to become the Gazoo of Tuesdays.

My ancestor, Gaju, who was so sick of living that he took his own life, handed over the position of Gaju to me and said.

Isn't it time to stop killing for the sake of killing?

I could drink all the blood in the world and my thirst would not be quenched.

Ask yourself if you really want what you want," he said, and closed his eyes.

I hadn't really thought about it.

For a very long time. I realized that I hadn't thought about it.

At some point, I became an otherness, killing to kill, drinking to drink, getting stronger to get stronger.

They wander the world in search of stronger blood, but the original vengeance and purpose they sought to fulfill through it has been lost in the mists of time.

Not quite there yet.

Still, it's not enough to take on the devil.

You're still a long way from reclaiming your throne.

As I piled on the kills to get stronger and stronger, I realized that the throne of Darkland had already changed hands.

I knew then that the son who had broken my horns and driven me away had long since outlived his usefulness, and that his daughter was the next demon.

Before I knew it, I was an aimless vampire, an immortal dead man wandering the continents in search of blood.

Why the throne of the demons must be mine again.

Why the human race must end.

Why I was hoping for that.

It's all been lost in the shuffle.

In my obsession with strength, I had become a crazed vampire with nothing left but a bloodlust.

I realized too late that my vague sense of revenge and lust for the throne was long gone.

The power from the mountains of corpses and rivers of blood was in me, but I realized too late that there was nothing I wanted to do with it.

Lowly, many a tyrant has victimized his people with his misguided actions, but that doesn't mean I'm going to kill him.

As a tyrant, I sacrificed countless demons, and as a vampire, I built another mountain of corpses with my own hands.

I don't think there's anyone in the world who has done more killing than me.

It wasn't atonement, but it had lost its meaning, and I no longer engaged in the killing.

After wandering the world in search of blood, I wandered the world once again in search of nothingness.

I had lost my purpose and had no wind, so I moved through the world like a disoriented wind, blowing wherever my feet took me.

Sometimes in the Darklands, sometimes in the land of men.

Despite the fact that they had been around for a very long time, this was the first time I had seen them in action.

To me, demons were tools and humans were enemies.

To me, as a vampire, all beings were just ingredients for strength.

It was only after I lost all cravings that I was able to look at the beings in the world without a purpose.

The way humans live.

Demons in action.

I watched them for no purpose or reason, just because they were there.

Despite having traveled across countless lands and drunk the blood of countless beings, it was as if I was seeing countless sights for the first time.

One day we rode over mountain ranges, one day we walked through snowfields, one day we traveled through deserts, straits, and jungles, and we saw so many ways of being and so many modes of existence.

It's about seeing those lives where everyone seems to be the same and living differently.

I couldn't help but realize how much I had sinned and how many lives I had destroyed.

It has shattered and destroyed immeasurable lives and foundations as it grinds what could have been more beautiful, everything that is enough as it is, into a sack of unfulfilled longing.

I'm guilty of learning too late how to love something.

It's an ugly, cowardly vampire who only realizes that something was worth loving and caring for after it's gone.

So that's what I thought.

The mountain of sins is too great, and the day will never come when it will be covered with goodness.

At least.......

Let's not pile on the sins.

It was still a vague life.

He doesn't suck blood anymore, just wanders the world vaguely, observing things, trying to help someone when he can, but being careful not to be too presumptuous.

There's no such thing as deserving to be good.

The best I could do was to give someone a very small, hard to call it good, amount of sympathy.

It was a period of apathy and contemplation.

One day, in the midst of those long, long, long, long days of still being vaguely aware, I heard it.

War between the Darklands and humanity is at hand.

I felt confused for the first time in a long time.

I didn't think there was a role for me, a forgotten demon, an old vampire, to play in a war that was sure to leave many dead.

However.

There was a certain sense of obligation.

A demon who once blighted the Darklands with his tyranny.

A man-hating demon who wanted the end of humanity.

It's a very old root, but as an archetype.

I felt a certain obligation to watch that war, even if I couldn't play a big role in it.

It's not like there wasn't a bond to the blood of the Archdemon that would have been diluted and lost.

I felt it was my duty to at least hold the hand of a distant descendant, even if I couldn't help them as much as I could.

So I sought out Valier and got under his wing.

I wanted the war to end without too much blood being spilled. I thought that no matter who wins, there will be blood, and the only good in war is that it ends quickly.

As I thought, I was in an unremarkable role, far removed from the war and watching it unfold from afar.

And....... Toward the end of the war.

A day when the war had already ended in a faraway land.

A boy walked through the door of my store.

When I realized the boy was a degradation.

I'm.......

I knew in my gut that I had a certain destiny.

When she's finished, she looks at me.

In a place where a demon would never appear, Eleris faced me.

What was going through Elise's mind in that moment?

When the fallen Demon King of the Darklands, unwilling to take on any role, was swept into the arms of his most distant and final descendant.

Eleris must have felt a certain intense sense of destiny that she could not remain a bystander on the outskirts of events.

"The rest of the story is....... as you know."

Eleris is an ancient, long-forgotten demon.

Ancient Valyri might have known that Eleris was a Lord Vampire, but not that she was an ancient demon.

Up until this point, all of Eleris' actions made sense.

I wondered if the motherly attitude and the way she treated me was actually coming from her heart.

Ancient Bali would have already had an absolute position as a demon king.

But I'm clumsy, I've lost my memory, and I don't have any real powers, so she's going to be worried about what I do, and I'm going to be worried about getting hurt or killed.

It's unlikely that Elyse, a tyrant, would have been a good parent.

So maybe he was trying to give me some kind of affection that he didn't have for his own children at the time.

When I was wondering who Eleris was, I thought maybe she looked like my mother, and it turns out she did.

Archdemon turned vampire.

That was her true self.

They may have lost all of their powers, but they are still Archdemons at heart.

Therefore, he stood by the side of the Demon King to see the end of the Archdemon's world, or at least its victory.

"I've been wondering about this for a while."

"Yes, degradation."

I wonder if I should call her something else now that I know she's my ancestor, but she still calls me Jaehae, so I don't think I need to clean up the nomenclature.

"Doesn't that mean she had a husband?"

"Ah."

I've been wondering about this for a while now.

"If there are so few Archdemons, how is the maintenance of the species going to work?"

At the moment, I'm the only pure-blooded Archdemon in the game, although I'd include Elise and Charlotte in that broad category.

Was Eleris married to another Archdemon?

Did the numbers just go down and down and down and down?

Elise stares at me as if I've asked her a question.

"Archdemons are all races and their....... um......."

"I get what you're saying, no more."

"Yes....... Of course, we don't really have any information about where it is possible....... universally....... and archedemons are very difficult to see their descendants......."

I could tell by the look on Elise's face that she knew what I meant.

The archetype is a .

The one that does everything.

Uh.......

I guess so.

I don't know why, but.......

It's not even clear where to start.

It's too scary.

I'm just scared!

I'd rather not even know who Elise's husband was!

I guess that's why Elise and the others haven't said anything about my crush until now.......

"And so, with each generation, the blood of the Archdemon grows thinner and thinner."

I finally understand why my Demon Domination ability is so terrible.

We walk down into the basement of the demon castle.

"When I heard that the Lord was trying to prevent a great tragedy from happening in the future....... I wondered, presumptuously, if atonement was possible."

I told all my secrets only to Elise.

That the Gate is going to happen in the future, that it's going to be a great tragedy for all beings in the world, and that you want to stop it.

That's why I've been working on finding Akasha.

"Of course, nothing can remove the mountain of sin I've built, but....... But if I could, if I could do something to help prevent future tragedies. I wondered if I could lighten the weight of the killing and sin that I've accumulated, just a little bit, just a little bit....... I dared to think that......."

Eleris wants atonement, but she knows it's a luxury and an ugly thing to ask for.

Nevertheless, Eleris is willing to cooperate with him if it means that helping me will absolve her of some of her sins.

In a war, you'd be afraid to take anyone's side, but this is about saving everyone.

So she hopes I'm sincere, and she's helping me.

"Degraded......."

"Uh."

"Regardless of how this turns out, I consider myself fortunate to have met you, and I believe it's my good fortune, and your good fortune, that you wandered through a zodiac full of humans and found me....... That's what I believe."

May it be our mutual good fortune that we met.

At her words, which I believe and hope are true, I continue down the stairs, supporting her.

"Maybe it's not luck that we met."

"......."

I put a little more strength into the arm that supports Elyse.

It all started when Elise and I bumped into each other at a shop in the ecliptic.

If I hadn't met Eleris, I might have wandered the streets of the ecliptic and lived as a beggar, or been found out and hung for being a demon.

If I hadn't met Eleris, I would never have entered the Temple, and none of this would have even begun.

I wonder if me and Eleris could be lucky enough to meet.

I wonder if I'll be remembered that way.

I don't know.

Nevertheless.

"I'm confident that even if it wasn't luck, I wouldn't regret it."

I don't regret any of this.

"......."

At my words, tears formed in the corners of Eleris's eyes.



* * *



We soon arrived at the underground bunker of the Demon Castle.

It was clear that we had arrived ahead of Antirrhinus and Akrich.

Eleris was now recovered enough to see how far she had come.

"If breaking through the Quantum Maze is the same as getting here, can they break through the Labyrinth and get here?"

"I'm not sure about that."

I'm not sure if only archedemons can get there.

The important thing is that after me and Charlotte, Elise can enter this place. Charlotte, with her half-soul, can come here, so it's clear that Archdemons who have been turned into vampires can also enter this place.

Eleris and I headed to the library.

As Dwyn, he coveted the spellbook that Charlotte had smuggled out of the city, so he went on a murderous rampage through the palace and made his way to Ritchie's tomb.

So now that Antirrhinus had betrayed him, he would soon find a way to get there.

You must retrieve or burn the spellbook before doing so.

"But it's a little....... to burn. ......."

"I'm afraid I can't retrieve it, as I'm a mage myself....... We don't know what will happen to it when Akasha is finished, so we'll have to wait until then......."

Eleris and I stood in front of the library and sighed.

"Maybe we should burn the magic Akrich used, because it's dangerous to have it here."

"When you think about it, yes......."

I knew magic was powerful, but just thinking about what would have happened if that meteor had struck the earth was mind-boggling.

Of course, it's even more ridiculous that Herriot stopped it.

Magic is dangerous in its own right, and that level of magic is better left out of the world.

Such a spellbook might be lying dormant in this library somewhere, and it might be better to burn it than to secure it.

I stared at the library for a while, and a title caught my eye.



[Understanding the operation structure of meteor clusters through astronomical observations and the opening of portals through orbital calculations].



It was an incredibly thick book with a pretty long title.

What it is.

This.

I'm not sure, but is it just me or does this feel a bit like that magic?

I pulled out the chunky book.

"Lower, here......."

Elise had found something, too, and pulled a book from somewhere.

That's what it said in the book Elise was holding.



[Understanding the operation structure of meteor clusters through astronomical observations and the opening of portals through orbital calculations].



Elyse was staring blankly at the grimoire I was holding.

"I think it's the same book, but......."

"......Yes."

We picked up the exact same book from completely different bookshelves.

A strange chill ran down my spine.

Charlotte had recently removed many of the spellbooks from here, and she had seen the stacks of books in Lothar Dwyn's house.

I saw the magnitude of the problem clearly.

So, a bookshelf or two here should be empty.

"Why....... bookshelves are all......."

But.

Every bookshelf in my line of sight was filled to the brim, with no room for anything else.



* * *



My mind raced with all the experiences I'd had.

The same book in my and Eleris' hands. It's probably a spellbook for summoning meteors.

When I first discovered this bunker with Charlotte and Tana. I wanted to see if there was any magic in this library that could improve Charlotte's condition. For example, if there was any magic that dealt with spirits.

I was able to find a book on seduction right away.

The second time I came here with Elise and Lucinil, I looked to see if there were any other copies of The Art of Marriage to show Lucinil.

I went straight for the demonic language version of the art of engagement.

Eleris quickly found the spellbook that designed the labyrinth, the Quantum Maze, and said it must be here.

And now.

I tried to find out if there was a similar spellbook for summoning meteors, and I quickly found it.

This book is about.

Strangely, there's a lot of magic.

Oddly enough.

If.

No way.

I.

Have I been mistaken all this time?

Elise and I stared at each other in disbelief.

I turn my attention to one of the bookshelves in the library.

Is there some kind of magic book on fireballs?

As I turned my gaze elsewhere, I noticed a book tucked in there.



[Understanding and Applying Fire System Basic Destruction Magic - Fireball].



There was a spellbook for fireballs, though it was relatively thin compared to other spellbooks.

"The books on this shelf, they're changing in real time."

"Yes....... Obviously......."

When I go to look for a spellbook, it's on the shelf at some point.

So I didn't waste any time finding it.

Both Elise and I are getting a little white in the face.

I've never wanted more.

It would be in the hands of others.

That's what I thought, so I didn't ask. I didn't think there would be any information about it here.

But.

Now I want to know.

No, this bookshelf will tell you.

What is Akasha? Is there a magic book that explains Akasha?

Look away once more.

But none of the books jumped out at me.

Is there any documentation on what Akasha is?

No, the keyword is wrong?

Could there be other books, not just spellbooks?

Because anything else is good.

Something written about Akasha, something that doesn't have to be a book about magic.

Is there?

When I turned my attention back to the book, it caught my eye.

A red leather-bound notebook-like thing caught my eye.

I pulled out a book, but it didn't have a title.

I opened the book.

When I saw the first page, I couldn't help but gasp.



[My son, never, never use akasha for destruction].



That one sentence.

Instead of a bunch of complicated theories and explanations, that sentence explained everything to me.

"Elise......."

"Yes....... Degraded."

I was looking for Akasha, not realizing that she was already in my grasp.

Akasha is an artifact.

And I was assuming that artifacts would be things.

Not a thing.

"Maybe....... This bookcase here, no....... not just the bookshelf, but......."

I look around the library.

"This space....... itself....... that is Akasha....... like......."

Akasha was a space.
