Detomorian stared at the door of the warehouse where the three visitors had disappeared.

"Origins have already been made.

Dettomorian knew that the sacrifices he had made for so long had already touched something.

It's a ritual for peace.

But Dettomorian does not know if it has touched a power that has the power to truly bring peace.

And while the ending may be peaceful, the process is not.

If you have touched a dark power, peace will come through a dark process.

If you have touched the power of good, peace will come through the process of good.

If you have a weak origin and are in touch with a weak power, you will not be able to bring peace.

The shaman knows neither the process nor the conclusion.

It's something that shamans have been doing since ancient times, raising sacrifices and performing rituals in hopes of something.

Dettomorian recalls the abyss he felt with Ellen Artorius.

How can we be sure that it's not a recalculation that was influenced by the origin?

It's entirely possible that what was created was touched by the influence of the origins, and then turned around and found its way to the warrior.

We don't know how Detomorian's sacrifice will affect the world, and whatever happens, it won't be strange.

The unusually large, naturally occurring collection of spirits that possess Ellen may or may not be the product of a Dethomorian ritual.

The shaman knows nothing, and can be sure of nothing.

However, here's hoping.

The Detomorian slowly gets to his feet and begins to rearrange the seconds.

Origins have already been done.

Detomorian saw something that might be the result.

So let's move on to the next origin.

More intuitive and clearer origins.

"......."

Prayers for lost souls.

A prayer that this money doesn't get any bigger.

One of the most common roles, and one of the most important, given to shamans since time immemorial, in ancient times.

Start the soul.

"One hundred....... authorized."

The best and brightest of Edina's elite.

Mages of the Vampire Council.

Paladins and priests of the Holy Order.

And a handful of powerful demons.

No more, no less, a hundred in total.

A hundred and five, if you count the direct squad I personally lead.

Divide into five units of twenty people each.

Lord Vampires serve as captains of each unit.

And a squad directly under the Demon King, including myself, who I will personally carry with me.

My immediate squad of five: myself, Liana de Grants, Herriot de Saint-Ouen, Airi, and Olivia Ranze.

Unit 1, Elise.

Unit 2, Lucinil.

Unit 3, Lerouen.

Unit 4, Galarsh.

Unit 5, Antirrhinus.

Archmages with maneuver initiative are in charge of each unit.

Five Vampire Lords who can use mass teleport, one per unit.

We will move separately, unit by unit, to clear a path for the Allies.

"We have one rule. If you encounter Allied forces, never engage."

It is very likely to cause unnecessary conflicts.

Our enemies are the monsters of the Gate. If we clash unnecessarily and reduce our forces, we will only bring bad things to each other.

"Also, when engaging the monsters, there is no need to overpower them. Remember, our goal is never annihilation."

The last thing we need is for our side to bleed out while we're trying to secure a path of advance. We don't have to do everything.

Our purpose is not to destroy the gate on behalf of the Allies, but to help them get to the gate faster. The difference in power between humanity and us is still obvious.

I wanted to get the gate situation wrapped up a little quicker.

In order to set the world back on track.

We don't know what the ending is that we need to reach.

Now, it's time to get to the ending.



* * *



A huge army is a huge consumer group in itself.

It's going to take a lot of mass adoption.

In the original Demon War, humanity's armies used warp gates to conduct massive supply runs.

However, warp gates are no longer available, and the continent is overrun with monsters making it impossible to maintain supply routes, so most resource transportation must rely on the mass teleportation of the Archmages.

Humanity's ability to rely solely on mass teleportation for supply is low, but it inevitably faces limitations the longer the army is deployed.

So if we don't end the war soon, there's a chance that humanity's last army will starve to death, not because it's fighting monsters, but because it's starving itself.

So in order to end the war quickly, this expedition must end quickly.

So we become their vanguard, unbeknownst to even the Allies, and we sweep their path first. The Allies will realize they have a vanguard they don't know about.

And Bertus and other senior Allied commanders will soon realize it's us.

It is foolish to fight among ourselves, and commanders will try to avoid conflict as much as possible.

Of course, it's too complacent to think that there won't be soldiers or knights charging at me.

Therefore, you should avoid contact as much as possible.

And another one.

We need information about our allies.

"Be careful, Sarkegar."

"Yes, Your Highness."

Sarkegar bows his head.

As always, Sarkegar will infiltrate the garrison and provide us with a map of the Alliance's route and details of their operations.

You could probably get in touch with Bertus directly, but that's risky.

The danger is to Bertus, not me.

If that gets into someone's ears, things get serious.

Also, Bertus is not in direct command of this army and is in the ecliptic during peacetime, so our information will be slow to arrive.

So, it's better to let the enemy remain the enemy.

As always, Sarkegar, who specializes in undercover work, will be able to relay information from the Allies to us.

Spy to help your opponent, not to hinder them.

I don't even know what's what anymore, aside from the fact that my main audience has been converted.

-Kurrrrrr

We all watched as Sarkegar transformed into a hawk and soared into the sky.

"Okay, let's get started."

We have now left Edina and arrived on the continent.

We'll return to Edina for maintenance from time to time, but we'll be spending a lot of time in the field.

Until the gate event is completely over.

It was going to be a long fight.



* * *



The Allies also have a vanguard.

We don't know much about them yet, but they'll probably have a vanguard of very powerful fighters like Savior Tana and Ellen.

It would be a force that could react quickly in an emergency and would emphasize mobility, both in and out.

We will operate from a position slightly ahead of the Allied vanguard, as encountering that vanguard could cause us some headaches.

In terms of absolute troop numbers, the Allies are vastly outnumbered, so we don't have to kill every monster in our path.

If we can handle it, it will significantly reduce the amount of work the Allied vanguard has to do.

Don't overdo it.

The army of five spreads out in their assigned direction, slaying the monsters.

Then, the five of us, led by myself, go even deeper.

The city currently targeted by the Alliance is Rahstran, a large city in the northwestern part of the continent.

But before you get there, you'll have to pass through many small and medium-sized cities, including border crossings.

The Gate Crisis ends when all warp gates in the doomed territories of the Empire's third-largest empire, Ryzeln, are destroyed.

It was too much territory to handle, and the Empire had originally planned for it to be the last restoration point when Ryzeln fell.

As such, the warp gates in all of Regeln's territories were completely untouched.

It's about restoring all of a country's territory after it's been taken over by monsters.

Lahstran was the largest of the cities on the border of Ryzeln.

There are a total of seven warp gates in the city.

But monsters also come out of the gates of small and medium-sized cities that you have to pass through to get to them.

In other words, small and medium-sized cities are passing points, and large cities are the main targets.

"If the outlying areas are like this......."

"So......."

While other units were executing their missions, we were reconnoitering points far ahead of them.

A point so far ahead that nothing we do here will affect the Allied vanguard or our own troops.

The vanguard of the vanguard of the vanguard.

I stared blankly at the monsters flooding the Riseln borderlands, a border post with, at best, one small warp gate.

The distance is long, and we have the high ground, cloaked in Herriot's stealth spell, watching the situation unfold.

-koooooooooooo!

-Grrrrr!

Flying monsters roamed the fields and ruined cities, as well as monsters that overrun the land.

The number is almost unfathomable.

And there will be more and more of them the further in you go.

Me, Harriet, Olivia, Airi, and Riana.

The five of us have a bit more scope for what we can do.

"Let's try them one by one, see what works best. If we can take out a small town by ourselves, why not?"

I look at Riana.

She can summon lightning storms. And Riana's ability to kill in a wide area is unmatched among us. You can think of an entire continent and there's no one like her.

Even the magic of the Lord Vampires can't match Riana's destructive power.

But Riana has awakened new powers, and the breadth of her abilities is unlike anything we've seen before.

Weather changes.

It changes the weather on a regional scale.

Literally, it's a superpower that reaches beyond the horizon of your vision, and then beyond that horizon.

Also, psychic powers are not manifested through the expenditure of energy called magic.

"Whoa......."

Riana, her expression calm, stares at the monsters raging around her.

You've already seen what you can do.

It's not just storms, it's not just tornadoes.

After taking a depressant, Riana begins to manifest her powers with a depressed but confident look in her eyes.

"It's going to get a little, cold."

It's only October.

It's too early for winter.

But the clear blue sky soon gives way to clouds, and the air changes.

Before we knew it, white steam was coming out of all of our mouths.

The wind is blowing.

-Heyyyyyy!

The wind soon becomes a fierce gust.

Gradually, the wind swirls in, mixing with the flurries, and soon it's a blizzard that you can't even see coming.

"Nor....... No......."

Herriot's eyes widened, his mouth hanging open in disbelief as he watched.

Large-scale weather events.

A blizzard is brewing.

-Kaahhhhhhhh!

-delete!

Flying monsters crash as their wings snap and break due to sudden weather changes and gusts of wind.

The wind blows the flying monsters down.

But it's not real.

Riana mumbles to herself in the harsh gusts of wind, her face stony.

"Let's see how many of them don't freeze to death."

Freezing to death monsters that normally wouldn't exist in the cold.

That's the real power of this blizzard.
