            Episode 322.





Sarkegar joined the fray, transforming into the form of one of the paladins, and stabbed Leviathan Lance in the back, pretending to join him.

It stabbed him right through the heart from the back.

Critical wound.

But then I saw something even more alarming ensue.

"K......breathe!"

-Quack!

Levereer Ranze shrugged off Sarkegar, who had pierced his heart with a divine force that was too much for him to comprehend. Sarkegar, who was no match for the divine power, bounced off into the distance and slowly picked himself up with a grunt.

He brings his hand to his own heart, which is throbbing with lifeblood.

-Woof

The wound is healing.

Whether it was a regenerated heart or a trickle of blood from the corner of his mouth, Reverie Ranze was coming back to life.

"Are you crazy....... Are you even human?"

"Devil. What are you talking about?"

The iron-faced Leviathan wipes his mouth, spitting out a handful of blood.

"This is human."

Leviathan Lance, mending his shattered heart and ready to fight once more, looks at me and says, "You're right.

"God accepts my faith and makes the impossible possible, which is only possible for humans. It is possible because the Most High loves human beings."

Levereer Lance seemed to think that divine power was the sole prerogative of humans.

"So it is my duty, my karma, to retrieve the holy relics from unholy beings like you as soon as possible. And a way to repay the love of the gods."

Leviathan's fanaticism was different from Radia's.

Radia Schmidt's fanaticism was fierce, but Leverier Ranze's was refined madness.

A cold fanaticism, so well chiseled and honed that there is no excitement, no nervousness, no anger. Leviathan sees Sarkegar disguised as a paladin, swept away by a torrent of divine power and now rising again.

"What a lowly servant you have, wearing the skin of another being."

"......."

I thought the strength of the Leviathan would be overwhelming.

But I didn't expect it to be this bad. Its heart is pierced and it recovers. That's a creature you can't kill unless you blow its head off.

Now I'm not sure it's even possible for that thing to run out of stamina under a hail of bullets.

That would mean joining me, Sarkegaard, and Loyaar, but is that still a possibility?

Paladin's Nastiness.

I was realizing it in the most unpleasant way possible.

They strengthen their bodies, defend themselves with protection, channel divine power into their swords, and even recover from injuries that should have killed them.

If that's not a zombie, I don't know what is.

Not all paladins are like this, but Leviathan Rancher was the pinnacle of paladins who fulfilled all of the aforementioned criteria.

Reverie Rancher comes out again and begins to attack Sarkhegar.

-Thump! Quack! Quack!

"Boom!"

The monsters are me and Sarkegar.

We were only concerned with dodging the onslaught, like a beast on the rampage.

-Crack!

Knowing that Sarkegar's attack could penetrate his defenses, Leverrier Lance did not allow the raid.

Sarkegar's blades, which he creates by transforming parts of his body, are able to pierce Leviathan's defenses.

However, it didn't make any difference if the attack was successful.

-Woof!

They never take critical hits, and if they do, they bounce back quickly.

I couldn't even begin to fathom the extent of his divine power.

The only way to win was in the long game, and I didn't know if I could survive the attack of Levi Lance until we got to the long game.

"Deterioration, you must also consider dodging!"

Sarkegar's shouts pierced my ears.

Yes.

We could end the mess and retreat. I know it's definitely a time to consider that.

I succeeded in rescuing Olivia and Adriana, and I did it in Valerie's name.

But the result is that Adriana and Olivia are in danger again.

As a result, it's clear that some people will doubt that the demons saved Adriana and Olivia. They don't know anything about it, but their misunderstanding and suspicions could lead to a much worse outcome.

Or maybe Leviathan will turn a blind eye to this and try to manipulate Olivia again.

If you don't kill Leviathan Rancher here and now, you'll have done nothing today.

"No, one of us has to die today, whether it's him or me."

So.

Don't back down.

"You think you're going to win. Demon."

Levereer Ranze looks at me thoughtfully.

"Okay. I'm not going to die here. I'll kill you, and I'll live."

"What makes you so sure of that?"

Like the fanaticism of Leviathan.

Such fanaticism exists in me too.

"It's just the way it is. This world."

It's a miracle that always seems to happen in my favor.

No wonder.

Self-implied?

Words?

I don't know about that.

It's just a fact, whether you believe it or not.

My second life is bees.

My punishment shouldn't be to be slaughtered by Levereer Lance in this place.

More.

There will be a bigger punishment.

I'll have to endure some more.

There will be more sorrow to come, more pain to be prepared.

If this is what gets me killed, barring a miracle.

I will be disappointed that my punishment is only this much.

"There are too many things in store for me to die."

You won't kill me until I've tasted it all.

Even if in the midst of it all, I get crushed or trampled or driven insane or killed.

Even if you can get through it all and find happiness.

It's just not there yet.

"Even if the Great Gods descended on this spot and tried to kill me, I would not die. Leviathan."

It's not a belief, it's not an insinuation, it's just a fact, and with that certainty, a different light shone in Levereer Ranze's eyes.

"Your blasphemy has crossed the line, demon."

Aversion.

A fanatic faces another fanatic and feels disgust. What I feel for him, he now feels.

I'm not going to die yet, because the deck is still stacked against me.

I will not allow Olivia to force her grief anymore.

I won't make Olivia go back to a life where she can't even wonder what it means to be herself under the shackles of sainthood.

To Adriana, to Olivia.

I'm really going to lift you up from the pit of God and faith and belief.

Every place we live, every area of human existence, is a shithole for its own reasons.

To recognize that the gutter isn't the only thing that exists.

I will set them both free.

I want you to live a life of deliberation and choice, of adapting and succumbing to what's forced upon you, not choosing to live a life of agony.

Adriana, Olivia.

Let's give them freedom in the truest sense of the word.

"I."

"Null."

"Kill."

I make the creepiest resolution I've ever made.

Leviathan mended his sword at my words.

I'm not saying that's even possible.

He seemed to sense something different in my demeanor.

It's happening again.

Miracles.

Come to me.

You still want a lot from me.

I have a lot of work to do.

Are you sending me up to drop me?

It's not all up yet.

A miracle of such magnitude that I can take the life of Leviathan Lance, an enemy I can never defeat at my current level.

Want.

Prepare for a miracle.

Anger.

To burn the fuel called anger, to produce the results called miracles.

I should be outraged.

It was always my will that pushed me beyond my practical limits.

Levereer Ranze is disgusted with me. As if he doesn't even want to talk anymore, he prepares to attack once more.

"Die, devil!"

-Carded!

A shockwave of earth-shattering force exploded with a single swipe of Leviathan's blade. I narrowly dodge the blow, but I'm forced to roll several times across the ground. Sarkegar fired as well, but he was only able to deal a few scratches, and the iron wall that was Reverie Ranze stood firm.

It's an iron wall that can be knocked down and rebuilt.

A blue and white light begins to focus from his sword.

Explosive bursts of magic and holy power. As Saviolin Tana showed me, mages aren't the only ones capable of AoE attacks. She would have killed me in a heartbeat and fled the area.

He prepares for the big one.

Though Tiamata is the source of my divine power, I cannot draw it from within myself.

Under limited conditions, I can harness the power of Tiamata.

Reverie Ranze, paladin of Tuan.

Tiamata, the holy relic of Tuan.

In the end, we're using the same kind of force, and I'm getting pushed out of the way.

It's an even match, so as long as I'm using the same class of power, I'm going to lose the power battle.

Whether he's a fallen priest or a crazed fanatic, the time and experience he's accumulated can't be faked.

"Fade away with the light."

That's what war heroes do when they return victorious from the Great Demon War.

You have to jump through the hoops of time that he's built up that can only be real.

He's a maniac who won't die unless you blow his head off.

Then, in the end, I have to rely on my own strength.

Anger.

And.

Faith (自己暗示) and words (言靈).

And the destiny that will be given to me.

It hasn't come yet, so I won't die.

A miracle that can kill this monster.

I know what it is.

As he prepares to fight, I grab my tiara with both hands.

While you can't hold it, you can't force it.

Say.

With determination and anger.

"Tiamata."

As he struck, a storm of physical and divine power threatened to engulf me.

Toward Tiamata, who unleashes boiling holy power in all directions.

command.

"Be a magic sword."

-Kurung!

"!"

The white light that burned in Tiamata became a burning darkness.

To kill an infinitely regenerating monster with Tuan's power, of course.

It's a no-brainer.

You need to be the antithesis of that.

-Currrrr!

It doesn't end with the burning. I walk through it, shrouded in darkness, with waves of light pouring over me.

"You......! What have you done to Tiamata!"

Toward the horrified cries of the Leviathan, he leaps.

I was right.

He can't defeat Leviathan with the same force, so he summons the opposite force, and breaks through with the opposite force.

With opposing forces, you can break through his ironclad defenses and cut him off at the knees.

You only get one chance.

Cut off his breath before he can figure out what's going on.

Through the rushing light.

Shrouded in a darkness that light could not penetrate, I quickly reached the sight of the astonished Leviathan.

I know that in a single moment, life and death are twisted, history is reversed.

The difference between life and death is a matter of seconds.

Retirement.



[Use 1,000 achievement points].



And.

Shielded by my demonic powers, I bite back my greatsword in response, shouting at the Leviathan as he tries to stab me.

Words.

"Stop!"

"Boom! This....... This is......!"

One step.

Takeaway.

It can be the difference between life and death.

Toward Reverie Ranze, whose movement is temporarily blocked by my words.

-POOF!

"K......!"

I succeeded in plunging the magic sword Tiamata into its heart.



* * *



Transformed Tiamata into a magic sword.

That was the miracle I was hoping for.

He then used the power of the spirit to reinforce the power of his words, blocking Leviathan's movements at the crucial moment.

As a result.

Leverier Lance was mortally wounded.

This time it was truly a fatal wound.

"Crack, crack....... Kkkk!"

He grasped the magic sword Tiamata, which was plunged into his heart, only to spit out blood.

Already, the paladins were growing weaker by the hour. When they had had enough, they fled when they saw Leviathan Lance on his knees with his heart pierced.

You'd rather live to tell the tale than fight a losing battle.

"¯....... 큭....... 컥......."

"That sucks."

Even after his heart was pierced by a magic sword, Levereer Ranze did not die easily.

Judging by the clusters of white light all over his body, it was clear that he was holding on to the rope as tightly as he could with his divine power.

You can still use Tuan's power, albeit faintly, even if you've been struck by the full force of Shangguan.

I didn't expect it to be such a monster.

"Uh......that....... 게....... 티....... Tiamata......が......."

But even fighting a demonic force that erodes your entire body would be a challenge.

From the same being, but opposing forces.

Leviathan Lance could survive Sarkegar's attack, but he could not withstand the unholy power that flowed through the sword Tiamata.

It's just hanging on for dear life by the skin of its teeth.

I stare down at Reverie Ranze, kneeling before me, unable to move a finger as he attempts to pull the blade from his heart.

As I watched the end of Leviathan Lance, Loyar, in the form of Lycanthrope, approached me.

"Degradation. I'll track down the fleeing paladins."

"Good. Go with Sarkegar."

Sarkeghar was a bit horrified to see me fight with a holy sword turned into a magic sword, but he didn't lose sight of the task at hand.

"Don't miss a beat. No one must know I was carrying a tiara."

"Yes."

"Yes, degradation."

Technically, Olivia shouldn't have seen the demon with the holy sword. Sarkhegar would have dropped her off at a distance. There is no way Olivia could have seen this.

"Who are you....... Who are you......."

Leviathan mumbles to himself, the corner of his mouth bleeding.

"The Devil."

"Why are you calling me....... No....... Why did you attack us....... Did you attack....... Why did you....... Why did you kill Olivia......."

It wasn't until he was on his deathbed that Leverier Ranze seemed to have doubts.

Why the man who claims to be the Devil saved Olivia and Adriana. What the hell is this about Miss Temple.

He speaks in a dying voice.

"Let us cooperate...... Demon King......."

"......what?"

Leviathan speaks quietly in a dying voice.

"You are....... You want to rebuild the Demon World....... Not....... Then....... the division of the empire will benefit you....... will help you....... If we work together....... a common purpose....... For you too....... It would be an offer you could not refuse......."

I couldn't help but laugh at that.

"If you're going to say something like that, you should have said it sooner."

We're not talking about compromise until you're dead.

"I mean, it's like he's begging for his life."

"You too....... You will need me......."

If I had said this in my right mind, it would have seemed like a fanaticism that would betray men for the sake of the kingdom of God.

But with his life on the line, Leverier Lancet's words were merely a struggle.

He's throwing it all away now, in the middle of a crisis.

"Unchaste in the sense that they beg for their lives from their enemies because their lives are at stake."

"It's not that you're not willing to do whatever it takes to get there, but your intentions aren't pure because your means change depending on the situation."

"Leviathan Lance, you are disqualified in too many ways to serve Tuan."

At my words, Leviathan stares at me with dying eyes.

"You....... Really, you think you're the champion of Tuan......."

"So, you don't think so?"

Levereer Ranze looks up at me with difficulty.

He looks me in the eye.

"Such and such...... is......."

As if he's trying to find something in my eyes that he's lost.

"Yeah....... The Champion of Tuan was essentially....... to punish humans."

Champion of Tuan.

They were originally human hunters, not demons or the undead.

They have been in charge of slaying fallen warlocks and cultists for generations, and the last champion of Tuan before me was also killed fighting the cultists.

Tuan's champions are not demons or undead by nature, but human slayers.

"The Demon King is the champion of Tuan's....... In fact....... Maybe it's not so strange....... I don't know......."

He looks up at me.

Only at the point of death did he accept that I was the champion of Tuan.

His defeat has convinced him of everything, and he believes that his defeat is Tuan's will.

God is right.

Therefore, I die because God has forsaken me.

As it turns out, I was wrong.

His fanaticism was steadfast even in the face of death.

Even Tiamata, who had been transformed into a magic sword, seemed to have no choice but to accept it in the face of death.

If Tuan was truly on his side, he wouldn't have lost.

For all the questions he had for me, he finally had to admit that I was the champion of Tuan.

I pulled the Tiamata out of his heart and pointed it at the kneeling Leviathan's throat.

He says.

"I, I believed I was pure."

It was a plea, but it wasn't a plea.

It is the Champion of Tuan with the Tiamata who has come to kill the paladin who serves the God of Purity, and nothing else.

That's why the last excuse is that you believed you were pure.

He may have been truly innocent.

You may have believed that your definition was the right one.

That's why he leaves an excuse as his last will and testament.

-Scissors!

I slammed the tiamaata from top to bottom, completely taking the breath out of Leviathan.

The life of a corrupted priest, taken by a corrupted holy object.

In the end, Leverier Ranze fell twice to the same man.

I stood still, dumbfounded, in the abandoned abbey.

It was a place where the earth was shaking.

But for now, the world was lit only by scorched ruins, billowing smoke, and the pale winter moonlight.

Looking away from the decapitated body of the former Crusader Knight Commander and his helplessly rolling head, I stare up at the sky in disbelief.

In the end, I wasn't where I needed to be.

What to say.

Again, if you say you couldn't be there because of something unspeakable.

What would Ellen say.

No, I don't know if I've earned the right to say that.

To prevent the Empire from splintering, you planned and accomplished a monstrous task: the destruction of a former Crusader Knight Commander and a secret religious order.

I try to figure out what excuse to give Ellen.

This is supposed to be funny, but it didn't feel funny at all.

"......."

As I stood under the winter night, a message popped into my mind.



[Special Achievement - Turning Point in History].

[Confirmed death of a key character (Reverie Lance) who was supposed to be in the original worldline].



An inflection point in history caused by killing someone.

That was a first.



[Gained the "Apostle" trait as a special achievement reward].



Trait: Apostle

Description: You have become the true master of your Tiamata.



It was simple.

I thought I knew what this meant.

Tiamata as a magic sword, Tiamata as a holy sword.

I became a true champion of Tuan, the first person in history to be able to handle both.



* * *



Late at night.

A thunderous cheer erupted from the still heated Miss & Mr. Temple contest venue.

The long, long contest was over, and all that remained was to announce the winner.

Glistening pollen drifted from the ceiling of the auditorium.

Olivia Ranze, who was considered a strong favorite to win, did not participate.

Reason for absence unknown.

-This year's Miss Temple is a freshman in the Royal Class! This is Miss Ellen!

But Ellen beat out all the other strong candidates to be crowned this year's Miss Temple.

Amidst the applause and cheers, a wreath and bouquet of flowers were presented to Ellen in a white dress.



Her Royal Class classmates were also clapping in congratulations for Ellen.





However, Ellen's expression was stony as she accepted the honor. Holding the colorful wreath and bouquet of flowers that signified her victory, Ellen could only stare blankly down.

Ellen, who only needed one vote, got a bunch of them.

Most of the votes, except for that one.

So many people chose you.

Ellen couldn't help but feel like the world had abandoned her.
