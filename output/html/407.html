            Episode 407.





Imperial Emperor Emperatos, Winter Palace.

"So, how does it feel to have the support of two warriors?"

"I can see that you're starting to get in the mood to take a pill, but I don't want to react to it."

Charlotte replied bluntly to Bertus's words.

"Who knows what would have happened if Ellen Artorius had become your guardian knight, if you had closed your eyes and gotten engaged to Reinhardt because you couldn't bite?"

Charlotte narrowed her eyes at Bertus's malicious sneer.

"I don't want to go down in history as the princess who was killed by her own knight, do you?"

Charlotte's nonchalant remark caught Bertus off guard.

"Do you really think Ellen would do that?"

"Maybe not, but at least Reinhardt will be disillusioned with me, I'm sure. I hate that more."

Bertus can't help but be dumbfounded by Charlotte's frank admission that she would rather be hated by Reinhard than die at the hands of a jealous Ellen.

He was never one to be overly outspoken about his feelings.

But after accepting defeat, Charlotte was in many ways overly candid.

"So what, you're not busy, you don't have anything to do, and you don't even like you, so why did you call your half-brother all the way to your palace?"

The current visit was the result of Bertus telling Charlotte to stop by the Winter Palace.

Charlotte's predicament now was that she had to come because Bertus had told her to come.

Support was solidified, but as long as Bertus knew that Charlotte's soul had been fused with the demon's, she would always be a fly.

"So, is there any progress in the study of the magical art of conjuring?"

Charlotte's expression hardened at that.

"You know what you're asking, don't you?"

"...... I know you don't like me, but I really don't know this time. All I know is that you've gotten a grimoire on seduction from somewhere and you're trying to do something with it."

Charlotte didn't understand Bertus's lack of knowledge. Charlotte was trying to keep it a secret, but Bertus had already gotten his hands on it and was playing with it.

If Bertus doesn't already know about the underground labyrinths of the Demon Castle, that's even more curious.

Bertus doesn't know what he needs to know.

That means the information is stuck in the middle.

"Lord Tana?

Tana is supposed to be neutral, but at some point, she's unknowingly siding with Charlotte.

It is possible that Saviolin Tana was somehow trying to keep the information about the conjugal art, which may have been Charlotte's final salvation, out of Bertus' ears.

As it turned out, Bertus had learned about the art of betrothal, but he didn't know that its source was the underground labyrinths of the Demon Castle.

Of course, Bertus may also know about the underground labyrinths of the Demon Castle.

However, if you somehow conceal the information that Charlotte, Tana, and Reinhardt traveled to the Demon King's Castle, you will not be able to make the connection between the spellbook on marriage and the underground labyrinth in the Demon King's Castle.

This means that Bertus is likely to have separate and distinct knowledge of both the Conjuration and the Underground Labyrinth.

If the information is properly blocked, there are only three people who know about the Demon Castle Underground.

Saviolin Tana, Charlotte herself, and Reinhardt.

Even the mages who studied the spell don't know where they got their grimoires, so while information about the spell can leak out, its source cannot.

The result of such a conjugal study.

"They say I have to live with it."

Charlotte had just gotten the results.

Bertus narrowed his eyes at Charlotte's calm words. By his reaction, it was clear that he was hearing this for the first time.

"Somehow, you don't seem too disappointed."

Indeed, Charlotte was nonchalant when she was told that her condition could not be reversed by the conjuration.

So there you have it.

That's all I had to go on.

Bertus's expression hardened.

"Brother, you may not believe it, but I am deeply sorry to have to kill you. Not long ago, I had only Reinhardt to blame, but now I have to blame Ellen Artorius. Even if it means I have to kill you, and even if the entire continent agrees with me. Basically, they're both assholes, and I think Reinhardt is just a lesser asshole, but Ellen Artorius is just as bad or worse than Reinhardt. It's not like I can't deal with them, of course, but when they kill you and then kill two warriors who are treated like the hope of humanity, I'm going to have to pray that they hang them painlessly?"

Bertus stammered, his expression a mixture of genuine annoyance and bewilderment.

"I'm almost tempted to thank the devil that I've gotten you into this mess."

Charlotte giggled, covering her mouth as if she were enjoying just imagining the trouble Bertus would be in after her death.

Bertus crosses his arms sullenly and glares at Charlotte.

"Hey brother, I think you're being a little too casual about it being over once you're dead. Consider my situation. I'm in the position of having to choose between killing you and giving my head to prevent the Warlord Valier from being reborn as a halfling, or allowing the Warlord to be reborn and shifting the continent's power to fight a legitimate Demon War without Ragan Artorius. Even the current Demon problem is another matter. If that happens, I'll be physically fine, but the stress will kill me, I'm sure."

It's a bit of a mixed bag, but Bertus wasn't exactly wrong.

If you kill Charlotte now, you will die.

Waiting for the demon to take full control of Charlotte's body would create a major event that would require slaying the resurrected demon, giving Bertus a just cause, but at a great cost.

Ellen has become her own knight and Reinhardt values her.

Two facts alone have made his life too heavy for him.

It was heavy, then light, then heavy again.

Charlotte found the change quite amusing.

Bertus's concerns are certainly valid.

"Well, I can't say for sure, and I don't know if you'll believe it or not, but....... but somehow I don't think that's going to happen."

"......Based on what?"

Reinhardt told me a few times.

It contains the salt of the world's only superpower, the spirit.

Nothing should happen.

You'll be fine.

Nothing should happen.

In the midst of so many whispers that seemed to bring peace to her heart just by hearing them, Charlotte was subconsciously convinced.

I'll be fine.

And since the power doesn't take away his will, maybe he's actually okay now.

It told me that.

Charlotte believes in Reinhardt.

He believes in this transformation of body and soul because he believes in the many whispers Reinhardt has given him.

"Obviously, I'll be fine."

"No, I mean, based on what?"

Charlotte looks at Bertus and giggles.

-rrrrr

"!"

Charlotte's hair turns black, and she takes on the appearance of a demon with bloodshot pupils and a vertical slit.

Bertus's complexion went white at the sight of the horrifying figure, its dark, flailing hair, and what he could only assume to be the form of a demon, a fiend.

"Look."

An eerie voice rang out, scratching at the darkness, and with a wave of her hand, dozens of dark spears appeared out of thin air.

The spears were aimed at Bertus, but they remained fixed in midair, unmoving.

"Something that doesn't kill you when I'm like this."

"No, you. What the hell is this......."

"Isn't that evidence enough on its own?"

Charlotte became one with the demon.

To be precise, you've gained full control over some of the demon's powers.

This is a gift from Reinhardt.

Without Reinhardt, I would have been dead, and with the added bonus of demonic power.

Engagement was not an option.

"Rather, why should I give this up?"

But at this point, it was the only thing she could count on.



* * *



"If you were trying to scare me, you more than succeeded, brother."

Bertus nodded slowly, not exactly denying that he was frightened.

With that, Charlotte's fluttering hair settled back into place, and her eyes, as well as her hair, returned to their normal color.

"I can see you're scared. You should thank the devil."

"Why don't you stop making shitty jokes?"

To say she was scared is an understatement. Fainting is a fairly normal reaction when a perfectly healthy person suddenly sees a demonic figure trying to kill them.

Certainly, as far as Bertus could tell, Charlotte was not being controlled by the demon, but seemed to be in control of its power. Of course, he couldn't be sure if Charlotte was right, but he couldn't deny that she was stable.

Of course, it's a power that can't be displayed outwardly. Even those who don't know the details can agree that Charlotte is a very unpleasant and ominous figure when she reveals her true power.

It's a last resort.

It's just that Charlotte has one.

As powerful as this power is, it's impossible to survive as a continent's public figure, let alone the Empire's many knights. That's why the power to command so many armies with a single word is so frightening.

"Why did you bring that up? I don't think I asked you to post about it."

At Charlotte's question, Bertus crosses his arms and glares at her.

"Naturally, I'm curious as to your source. Where the hell did you get that grimoire on soul manipulation? Do you have some sort of secret society or connection?"

"Oh, was that it?"

We were able to figure out that Bertus knew about the Labyrinth, but he didn't know he'd been to the Demon Castle.

I could tell you where it came from. But he thought he was the only one who could break through the labyrinth with his demonic soul.

"Why, is there anything else?"

"Tell me what to do."

I'm not Bertus or Charlotte or a wizard.

They know that rare spellbooks are worth a fortune. And instead of being merchants who can turn it into money, they want to supply their army with that magic to boost their power.

Powerful magic is power, whether it's dangerous magic or dangerous sobriety, and it's a shame that the powerful have no power.

It doesn't matter if you tell Bertus the source. You're the only one who can get in there anyway.

But there's no reason to give it away.

You can't be emperor, but you can be in partnership with Bertus.

The things in the basement of the demon castle become Charlotte's property.

He lives in debt to Ellen, and in debt to Reinhard.

If, on his own, Bertus finds something useful in him, they may one day be able to stand face to face without debt.

"Okay. I'll get you a few more books then."

"Let's make a deal?"

"The fewer cards you have, the more you have to play with."

I said a few books, but Charlotte will bring you quite a few spellbooks.

It doesn't matter if you realize it's a vision of the Darklands, and then realize you found it in the basement of Demon Castle.

You're the only one who can get in there.

"Uh......."

"......."

Herriot brushed past Reinhardt, who seemed to hesitate slightly upon seeing him.

I've been avoiding Reinhardt lately because I don't know what to say.

She saw Ellen and Reinhardt talking to each other as they had before. She saw Charlotte and Ellen, now Guardian Knights, bickering oddly, and then she saw the three of them walking around together.

Herriot couldn't figure out what to do.

When Reinhardt told her they were getting engaged, her head seemed to go blank.

I couldn't study, couldn't research.

Charlotte's life was in danger, so I couldn't tell her not to do it.

So, we'll just have to wait and see.

Just when you think you're going to have to walk away.

When Ellen became Charlotte's knight, the engagement became as untrue as a lie.

It was something he couldn't do himself.

Only Ellen Artorius, sister of Lagan Artorius and owner of Ramen, could do that.

Ellen's symbolism is even stronger than Reinhardt's, and by becoming Charlotte's knight, she can ensure Charlotte's safety.

Ellen did what he couldn't, so Reinhardt doesn't have to get engaged.

So, I guess I should be happy.

Herriot wasn't happy about it at all.

So when she saw Reinhardt getting back together with Ellen, she couldn't do it.

I know that if I approach them, make myself comfortable, and treat them like I used to, they'll treat me like I used to.

But.

After all, isn't that the end of the story?

Reinhardt always feels a little sorry for himself.

I'm sorry.

Sorry.

That's it.

You can't go any further than that.

I always thought I was next in line for Ellen.

It wasn't.

You were always last.

It's not about repairing relationships, it's about caring.

Sometimes Charlotte comes first.

Sometimes Ellen comes first.

Sometimes Olivia was first.

Self was always next.

The arrogant Herriot of old would have resented it, would have been angry. "I don't deserve this," she would have thought.

But once he sheds his arrogance, he decides to treat people as people, and he stays that way.

It was chipping away.

I know it's hard to have expectations, but this is enough. That's enough, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough.

Suddenly.

It's not about humility, it's about facing up to your fallen pride.

It's nice not to have to hold your hand.

Because you don't need a hug.

I find myself settling into a state of complacency, thinking that just being there is enough.

This is incorrect.

Settling for someone who doesn't like you to care about you out of guilt.

It's just miserable.

If you're only going to end up miserable and defeated, it's time to fold.

"Harriet, are you okay?"

"Huh? Ah....... Yeah."

At Adelia's worried words, Harriet nodded.

If it's not going to be reciprocated, let it go.

Reinhardt had risen too high for his own good. Maybe he's become something you can't even look at.

A seed sown in the soil of the mind grew and became a flower.

Just as a flower that doesn't bear fruit withers.

If it withers, only the heart should wither.

It was as if the soil in which the flower was rooted, even himself, was withering away.



* * *



Herriot leaves the temple and heads for the palace.

As I do, I make a promise to myself.

Let's forget about it.

Slowly.

When it's over, when all the hurt feelings are gone, we can go back to being normal friends.

Reinhardt would want that, Herriot thinks.

Just as Riana is comfortable with Reinhardt because she doesn't like him, so should I be.

Let's talk about it after a very long time.

I liked you back then.

A lot.

I used to love it a lot.

"......."

She took to the streets, eventually bursting into tears in the middle of the street.

"Bad....... Bad....... bad guy......."

You know what I like.

We didn't really talk about it for fear of breaking something, but in the end, we all knew.

I couldn't bear to think about it. I would rather say something.

I could go on and on about how you're an asshole and the worst person in the world.

There's no reason to like him.

You know he's a terrible person, and you know it's your own fault for liking him.

I'd rather hate it, and then this feeling of inferiority and defeat will go away.

Let's hate it.

Let's just hate and hate and hate. Let's shoot you in the face and say you're an asshole and then walk away.

We'll be friends later? That's not going to happen.

With that vow, Herriot walked the streets, rode the horse-drawn train, and made his way to the palace.
