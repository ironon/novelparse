            Episode 589.





The stairs down to the basement were not long. As they descended through the rubble to the entrance, the stench grew more and more unbearable, and the fetid scent of blood rose to disgusting levels.

"What the heck is......."

Ellen nervously pushed open the door to the temple's basement.

In the saccharine darkness, a cloak of the sun was draped over Ellen's shoulders, and soon, beside her, searing flames from the sun's cloak pushed back the darkness.

Soon, as the darkness receded, a long hallway appeared, with rooms all around.

The basement was not affected by the fire.

But the corridors were littered with bodies, some unclaimed, some not.

"Here too......."

Ludwig was wide-eyed, staring blankly down the hall.

There was a secret room in the temple.

The stench that rose to the surface was the smell of blood and filth from the corpses.

"I think killing the people here was the original purpose of the raiders."

Unlike Ludwig, who was fed up, Ellen walked calmly down the hall.

What does this temple, and the dead underground people, mean.

'I think that's what this place is really about in the first place.......'

Not too many people, but not too few either.

Ellen walked down the underground corridors, glancing at the various rooms.

Some rooms looked like dining rooms, some looked like storage rooms, and some were bedrooms.

'The surface was a cover, the underground was real, and there were more people living there than I'd ever heard of.......'

Ellen's eyes caught sight of a few weapons, including a fallen sword and spear.

'Traces of battle, not massacre.......'

'This is where the raiders and the people in the basement got into a fight.'

But more importantly, it was impossible to tell which of the bodies were attackers and which were victims. None of them were wearing priestly robes.

In the basement, there were more stairs leading down.

And a foul odor was rising from the basement.

Ludwig wasn't terrified, but he was more confused than ever, knowing that more people were dead, and that the temple was serving a purpose that was far different than it appeared.

Ellen has reached the second floor of the basement.

"Is this....... What is this......?"

Ludwig froze, mumbling to himself.

Ellen stares out into the open space, muttering to herself.

"Prison."

There were cages in what looked like a large detention center.

And the prisoners were dead, hanging from the walls.

'Cause of death is penetrating....... He was stabbed with a spear-like weapon.'

Ellen circles the second floor of the basement and sees the bodies beyond the bars.

'The other bodies all have the same cause of death, which means they were stabbed from the outside of the cage to the inside, with a spear....... Most likely by execution.'

"Judging by the scars on each body, they must have been tortured, not just locked up, and there are quite a few rooms that look like torture chambers.

"Imprisonment, and Torture.

"Were the people who stormed this place trying to rescue people who were trapped?

"If that's the intent, then these people weren't killed by raiders, they were killed by people in the basement of this temple.

"I'm not sure if the goal was to rescue or not, but I'm guessing it failed.

"Who are these people, and why are they locked up here?

"Ellen......."

Ellen's musings were interrupted by Ludwig's rapturous voice.

Ludwig, who calls himself Ellen, is standing in front of a cage, staring blankly into it.

"I....... I saw this person yesterday."

"What?"

With that, Ellen moved to Ludwig's side.

A mysterious prisoner, impaled on a spear. But of course, Ellen didn't recognize the person in front of her.

Ludwig's eyes were shaking violently.

"Yesterday....... Among those who tried to attack me and the priest....... There was this guy, apparently......."

"You were going to raid?"

Ludwig nods.

Ludwig briefly explained yesterday's situation.

There was an uproar over the pagans during the purge, and Rowen seemed to lose his cool a bit when he saw them. However, when he realized that they were Warrior Cultists, he gave up trying to help.

On their way back from the cleansing, the cultists attempted to attack Ludwig and Rowen, and Ludwig escaped with Rowen in tow.

One of the men who did is now dead in prison.

"You made it sound like you were going to leave them alone......."

"Actually, they were taken from a refugee camp....... or something like that."

Angered by Rowen's death, Ludwig sought Ellen's help.

However, we now have almost certain evidence that Rowen is very far from being a good person.

We don't know if this is the case with all of the people in the cages, but it is very likely that they are pagans.

And Rowen's demeanor at the sight of the heathen, who seemed to lose his cool, if only briefly.

Advisor's Office.

Now Ludwig has no choice but to know what this place is and who Rowen is.

"You can't possibly....... This is....... and the priest is......."

Ludwig mumbles something incoherent, and Ellen remains still, looking at the view of the prison.

"He must have been an inquisitor."

"......."

It's a place where heretics are interrogated, tortured, and indoctrinated.

If so, Archbishop Rowen would have been the priest equivalent of the leader of the Inquisitors.

Ludwig could only stare in disbelief, feeling betrayed and defeated.

It is almost certain that they were capturing and torturing the pagans in the refugee camps.

Ellen wasn't shocked, but that didn't stop her from exploring the dungeon.

The prison didn't just have cells and torture chambers. Ellen looked over the dead bodies to make sure there was nothing else unusual about them.

I realized they were refugees because they were skinny from not eating properly.

'I mean, they had enough force to inquisition and enough combat power to defend this place.......'

Raiding the strongholds of the Inquisitors.

So it was clear that it wasn't just a mob, and if it was a mob, it wasn't a normal mob.

'We stormed in to rescue them, but they'd already been killed for silence. And the entrance to the basement was sealed off by a collapse....... We're still not sure who did it.'

The raiders stormed the Inquisitor's headquarters, killing everyone inside before vaporizing the Inquisitors.

"In any case, the entrance to the basement was blocked by rubble, likely before the guards or marauders arrived.

A fire broke out, and the guards were called in.

The guards' inability to identify the space meant that the entrance to the basement had been blocked long before that.

Before anyone could see what they shouldn't, the Crusaders moved in and took jurisdiction of the case over to the Guard.

'You didn't let me in so I wouldn't see the shit you're doing here.......'

The sight of civilians being captured, tortured, and killed, even in the name of inquisition, was enough to make Ellen's blood boil.

But I can't stop Ellen from walking, so I can only make way for her in vain.

Ellen makes her way past the holding cells and torture chambers to the deepest room.

"Ellen......."

"Yes. I'm listening."

"If you're an Inquisitor, you're like....... paladins, you'd have to fight."

"I don't know, but I guess I should."

Though not necessarily, heretical inquisitors would have needed to have some real combat power, in case the pagans were dealing with dangerous forces.

"Then....... Mr. Rowen must be a high ranking Inquisitor."

"I'm sure you did."

"Then maybe Mr. Rowen....... who could actually fight?"

Head of the Inquisition.

Rather, they will need actual force.

Of course, this may not be the case. Those who sit on the papal throne of the Five Great Houses may have a great deal of divine power at their disposal, but they are not necessarily drawn from the ranks of paladins.

"Maybe not, but he was the one doing the outside work, so I'm sure he did."

But Lowen was on the ground, so he must have been a very good fighter. Maybe even better than Ludwig.

"...... Why the hell did they need security?"

Ludwig's confusion was palpable, and Ellen couldn't help but think that his questions were valid.

"If he's an inquisitor, he'll definitely be able to fight, and if he's just wandering around the refugee camps gathering information about the heretics or spying on them, there's no reason for him to be escorted by a guard, he'll be more comfortable moving around on his own. It doesn't make sense."

"Why on earth would they do that?"

"I don't know. Not yet."

That's definitely weird.

While we can't rule out the possibility that Rowen is indeed incapable of combat, it's odd that he's the head of the Inquisition and someone who's out in the field.

Ellen walked through the prison and came to a room at the end of another hallway.

When she opened the door, Ellen could see a desk, chair, and bookshelf inside.

It was the space of the person in charge.

The bookshelves were lined with books on the temple and theology, and Ellen approached the table.

There were a few papers scattered about, and most of them were encrypted, so Ellen couldn't tell what they meant by looking at them.

Since we were dealing with confidential information, it was only natural that all documents were encrypted.

But.

From there.

Ellen had a piece of paper she recognized.

"!"

It's not a paper trail.

Cautiously, Ellen lifts the single sheet of paper.

"Did you find anything?"

Ellen picked up the papers and handed them to Ludwig, who couldn't help but roll his eyes.

The one thing you can't recognize, but can recognize a password document.

The photos in those papers.

"My face is....... Why are you here......?"



There was a picture of Ludwig.

"I don't know what it says, but it's obviously a document with your name on it."

Just because you can't read it doesn't mean you can't infer what it says.

"I didn't need a bodyguard."

Ellen looks at Ludwig.

"I don't know why, but I think I reached out to you in the first place."

It was clear that Rowen had intentionally approached Ludwig.

For now, Ellen tucked the papers into her arms.



* * *



The Temple of Tuan, already disguised as a decaying temple, had a place underground where people were locked up and tortured.

Home of the Inquisitors.

I was able to see the hidden side of the temple.

Most of the Inquisitors were slaughtered by unidentified raiders.

A fire broke out, and after the fire, looters ransacked the temple.

And the entrance to the basement was blocked by the collapse after the fire, which was intentional.

Ludwig is stunned that Lowen is the one who has masterminded such a terrible thing.

Your work is done.

Ellen returned to the surface with a stunned Ludwig.

At Ellen's command, the paladins were not allowed to enter or leave the area.

The paladins were supposed to prevent Ellen from seeing this, but they couldn't stand in her way.

Ellen doesn't know if they have anything to do with the Inquisition or not. But they must know what this place is about, and they want to stop her.

If I were to be decapitated by the sword of an enraged warrior right here and now, I would have nothing to say.

The paladins say nothing, waiting for the words to come out of the warrior's mouth.

"You said you didn't have enough priests."

Ellen didn't judge them or ask for the truth.

They likely wouldn't know the details anyway.

"I guess there are still some priests left to kill people."

Ellen walked past them and said, "That's it.
