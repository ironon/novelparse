            Episode 524.





Heinrich was silent in the face of a short letter from his brothers saying they would kill him.

Wondering if it was the wrong letter, Heinrich checked the envelope again.

From a friend, to Heinrich von Schwarz.

So it couldn't have been a misdirected letter.

"What is it, what's that look on your face?"

Konorint asked, seeing Heinrich's expression harden.

Let's talk.

I got a strange letter.

But Heinrich folded the letter and tucked it into his arms.

"Uh, no. No big deal."

"...... is it?"

If this letter is a malicious prank by someone, there's nothing to say.

If the letter is truly meant to alert you to a crisis, then there's no point in sharing it because you'll be in danger just by knowing about it.

"I'm going to go now. I need to get some rest."

Heinrich gathered up the letters with a sinking feeling in his stomach.

Heinrich walked back through the garrison to his barracks with a stern look on his face.

After organizing the letters, Heinrich closes the entrance to the barracks and sits down in a chair to stare at a letter from an unknown person.

It's not a misdirected letter.

And there's no such thing as a friend who will write you a letter like this.

Anyone can write to Heinrich, so it's not impossible that this is just a prank.

It's a simple sentence that says your brothers are going to kill you, without any real content.

I can't believe this.

Trust is foolish.

But.

"When this is all over, will you return to Cernstadt?

If brothers start to see themselves as competitors instead of brothers.

Seriously, is it impossible for that to happen?

We could dismiss it as a bad joke, and I think we should.

But it was bringing up a possibility that Heinrich hadn't considered.

There's no na√Øve belief that the siblings are just letting the talented youngest back into the family fold.

But Heinrich understood that, at best, the brothers were trying to use me. They wanted to use me to strengthen their own influence, and with it, their hold on the High Command.

That's how I was taking it.

But then you take it a step further and kill yourself.

"That doesn't even make sense......."

This can't happen.

This can't happen.

No matter how strong his position in this war becomes, Heinrich does not see himself as Cernstadt's successor, nor does he intend to.

The current heir to the throne, Louise von Schwarz, is also a powerhouse in the ranks of the Swordmasters, and she continues to make her mark. So there's no shortage of accomplishments.

Heinrich, Ruiz, they're all just taking credit.

They're even at war right now.

This very important war is not yet over, and even if your brothers were actually willing to kill you, they would not attempt it.

Whatever the case, if the contents of this letter are true, it was after the war.

It should be.

What a ridiculous, dangerous, and foolish thing to do, to kill one of your own, one of the greatest forces in the Alliance, at this moment, just because he's a threat to the throne.

I don't know politics, I don't know my brothers, but if you think about it in a normal, rational way, this should never have happened.

Before it's all over, before you've even gotten past the brink.

You don't want to make stupid choices for the next crisis after that one.

But. there's also unnecessary politics and favoritism going on here.

People are stupid, Heinrich knows.

Even within this army of men with a cause, Heinrich saw and experienced the foolishness of those who still looked too far ahead or too far behind.

But.

Still, if the sibling.

The brothers call themselves.

You don't want to kill it.

Shouldn't that be the case?

"Yeah, that can't be right......."

Heinrich burned the letter in his hand, destroying it as a useless distraction.

Heinrich stared at the scattered remains of the letter as it turned to black ash.

It was time for everyone to go to bed, and it was time for Ellen to go to bed as well, since she didn't have any night ops commitments.

For some reason, he kept a cat that liked him for a while, and eventually brought him to the barracks.

I was originally going to put it back in the restaurant where it belonged.

'He's a kitten, don't you think you should stay with him? She's been abandoned.......'

Adelia's words made Ellen think for a while, and she finally brought a cat to the barracks.

The cat seemed to struggle for some reason, and eventually, unable to get out of Ellen's arms, it somehow managed to drag itself into Ellen's barracks.

Somehow, my foggy consciousness and mind seemed to calm down a bit.

As he released the ceremonial armor he was wearing, the cat watched as the armor returned to its rack.

It's strange, and I wonder if I'm in this place because of an encounter with a strange little beast.

Ellen found it bizarre that her hazy consciousness could be restored by just one cat.

I feel like I've fallen under some kind of magic.

That's it, Ellen is going to wash up.

Ellen stares at the cat.

We don't know where or how it came from.

It wasn't particularly dirty, but I'm sure it was rolling around in the dirt of the garrison.

Although she'd never owned an animal before, Ellen thought she should wash the kitten. Dirt wouldn't be good for the kittens.

Ellen picked up the cat, which was sitting still on the barracks carpet.

-Angel

Cradling the small crying cat in her arms, Ellen made her way to the barracks' bathroom area.

And I wonder if he realized where he was being pulled.

-Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!

"......?"

-Cat!

The cat began to squirm in Ellen's arms, as if sensing its fate.

"I need to wash."

-Ahoy!

"......."

When they entered the bathroom, the cat squirmed, as if to say "no," and then slipped out of Ellen's arms.

Ellen watches as the cat drops to the floor and scurries away.

I can't even hide properly, so I'm shivering with my head stuck in the corner of the tent.

I don't think it's fair to force them to wash when they don't want to.

Ellen didn't want to bother the little creature.

"......."

If you think about it, cats don't like water.

Ellen unbuttoned her shirt, thinking the myth must be true.



* * *



After washing up in the bathroom, Ellen wondered what was so scary, so she scooped up the kitten with its head in the corner and sat it on her lap.

While I popped his head with a towel, the cat sat still and purred.

I wonder if it's cold.

You said you felt like you were sick.

If you look closely, you'll notice that it seems stiff, like it's a little broken.

Unlike the image of a sleek cat, this one looks a bit creepy.

As she dried her hair, the cat slowly got up, slid off Ellen's lap, and began to cry at the entrance to the tent.

-Angel

"......?"

It's like asking someone to open a door for you.

Ellen's tent has a different lock than the others.

This means that these small animals, as well as humans, can't just walk in and out.

"Are you going to......?"

I thought it was a little weird to talk to an animal, but that's what Ellen asked.

A kitten abandoned by its mother, or so Ellen had been told.

So, with nowhere else to go, I wonder where it's going at night, or if it knows how to get back to its mother.

Unable to tell what he was thinking, Ellen could only stare at the cat.

The black cat stares at himself, too.

One is speechless, the other is mute.

I don't know how long we stared at each other in silence.

As if giving up, the black cat walked back toward Ellen from the entrance of the teepee and tried to leap onto Ellen's cot.

-Puck!

-Ang!

"!"

He wasn't used to jumping, though, and landed headfirst on the corner of Ellen's cot, which wasn't very high.

"Are you okay......?"

Ellen gently picked up the black cat, who was sprawled out on the barracks carpet, and placed it on the cot.

A cat that can't jump.

-Burr

The cat sits still next to Ellen and purrs.

It was almost as if he was embarrassed, and Ellen couldn't help but smile.

Then, Ellen was surprised to find herself laughing.

This is the only thing that makes me laugh.

I'm not done laughing yet.

Ellen finished drying her hair with a towel and tickled the nape of the cat's neck, which was still trembling in shame.



* * *



The cat seemed to have given up trying to get somewhere and decided to stay in Ellen's barracks.

Now that the job is done, all Ellen needs to do is rest.

It's also important to rest properly. No matter how strong Ellen is, the battlefield takes its toll in an instant. If you don't sleep or rest properly, it will affect you the next day.

The fatigue and flashes of consciousness I've been feeling lately are qualitatively different from that.

It certainly doesn't make you less combat capable.

Even as your consciousness fades, even as your vision blurs, your sword knows the way to go, and your body moves on its own, swinging in the optimal path toward the enemies you need to tear apart.

It's a strange sense of deprivation, as if another being is taking over your body as your own consciousness fades.

As such, Ellen felt as if her body had been taken over by someone else and that someone else was wielding her body instead.

So even when I felt like I was suffocating under the weight of fatigue and pressure, I was in a strange state of mind where my combat power was actually increasing, not decreasing.

Turning off the light and lying on her cot, Ellen stares at the black cat curled up in front of her face.

The black cat's golden eyes, and the pupils within them, dilated in the darkness, stared back at him.

It was a very close call.

If they were human, they'd be close enough to see their reflection in each other's eyes.

Ellen has never owned an animal.

Even in my hometown of Rizaira, there were a few families with dogs, but no cats.

In Lizaira, animal was usually a word for hunting.

I never thought about growing it, of course.

It's not that I haven't seen cats before, but I've never seen them this close before.

But today, Ellen reached out to a cat she'd never seen before, a cat that shouldn't be in a place like this.

The cat licked his fingers as if he knew something.

That unfamiliar sensation.

But the sensation felt strangely familiar, like a reminder of something Ellen was losing.

Before he knew it, he had brought this strange cat into his tent, and now he was staring at it from his bedside.

The cat continues to stare at itself in the dark.

Golden eyes.

Those eerily familiar eyes.

For some reason, Ellen felt like the little animal understood her.

Ellen laughed at herself for thinking that.

"I can see why some people have animals....... I think I understand."

-.......

Despite not being able to speak, it's not nurturing.

They grow because they can't speak.

You can project any emotion you want and arbitrarily assume you're understood.

You don't know anything, but you think you know everything.

In that moment of feeling understood in the cat's eyes, Ellen realized it was a reflection of her own need to be understood.

The black cat gently nuzzled his head against Ellen's face.

I think it's just an illusion of understanding, as if I really do understand.

Ellen placed her hand on the cat's back and stroked its head gently.

It was amazing that such a small being could hold onto my fading consciousness.

I felt a little less tired, overwhelmed, and hopeless.

So something was definitely happening now. Of course, due to the effects of fatigue, Ellen's consciousness was sinking deeper and deeper into sleep.

I somehow managed to stay awake today with the help of that little being, but I wonder how far this can go.

The little guy will only get a little help.

It's bound to go away at some point.

"I don't want to disappear....... I don't......."

Ellen grows increasingly drowsy and looks at the cat through glassy eyes.

In a blur of consciousness.

Somehow, Ellen thought she saw a tear in the corner of the little cat's eye.

The cat could cry.

Ellen felt funny thinking about it.

Since when are tears only for humans?

Because humans can cry, and humans are animals after all.

Tears are not of men, but of beasts.

Then, of course, cats can cry.

However, Ellen didn't know why the cat was crying.

A person should be crying, but a cat is crying.

"Don't cry......ma......."

In her fading consciousness, Ellen gently wiped the tears from the kitten's eyes.





* * *



As far as sleeping goes, Ellen tends to sleep a lot.

Back in the good old days, Ellen was the kid who always woke up late, whether she went to bed early or late.

I didn't have a mother, father, brother, or sister to blame for sleeping in.

The boy who woke up late became the girl who woke up late.

But when Ellen went to the temple, she realized that she was used to rules.

I was able to wake up much earlier than my standard bedtime and do my morning workout.

It wasn't until I was older that I realized that I could sleep less whenever I needed to, and that I could sleep less if I had to.

At Temple, I cut back on sleep voluntarily, and now that I'm in the military, I cut back on sleep out of necessity.

And it's not just Ellen. It seems like everyone needs to start their day early.

The days are getting shorter, so Ellen wakes up in the early hours of the morning with the sky still dark and has to get to the command center for Operation Hadal.

After making the proper preparations, Ellen donned her inner armor.

-Bang, bang, bang, bang!

When she activates the armor holder, Ellen's usual ceremonial armor clings to her body and the seams of the armor weave themselves together.

He wears the Moon God's sword at his waist and the Sun God's cloak over his shoulders.

Although there are no major missions for the time being, Ellen is assigned to the vanguard, a fixed task that requires her to constantly check the safety of the garrison's marching routes and slay any monsters that appear.

You're assigned to a unit by your command center, receive operational orders, and head out into the field.

Because camping is so dangerous, we usually try to wrap up missions in the same day, but sometimes it takes a few days.

-Angel

"That must have been loud......."

Woken by the sound of the armor being put on, Ellen watched as the black cat yawned on the bed, rubbing its eyes.

The black cat stared at Ellen, wide-eyed and fully armed.

Wearing colorful plates all over her body, Ellen squatted in front of the still-sleeping cat.

He gently tickled the cat's nape with his index finger.

"...... offended."

Ellen cautiously bit her hand, wondering if the metallic feel of the gauntlet around her hand would be harmful to the cat.

"I have to go."

It's only been a day, and Ellen has gotten used to talking to her cat.

As if he understood, the cat hopped off the bed and settled down next to Ellen.

-Puck!

"......."

-.......

Just as I wasn't used to jumping, I wasn't used to landing, and I couldn't even get off that little bed properly, so I spun around and landed on my stomach.

How clumsy.

Still, the cat got up and cried at the entrance to the tent.

Do they really understand what they're saying?

Ellen had such strange thoughts.

When I unlocked it and opened the tent, there was already a bustle of early risers.

Ellen isn't the only early riser.

The black cat that exited the tent with them also cries at Ellen's side.

-Angel

Just as Ellen was trying to go somewhere, the cat seemed to be trying to go somewhere.

In the same way that a cat can have the illusion that it understands you, Ellen somehow felt like she knew what the cat was trying to do.

It was the strangest feeling I've ever had in my life.

Were cats originally free animals?

Ellen doesn't know much about this.

But just like you're trying to get somewhere, the cat seems to be trying to get somewhere. Even though it doesn't seem to be able to run properly.

Whatever it is, you can't force it. There's no such thing as yourself.

Ellen looks down at the cat looking up at her, and Nazik says.

"Wow, again."

-Angel

With a meow that seems to be an answer, the cat begins to walk cautiously away.

You say you're going, but the cat gets there first.

I told him to come back, but will he really come back?

That's an unknown.

Sleeping with a strange cat isn't a bad thing, even if it's a one-night-only oddity in your life. It was quite an experience.

But if the black cat comes around again, that's not a bad thing either.

With that thought, Ellen walked down the street.
