            Episode 431.





Ellen and Charlotte returned to the ecliptic.

Ellen asks what to do with Radia Schmidt's body, but Charlotte says it's evidence and should be kept.

The discovery of Temple's disappearance in the castle of Epiaks is a big deal, regardless of the truth of the case, and one of the pieces of evidence.

At a stopover, a wooden coffin was airlifted in which Radia Schmidt's body was placed, and they returned to the ecliptic.

It didn't take long to get back to the ecliptic from the bitterly cold land.

People were looking at Ellen as if she were an oddity, dragging a wooden pipe, but neither of them were in any condition to care what others thought.

"Reinhardt must have gone to investigate Richie's grave, that's what I know."

Ellen nodded at Charlotte's words.

In the meantime, Reinhardt is in the Darklands with the Imperial Elite and Harriet to investigate a murder on the Ecliptic.

Ellen and Charlotte don't know what Reinhardt wants.

However.

As Charlotte headed toward the palace with the woodcutter in tow, she stopped dead in her tracks.

"......."

Charlotte stopped walking, so Ellen glared at her.

Ellen watches as Charlotte's face contorts in depression and pain.

"Ellen......."

"Yes."

"I....... can't do it."

Charlotte's voice was shaking violently with depression.

"I....... This....... This, with my hands....... I can't do anymore....... I can't do it anymore......."

Charlotte didn't have the courage to take another step forward, knowing that the truth she would discover would shatter her.

Now I need to know something, I need to dig.

Charlotte felt like she couldn't do anything more, as the truth seemed to be staring her in the face.

They're both intuiting something.

But intuition alone doesn't solve anything.

I need to get to the bottom of this, to have some reason to believe something. Ellen stares at Charlotte.

"Yeah."

"......."

Charlotte can't go any further.

Ellen was scared now, too, and she couldn't blame Charlotte, knowing what it was like to be scared and not want to back down, but end up backing down.

Ellen was afraid to dig deeper.

She has no intention of stopping, but Charlotte can't see the truth she's uncovered with her own eyes.

"Let's go to Bertus."

We need another power.



* * *



Bertus was having a busy time.

An incident inside the imperial palace.

Imperial elites set out to search the tomb of the Reach, but they weren't sure if the beast was truly there.

So there was still a search going on inside the palace, as well as across the ecliptic, and at Lothar Dwyn's home.

He was cautious about retrieving the spellbook Dwin had left behind, in case it had been tampered with.

Not only was the emperor busy with this, but the prince was also doing his own thing.

So it's understandable that I'd be annoyed by a request for an interview from a half-brother who looked like he'd been out of town for the weekend.

I didn't have time to discuss personal matters when I had enough on my plate, and I didn't see any reason to add to the nervousness that was already there.

But when Bertus heard reports that Charlotte had not come alone, but with Ellen Artorius, and that they had come to the Winter Palace with a wooden casket containing an unidentified corpse, he knew something was amiss.

And when I saw them both in their mismatched heavy coats, I was convinced.

Something's been going on over here, too.

"What's going on?"

But they were also tired and sensitive, so Bertus sat them down and got to the point.

Charlotte was speechless.

Ellen was speechless.

However, Charlotte grabbed a quill pen from the table and began to scribble something down.

But Bertus noticed that Charlotte's hand was shaking violently as she scribbled something down.

"......What's wrong with you?"

"......."

Charlotte remains silent at Bertus's question, her head down, scribbling away.

Why write when you can speak?

Because it holds the possibility of a truth that is too disastrous and frightening to speak.

His hand was shaking so badly that the writing was a mess, but not unrecognizable. Ellen didn't speak, just stared out the window.

There was no time for this, but Bertus remained still, waiting for Charlotte to finish scribbling something down.

For a half-brother who would rather die than show weakness, to do something like this must mean something very important.

"......here."

The scribbled words on the paper Charlotte handed me.

Bertus slowly begins to read it.

It summarized what Charlotte had learned so far, albeit in a confusing handwriting.

From the past, when Charlotte actually had some idea of the Demon's whereabouts, to Elena's.

Letters delivered and evaporated and tracked. The raid on Leverier Ranze. And Olivia and Adriana.

The visit to the castle of Epiax and the gargoyles, as well as the story of the attack on Radia Schmidt there and the wooden coffin they brought with them containing the body of the missing Radia Schmidt.

All those stories were about different things, but they were all pointing to one thing.

Reinhardt.



[It is very possible that Reinhardt was a person associated with the Devil].



The horribly distorted handwriting spoke volumes about Charlotte's misery at having to write it in her own hand.

The shock of the sentence itself, aside from the hard evidence and rationale behind its content, left Bertus speechless.

"Nonsense."

So, after a long silence, Bertus' first words could only be.

"I wish....... I hope so. Please, please, please I hope so....... I really hope so....... I really want....... Really......."

In front of Bertus, Charlotte's hands in her lap with her head bowed.

Bertus watched, wide-eyed, as a tear fell on him.

Even more than this unbelievable suspicion, Bertus was horrified that Charlotte was crying in front of him.

"I....... I was going to....... I did, but....... I can't do it anymore....... You, you can't....... I thought you could do it for me....... If you do......."

If Reinhardt was connected to the Devil, the revelation would be devastating to the empire and the imperial family, but they had caught a very serious security threat.

Just as Bertus's elimination of the revolutionary forces had taken the initiative out of the hands of the monarchy, this was a big enough deal that Charlotte could use it to get back into the race for the throne.

But Charlotte holds onto the clue and hands it over to Bertus.

It even asks.

I want you to finish the rest.

The truth, already half-convinced, is so painful that he asks Bertus to dig it all out for him, fearing that he will destroy himself.

No, it's already broken.

Still staring out the window, Ellen wordlessly put her arm around Charlotte's shoulders.

Despite her expressionlessness, Ellen is probably not much different than Charlotte when she investigates this together.

Ellen is not expressionless.

I was stunned.

Bertus looks back and forth between Charlotte and Ellen.

A broken half-brother. A disenchanted classmate.

And Reinhardt.

Seeing Charlotte in a panic, Bertus takes the paper into his arms.

Reinhardt is associated with the Devil.

What happens if this is true.

I don't have time for "that" stuff, like what happened at the imperial palace.

Bertus stares at his half-brother, who is begging for help, his life in tatters and completely broken.

If this is true.

How Charlotte de Gradias would feel betrayed.

You've been used, you've been taken advantage of, and you've been taken advantage of.

You've been betrayed by everything you've tried to find a home for.

Bertus is more pathetic than ever to his half-brother.

With more heart than ever before.

"Don't cry, brother."

"......."

"I've got this."

He said.



* * *



Charlotte returned to the Palace of Spring, while Ellen stayed behind with Bertus.

Bertus and Ellen opened the wooden pavilion guarded by Winter Palace troops.

"Identification?"

"Missing Temple alumna Radia Schmidt has been identified."

"I see."

It had Ellen's endorsement, but it was also cross-validated.

Temple Royal Class Missing, Radia Schmidt, who was presumed dead during the raid on the Unnamed Order, has been found in the northernmost castle on the continent called Castle Epiax.

Radia Schmidt was killed by Ellen Artorius in combat after attacking Ellen and Charlotte de Gradias for an unexplained reason.

And in the pantheon-like structures that existed in that epoch, there were statues of wizards who supposedly hid the demons.

The day before the Demon's Crusade raid, Reinhardt visited Elena's scroll shop with Radia Schmidt.

Everything you need to know was written down on paper by Charlotte and passed on to you.

The conclusion is that Reinhardt is suspect.

Ever since that last unpleasant cross-dressing incident, Bertus had purposely avoided thinking about Reinhardt.

I gave up trying to understand it because I couldn't figure out why it was happening.

'......That's crazy.'

If Reinhardt has something to do with the Devil, then what the hell is that woman!

Bertus bit his tongue slightly, feeling like another accident was about to happen to him. To get his mind right.

The cross-dressing incident, after all.

As much as he hated to think about it, Bertus couldn't deny that there was a clue there.

What Charlotte and Ellen didn't know, and what they were both too afraid to ask Reinhardt directly, Bertus had already done.

If you've never thought of Reinhardt as suspicious, it's just something to do, but if you do think of Reinhardt as suspicious, it's the one clue you can't help but reach for.

'You said your identity was registered last year, obviously.'

Last year.

He wasn't wrong when he reported that many beggars were unregistered.

But it's odd when you think about it in terms of Reinhardt being suspicious.

Reinhardt suddenly appeared on the ecliptic last year.

Reinhardt didn't exist. At least until two years ago.

And another clue.

Reinhardt told him that the silver-haired girl he had seen that day was him.

There's no point in confessing to a heinous deed if you're not going to say it out loud, so Bertus and Reinhardt had to deal with a bizarre situation every time they met.

I didn't really need to say it.

"That's me.

Nevertheless, when Reinhard said he was going to do some research to find his brother, he had a seizure and blurted out the truth.

Bertus doesn't know why Reinhardt was cross-dressing.

Most importantly, Reinhardt confessed something he shouldn't have confessed anyway.

"They were afraid of the investigation itself.

I don't want Bertus to know things he shouldn't know, so I'm telling him before he gets to the dangerous stuff.

Risking embarrassment is one thing, risking death is another.

Reinhardt went to a cross-dressing contest. We don't know why.

But as soon as he heard that Bertus was investigating, speculating that the girl might be Reinhardt's brother, he gave up the truth.

That said.

This means that if you research Reinhardt, you'll learn things you shouldn't know.

"Get the date of Reinhardt's identity registration against the date of Charlotte's return to the ecliptic."

"Yes, Your Highness."

"And Ellen."

"Yes."

"There's a Rotary club south of the ecliptic. Do you know that?"

"......I know."

At Bertus's question, Ellen nodded.

"Take them in and interrogate them, drag them out if you have to."

"......Okay."

Ellen nodded slowly, and led the group of people Bertus had selected out of the palace.

Bertus watches Ellen's back as she leaves.

Did Reinhardt really come out of nowhere?

And when is that time?

What the hell is Reinhardt doing?

Bertus wants to know.

The image of Charlotte's horrified face could not leave Bertus's mind.
