All my efforts to find Akasha were in vain, because it was already in my grasp.

It all made sense to me.

Why there was only one wizard in Cantus Magna.

What the hell did the surviving Valier do in the original?



[Son].

[There is a certain amount of logic to all magic. A fireball has a reason for creating flames. Thunderbolts generate electrical discharges. The study of homunculi has the power to create life, and so does magic that manipulates cold and heat, magic that summons water, and magic that makes trees grow].

[All magic in the world contains, to a greater or lesser extent, a methodology for manipulating the world with mana].

[If we succeed in bringing together enough of the world's reasoning that we don't need that thing anymore, if we have the tools to do so].

[It would be possible to create a world through it].

[A tool of creation to extract reason and logic from magic to the point where the world could be constructed].

[Akasha is such a thing].

[The origin of Akasha is unknown. It may have been a shell created by the Five Gods for creation and abandoned somewhere, picked up and used by the wizards of Cantus Magna, or it may have been an artifact that the founding fathers of Cantus Magna created in hopes of completion and continued to perfect in later generations].

[Of course, if they hadn't foolishly tried to kill me and covet my magic, I would never have learned of Akasha].

[The process of capturing Akasha while pulling the wool over their eyes was complicated, but in the end I succeeded, and now I can dream of a different vision].

[not the peace attained by the destruction of mankind, but the attainment of paradise through creation].

[But nothing is certain at this point, as we don't know how this war will end].

[Son, if you're watching this, it means I'm not already in the world].

[As your father, I know your temperament best and have arranged for it, but I do not know if it will work].

[My son, only I and the Four Heavenly Kings, including you, know of Akasha's whereabouts and our true purpose. Don't you dare run your mouth about Akasha. Cantus Magna has self-destructed since Akasha's disappearance, but remnants may still be searching for her].

[Also, if humans were to learn of Akasha's whereabouts, they would naturally covet it. They will not believe us when we tell them what we intend to do with Akasha. The fact that we are at war with each other because we want peace is proof that there can be no trust between us].

[If I die and the Darklands are destroyed, you will not seek revenge through Akasha, but will walk the path of completing Akasha. Humans have always been our greatest, most dangerous, and powerful enemies, and the path of destroying them will be more difficult than leading our surviving compatriots through creation to paradise].

[Akasha is nearing completion].

[We have always fought wars for survival; there is no reason why we should wish for war and destruction when we have other alternatives].

[I am uneasy about leaving Akasha in your hands, but if I were dead, you would be the only Archdemon. You would be the only one who could lead our lost kin].

[Remember, running an unfinished Akasha will spell doom].

[Never be driven by petty vengeance].

[My son, I beg you].

[Complete Akasha].



With that, I closed the notebook on the last of the Squadron Valier's words.

Elise froze, as if she had seen it too, and doubted her own eyes.

"The Ancestral Demon King....... did not want war......."

Memories of a lost Bali.

It already had the answers and clues to everything.

That's how I got to Akasha after traveling all these miles.

The Akasha is itself a tool for recording the reason of the world, and when all reason is recorded, it is an object that can be used to create a world.

There were no portals to other worlds.

This world is made up.

Through a creation tool called Akasha.

It's also clear what Valier did after surviving the Demon War and fleeing to this bunker.

There's no way that Valier Jr. could have completed Akasha without being a cripple.

No vengeance and anger would have given him the strength and base he needed.

Valier Jr. may have been contemplating how to complete Akasha in this basement with a vengeance, only to realize that it was impossible for him to do so.

And.

Vaguely vengeful and fed up with his own incompetence, he activated the incomplete Akasha out of desperation.

A flimsy world that hasn't been built properly, and the monsters that are created by the unfinished laws of that flimsy world.

That would be the gate situation.



[Event Complete - Homicide Tracking].

[Earned 5,000 achievement points].

[Additional Reward - 10,000 Achievement Points].



[Challenge Complete - Identify Akasha].

[50,000 achievement points].



I finally understood why the challenge was called "Identify Akasha" and not "Find Akasha".

We had already found Akasha, we just had to figure out what it was.



[Challenge Complete - Find Cantus Magna].

[Earned 30,000 achievement points].



Cantus Magna has already destroyed itself. Unaware that the Demon Valier had seized Cantus Magna, it was torn apart from within as it searched for the whereabouts of the missing Akasha.

Infiltrating the Imperial Ministry of Magic, Lothar Dwin was a remnant of the defunct Cantus Magna.

There can only be one reason for his sudden murderous rampage and visit to Richie's grave.

Among the spellbooks Charlotte brought to the Imperial Ministry of Magic, there must have been magic that only existed in Akasha.

Your eyes should have flipped.

Magic has been discovered that only exists in the lost world of Akasha.

So after killing wizards and torturing them to find out where it came from, we couldn't figure it out, so we headed to the most likely place: Richie's tomb.

It's not just about getting a grimoire and putting it in Akasha.

He's here to retrieve his lost Akasha.

The achievement score quickly surpassed 100,000 points. And then it all came to an end.

The answer to everything, in the end, was too easy.

"If I don't do anything....... if I do nothing......."

Cantus Magna is long gone, and Akasha's owner has been Darkland for some time.

The trigger for the gate was Bali.

So, if I don't do anything, that alone won't cause a gate event.

Elise gently pulled me into her arms.

"Degrading....... Still, it's nice to know the truth......."

"Yeah, I guess so."

You just need to stop everything now before it happens.

If you do nothing, that's good enough.

I didn't find out until it was too late, and for that alone, I'm grateful.

I grabbed Eleris's arm.

Yes.

We've come to the end of the line.

If you don't want anything to happen, just live like you are now. No plotting, no planning, just living in the temple.

Once you've sorted out the issues with the Demon Cultists and their followers, there shouldn't be any major threats on the horizon.

We'll have to figure out what to do with Akasha as we go along.

Vali the Great wanted to create a world of Akasha, a world where humans and demons would never have to face each other. He wanted an eternal end to fighting.

But just like humans, Bali didn't trust humans.

The humans wouldn't have believed them when they said they were going to activate Akasha and leave for a new world. They would have thought that the humans who coveted Akasha would take it away from them.

Akasha is a magical tool that, if misused, can spell doom for the world.

Therefore, until the day he died, he would not tell the Four Heavenly Kings and Vali about Akasha.

Believing in Valier Jr. or the second coming of the Devil, who will be resurrected in Charlotte's body.

And it was my son, myself, who prevented the return of the devil.

The only ones who knew the truth were the Four Thousand Kings and Bali.

"Now I understand why Larken Simonsteid, a human....... sided with the Darklands......."

The first Sichuan King and Grandmaster, who was human. And Larken Simonstein, the teacher of Saviolin Tana.

One way or another, Valier had either recruited Larken Steinmetz or he had come to Valier.

The end of fighting through complete separation from each other.

Valerie's thoughts were shared, and he sided with Darkland.

Because that would be a better ending.

But then came the Demon War, and the heroes killed the Four Heavenly Kings and the Demon King.

The warrior party may or may not have been told the truth about Akasha by the Four Heavenly Kings.

In the end, a fight broke out, and the brave party died along with the Demon King of the Four Realms and the Demon King.

The Warrior Party may have heard of Akasha and fought to capture it, but we don't know the details.

That's why the four kings may have taken on the warrior parties one by one to persuade them, rather than joining together.

But the truth is now unknowable. The truth of the fight is outside my perception.

What's done is done.

Akasha is in my hands.

But I'm not the only one who knows this place.

Charlotte and Tana already know of this place, and Charlotte has even decided to supply the imperial court with spellbooks from it.

She may not realize it now, but Charlotte will eventually realize that this place is very strange.

What happens when the imperial family finds out about Akasha.

Unknown.

But we can't just leave it at that.

Now that everything is clear, there's no reason to delay.

It is a very dangerous artifact, but it has infinite utility, and it may be the one thing that can end all feuds between demons and humans.

I may be the one to fulfill the dream that Valier never had, the one that Valier Jr. gave up on in the original.

If Charlotte messes with Akasha without knowing more about it, she could end up gating Charlotte, which is not a good thing.

"I'm sure there's a way to move Akasha to a different location, but that's something I'll have to figure out later......."

Once I was missing from Richie's grave, I knew there would be an uproar.

"First, we need to get back to the ecliptic."

The later I come back, the more out of control the situation will get.



* * *



"An instrument of creation......."

Outside the battlefield.

Antirrhinus listened to the story as he stood facing Akrich.

"Yeah, you guys have Akasha and you don't even seem to realize it's Akasha."

Akrich Lukren came to Ritchie's grave because the spellbook contained magic that Cantus Magna had developed.

With the discovery of Akasha's traces, Lukren realized this was his last chance to retrieve her.

Why I couldn't find Cantus Magna until now.

Why Lukren came to Ritchie's grave alone.

It all made sense to Antirrhinus.

Cantus Magna was destroyed when Akasha was stolen and, unable to determine who had stolen her, they suspected each other.

And it wasn't someone on the inside who stole Akasha, it was the Ancestral Demon Valie.

And the current Demon King didn't realize until now that what he held was Akasha.

"If you help me get Akasha back, I'll forget what you've done. Tell me, Antirianus, where is Akasha?"

All that is past is forgotten, as long as you cooperate in finding the lost tools of creation.

Antirrhinus shakes his head slightly at Akrich's words.

Whether you believe it or not is another matter.

"Lucren, why do you want to be a god?"

"......what?"

"Do you think it would be fun to be a god?"

Antirrhinus narrowed his eyes as if he didn't understand Lucren's words.

"To be the absolute, where everything in the world functions according to my will and I can orchestrate everything to my will."

"So why do you assume it's going to be fun?"

Antirhynchus smiles at you.

"The joy of life and the world is its unpredictability."

"Do you think that an all-powerful force that functions only in a world where everything moves according to my will, and only according to my will, and where at a wave of my hand everything returns to nothingness, can give you what you call pleasure?"

"Yeah, it might be fun for a little while."

"But you'll soon lose interest."

"If you don't like it, you tear it down and rebuild it, tear it down and rebuild it, tear it down and rebuild it, and at the end of the process, what's left but boredom?"

"For what is there left but boredom?"

"If delusions of grandeur are the only aspirations that Cantus Magna has ever nurtured....... I am exceedingly disappointed."

"The world is only pleasant as a creature. If you become a god and create a world, however perfect it may be, and if you face it not as a creature but as a creator, what can you gain from it but admiration for the technical solidity of a well-made sculpture?"

"Without despair, sorrow, pain, anger, hatred, and wrath, there would be no joy, ecstasy, ecstasy, pleasure, and, of course, happiness and love."

"Lukren. The world is chaos, and I love it."

"Being an organizer of chaos is, as it turns out, a very boring job."

Antirrhynchus's words made Lucren forget.

"You're crazy, you'll stop at nothing to become a god."

"If you're going to use Akasha for something so boring, I can't have you having Akasha."

Antirrhinus smiles.

"I told you, Lukren. I've always wondered what Akasha was, never thought I wanted it."

Antirrhinus raised his staff.

"At least the boy I know will have more fun with Akasha than you will."

"Antirrhinus....... This crazy old man......."

Lucren, still recovering from the aftereffects of using magic on such a large scale, was no match for Antrianus now.

There is only one reason to reject the path to godhood: it would be boring.

Lucren sees the madness flashing in the old vampire's golden eyes.

"Lucren, will you show me your despair one last time?"

The embodiment of madness beyond good and evil.

"Show me the pain, despair, and wretchedness of having an aspiration that has been dreamed of for an immeasurably long time, only to end up in this place."

A mad wizard in search of despair and heat.

"After all this time, you've shown me a very uninteresting vision, so the least I can do is give you a proper scream."

Antirrhinus raised his staff.
