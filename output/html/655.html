Riana's meeting with Cliffman wasn't really necessary.

It doesn't really matter if Cliff is on our side or not.

But Riana only met Cliff.

That's what I thought when I saw it.

I've been there.

Still, I've always done things with a purpose.

I'm the same way, and I think it's okay to meet someone once in a while who just wants to watch.

Just as Riana was scared, I was scared.

I was afraid that Adriana would take out her anger on me.

But Adriana didn't blame me, as Cliff did.

I wanted to be presumptuous and take her off the battlefield, but she refused. I knew she would refuse.

In fact, by that logic, if someone shouldn't fight, there shouldn't be a single soldier in the Allied forces. There would be no such thing as someone who was forced to fight.

So it was no surprise that Adriana rejected my selfishness.

I hope you survive.

Not Adriana, not me, not anyone else.

The promise of survival is not a guarantee of survival.

Regardless of those promises, someone is going to die.

Because that's what war is, that's what fighting is.

"Are you okay?"

"Uh, okay."

Back in Razak, I nodded at Harriet's question.

"Your expression has gotten worse."

I did.

Harriet puts her hand on my cheek, looking worried.

Riana seemed to have gotten over it.

Meeting Adriana made me feel even heavier. We didn't argue or anything, but Adriana was worried about me.

I should be feeling better, but I've sunk further.

Still, I don't regret meeting Adriana.

"It's just, I want to do better."

"......?"

"That's why."

After a brief lapse, I realized I needed to do better.

You can't keep them all.

It's not wrong to want to protect everyone.

"Christina, what's wrong?"

"......."

When asked by Louis Ankton, Christina simply sat at her desk with a blank expression on her face.

It was Christina's dogma that was holding Ellen hostage.

Neither Louis Ankton, Anna, nor Ludwig had any idea that Christina was trying to do such a thing.

So, to the rest of the world, she just looks like she's suddenly pale and speechless.

She couldn't tell him she'd done it.

"What's wrong?"

"No, nothing."

"I don't think it's anything, what's wrong with you these last few days, eat something."

Ellen Artorius.

You can use Ellen to bring the demon down.

I was confident in my thinking.

So I thought it was just a matter of running it.

I didn't think I could take him down lightly.

So I took only the best of the Immortals, and waited for a time when there were no outside eyes.

But instead of subduing Ellen in a blind spot, the immortal was sliced to pieces.

Then, after subduing Christina, Ellen seemed to hesitate for a moment. She put Christina down and walked away.

It didn't put up even the slightest resistance.

It's true that Immortal was defeated because Ellen was strong.

But it's not because Ellen is strong that Christina can't resist.

Christina felt it in her skin that she had been too complacent about the fight.

You don't even need the same Battlemage.

It doesn't even need to be enchanted.

Even if she was asked to fight a single strong soldier, she realized that she was weak enough to be helplessly killed.

Creating an immortal doesn't make her stronger.

I was deluded into thinking that because I held the power, I was stronger.

But there's more to it than regretting such misery and arrogance.

In the days that followed, the moment I was choked by Ellen became a nightmare and haunted my dreams, but that's not the point.

'It's not human....... It's not human.'

While trying to take Ellen hostage, I realized something very strange.

Ellen's voice.

An eerie voice that could never be human.

I felt the kind of pain I've never felt before, like tens of thousands of people talking at the same time, like my soul was being torn apart just listening to it.

Ellen hasn't lost her flavor.

It's not something that can be expressed at that level.

Ellen has become something other than human.

It's dangerous, scary, and terrifying all at the same time.

Something that has any will of its own.

'This is dangerous....... This is, this is dangerous.'

Originally, they wanted to kill the demon, to capture Ellen to draw out the demon.

However, in her arrogance, Christina made the mistake of getting in Ellen's face and provoking her.

However, that mistake proved to be a good thing in hindsight.

The most dangerous things right now are not demons, empires, or immortals.

It's not even a gate situation.

A sword that cuts through anything.

A cloak that shields you from any attack.



Ellen Artorius, holding the two holy relics, was swallowed by something strange.

Christina paid the price for her arrogance and mistakes.

And it taught me something I needed to know.

Right now, the most dangerous person is no one else but Ellen Artorius.

Now that she's been favored once, she's not going to put herself out there.

Just because you're not used to fighting doesn't mean you're going to go the Battlemage route now.

As usual, you just need to act in a thematically appropriate way, with the Immortal in the foreground and only giving commands from behind.

She believes she's already dealt with the Scarlett threat.

But other threats.

What to do with Ellen, who shreds her immortal like a piece of paper?

Is there anyone in the world who can take on Ellen?

What the hell has Ellen Artorius become.

What the heck do you want.

But the obvious.

Ellen, who had become something unknown, clearly said so.

It's still useful, so I'm not going to kill it.

Even with Immortal's armies in place, Ellen can still advance through their saturation and attacks.

If anyone can actually do it, it's Ellen.

That means that when it's all said and done, we're going to kill Christina because we don't care what happens to the immortal.

Ellen doesn't speak for the empire or the devil.

That's why Ellen is the only one who can be driven to exterminate Immortals without regard to the interests of the world, and why she has no qualms about killing Christina.

Only then does Christina realize the strength of Ellen Artorius that she has only heard about.

People take it for granted that warriors are allies.

That's why we can only admire the strength of the warrior.

But I can't imagine what would happen if that Ellen Artorius became an enemy.

But she saw it with her eyes.

When the warrior becomes the enemy, no one can stop him.

I watched as no army, no sword, no magic worked.

Ellen was better when she had some semblance of humanity left.

Ellen Artorius was crumbling under the weight of her guilt, but because she was human, she was able to communicate with it, to touch it and make it back down.

However, there's no conversation.

For example.

What if your warrior has become a monster?

Humanity has developed weapons to end the gate crisis.

It's not Titan, it's not Immortal.

Humanity's greatest weapon has been in human hands ever since the Gate.

Ellen Artorius was humanity's greatest weapon.

But the weapon is now, well, a weapon.

The dehumanized warrior may still be on the side of humanity, but he's not on Christina's side.

From the start, they were never meant to be used as bait.

We don't know if Ellen is a threat to humanity, but to Christina, she is.

"I have to kill Ellen.

The unknown is, in and of itself, the biggest threat.

If I don't get rid of Ellen, it might ruin everything.

She begins to dwell on it.

"Christina, come on, something's going on, don't keep it to yourself, talk to me."

However, no one would agree that Ellen should be killed.

She couldn't get the thought out of her mouth.

The Allies have now begun their advance to the final objective, Diane.

Will the gate crisis end, or will humanity end?

Under normal circumstances, an army's combat power should diminish as it marches. In a bizarre twist, however, the Union army's combat power grew exponentially with each battle.

This has been the case primarily since the introduction of Titan, and secondarily since the arrival of Immortal.

As the Gate situation grew more and more dangerous, the Allies were growing stronger.

Everyone knows who the Titans are.

A giant golem created by the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan and the Temple's genius wizards.

But with the second power, everyone saw it, but no one knew what it was.

It might be a good thing that the imaginary force was part of the Allied forces, but in the end, unless you knew what it was, you were bound to be secretly terrified.

But those who know the truth can't keep their mouths shut forever.

It was inevitable that there would be stories spreading throughout the Allied ranks, stories whose origins were unknown.

A powerful army whose identity is unknown, the Undead Legion was created by the Empire from the bodies of its fallen.

That's why all the troops are wearing armored helmets that cover their faces, or robes that cover their faces.

He's bundled up because he's afraid someone might recognize his face in that helmet or robe.

The story of an emperor who tapped into a forbidden power to end a war.

Truths that are true but too good to be true spread like wildfire.

The rumors didn't stop there.

Stories spread of traitors within the Alliance, of those who had sworn allegiance to the Devil.

The emperor has his hand in the liquor.

Those who swear allegiance to the Demon King are emerging from the Alliance.

As the Allies headed into the final battle, they were plagued by two bizarre rumors that threatened to shake the entire Alliance.

And finally.

Another piece of news spreading through those who are forced to travel in and out of the ecliptic for supply reasons.

Rumors were even spreading in the zodiac that the Gate was actually caused by the Emperor, not the Devil.

-Nonsense.

-What's wrong with you, Emperor?

Unsurprisingly, few believed the rumors.

-With so many people starving in the zodiac, you have no one to blame but yourself.

-Yes. Last time I heard there was some kind of a big ruckus and a lot of people died, that must have been it.

-If something breaks in the first place, it's your fault.

Most people didn't believe the rumors.

But rumors are fleshed out and mixed up.

First rumor.

An army made of the dead.

Second rumor.

Those who have sworn allegiance to the demon.

Third rumor.

Rumors that the Emperor was responsible for Gate.

Some people don't believe in rumors, but others are susceptible to them.

And for those with a weakness for rumors, they combine them.

-But....... If it's true that His Majesty the Emperor caused the Gate crisis, then....... What the hell is a demon?

-Don't say anything crazy, you're going to get in trouble.

-No....... That's weird....... Doesn't it make sense that the Devil would leave us alone all this time in the first place....... Don't you think it doesn't make sense?

The behavior of a demon that hadn't attacked humanity until now.

It was already becoming something of a rationale in itself.

Assumptions that people haven't made before are crystallized in bizarre and overly credulous rumors.

-Think about it, if the Devil really wanted to wipe out the humans, he could have done it. He could have targeted us somewhere else, not here. The question is, why doesn't he?

In ordinary terms, it didn't make sense that the human race was still alive.

But so far, no one has thought of it, or if they have, they haven't said it out loud.

But the moment you start mentioning his name, it gets out of hand.

There was talk of demons all over the Allied camp.

-Isn't it true that you're not really interested in destroying humans or anything like that?

-Nonsense! Didn't the Devil attack the Yellow City the last time? He....... I heard he ravaged the Imperial City at the time of the Empress's execution.

-No. As far as I know, he only took the Empress with him, and I don't think anyone else died.

-I heard thousands burned to death?

-Was anyone in the ecliptic at the time?

Eventually, rumors breed speculation, and speculation masquerading as fact becomes another rumor, circling the drain.

In the end, it all comes down to suspicion.

Why the devil leaves humanity alone.

That the Devil caused the Gate Crisis in order to destroy humanity has been an unquestioned assumption until now.

But what's the next step?

While the Demon is thought to have disappeared, there was a time in the not-too-distant past when the Demon appeared at the execution of the Empress.

It's not like there weren't people who saw the fight firsthand.

It's unclear if it was the Imperials or someone else, but the demon appeared and slaughtered the Swordmasters and Archmages, before being stabbed through the heart by the hero who finally showed up and disappeared.

-Wasn't the king, in fact, dead by then......?

-No way he's that dead.......

There was even talk that the demon might have actually died at that moment.

Is the devil long dead?

-No, what about the traitors who are now siding with the devil now that he's dead?

-Right?

People are confused because they can't tell where the rumors are true and where they are false.

That's why rumor mongers are created.

People who pick up scattered stories and create their own truths are everywhere.

The Devil has no intention of destroying humanity in the first place. This is evidenced by the fact that he hasn't attacked humanity so far.

The Gate debacle was an accident or conspiracy caused by the Emperor through some means, and the Devil was blamed for it.

When some of the Allied leaders learned the truth, they sided with the Devil when they realized the real culprit was the Emperor.

So, in a moment of crisis, the Emperor began to steal the bodies of the fallen and create an army of the undead. To defend the empire and himself.

It's a story that has nothing to do with the facts.

There is no explanation of what the Emperor has to gain by causing the gate, or if he has caused the gate, why he would want to organize an alliance to end it.

Even the backstory of how the Immortals came first and the Devil's supporters came about is reversed.

At the end of the day, a story that sounds good is more convincing.

After all, just as the story that started with the premise that the devil was evil won people's trust.

It's only now that a story that started with the premise that the emperor was evil is starting to gain credibility.

Some stories are easier for people to believe if they have someone who is absolutely wrong.

Not surprisingly, there are many who dismiss such stories as nonsense.

Most importantly, people are starting to have a disbelief problem.

When a rumor is overblown, it is inevitable that some small part of it will be treated as true, even if only a few people believe the overblown rumor.

Few people believe in the truth of the fabrication.

However, as far as the source of the rumor goes, I'm inclined to believe it's true.

The emperor has created an army of the dead.

The Devil is intervening in the Alliance.

There are some Alliance leaders who have sided with the Devil.

Demons have not attacked humanity since the Gate, not even once.

Those four truths, they get stuck in people's heads.

When a rumor is blown out of proportion, it makes people realize that it's only as good as its source, whether they believe it or not.

Really, did the devil cause Gate?

If the Devil didn't cause the Gate, it makes sense that he hasn't touched humanity until now.

In fact, if the Devil caused the Gate, it's hard to see how he could have kept humanity alive this long.

In fact, outside of the Gate incident, there was no mention of the demon directly exterminating people or destroying human cities.

Just like that.

The Allies advance on Diane amidst the chaos.

With the underlying confusion of not knowing who to hate.

And just like that, we're on our way to the final battlefield.

"That's the maximum charge anyway, no need for more."

Redina said, looking at Kaier Biorden sitting in the Arc Crystal Chamber.

"I know that."

It is Redina's job to draw energy from the Arc Crystal, where Kaier's energy is stored.

However, ever since she realized that Kai'er was very weak after all the fighting, Redina hasn't bothered to ask him about the Arc Crystal.

Suddenly, she understood.

Kaier realizes that, in the first place, he was doing what he had to do, whether Redina told him to or not.

So, without Redina's urging or prodding, Kai did his job, and without being told to please stop.

"You're just sitting there draining your energy. I told you not to come in here when you're not charging."

When a person reaches a state of extreme disenchantment, they die.

The source of life is being depleted.

By now, Redina was more aware of how debilitated Kaier was than Kaier himself.

But as the battle continued, the relationship, which wasn't all that great to begin with, became completely strained.

It's the only thing I can do, and if I don't do it, what will I do?

Torn apart by Redina's verbal assault, Kaier's self-esteem was shattered and he clung to the only thing he could do.

Even when Redina apologizes with remorse, even when she pleads, Kaier doesn't listen.

"I'm not trying to do that."

"What do you do?"

What are you doing in front of an arc crystal that is already fully charged?

Redina, who had told him not to come out of his room, was now the most anxious because she knew what her behavior was doing to Kai'er's body.

"I'm not good with magic, but I can put magic into an arc crystal, so I was trying to see if I could control the rate at which I put it in."

"......."

The only thing you can do.

Kaier seemed to be trying to see if something else was possible for him.

I broke it.

Redina couldn't help but watch Kai'er's face, her eyes wide.

"But that doesn't work. Arc Crystal doesn't give me mana, it takes it away."

I'm not giving it to you, the arc crystal is taking it.

Kaeir smiles bitterly as he finally admits that he doesn't know and leaves the chamber.

"Adelia must be amazing to create something like this."

A tremendous talent, born with a tremendous amount of power.

But the inability to maneuver magic.

Redina bit her lip as she watched Kaier self-deprecate that he was nothing, but that he was useful because of his brilliant classmate.

All of Kaier's self-help advice was once said by Redina.

You say he's an idiot with nothing but a lot of horsepower.

He would scowl at me if I made eye contact, telling me to stop playing and charge my arc crystals.

The sight of those you couldn't save because you didn't have enough magic in each battle.

Because of the sight of people dying, not by one or two, but by the hundreds.

I can't help but think that it was due to a single disloyal person.

So far, we've wounded Kaier.

Kaier doesn't deny the hurt he felt.

What Redina has been saying, she now says herself.

I'm useless.

That's all you can do.

That's what I say to myself now.

Redina looks at Kaier and lowers her eyes.

"Can we talk for a second?"

Gone are the days of always speaking in commands and screaming.

Redina now tries to be as polite as possible to Kaier.

The truth is, Kaeir wasn't really paying attention to his tone.
