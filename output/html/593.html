Ellen was granted access to the case with the Crusader Chief's order to fully cooperate.

And while not officially part of the investigation, Louise von Schwarz was also working on the case as Ellen's assistant.

Heinrich then formed the opinion that Satanists might be involved in the case.

Unlike the Warrior Cultists, the Demon Cultists use the divine power of demons, and some of them are dangerous. So if there really was a demonic force, they could have robbed the underground of the Crusaders' Great Hall, and they could have killed Rowen, who was after them.

Ludwig says with a stern look.

"I heard from Rowen....... because the warrior cults are not considered heretics....... There are real cults that masquerade as warrior cults."

"...... should be good enough."

Louise nodded at Ludwig's words.

Mercenary religions have no roots and are not a cohesive force, so their beliefs often have different contexts.

It's also possible that they're spreading their beliefs disguised as warrior religions to the refugee camps.

And unlike the warrior religions, the Demon Gods are a collective force.

"If it were possible, a demonic religion masquerading as a warrior religion could have nearly ruled the refugee camps."

It's entirely possible that they're not just a creeping force, but that they're already the dominant religious force in the entire refugee camp, albeit in the guise of a warrior religion.

"Then again....... that a man named Rowen may have been fighting a monster of unimaginable size......."

If it's true that the refugee camps have been infested with demonic beliefs masquerading as warrior religions, then Rowen has been wandering the streets of the camps in an attempt to uncover the true nature of the great demonic cults.

If he was indeed capturing and interrogating Satanists and not innocent refugees, Rowen may have been seeking his own brand of justice after all.

The people Rowen captured, tortured, and killed were either Satanists or innocents.

It was getting to the point where I couldn't tell if what Rowen was doing was good or bad.

In the end, we don't know what Rowen's true intentions were, or who killed him, so we're left with a lot of possibilities, but nothing is certain.

Ellen drums her fingers on the table, which is littered with speculation.

"First, I think we should go to the cemetery of the saints."

Incident scene.

I'd better go there, Ellen concluded.



* * *



The theft of the remains from the Cemetery of the Saints was not the trigger for all of this.

Rowen was a heresy inquisitor for the Eclipse, and he'd been at it a long time.

She must have had her own goals.

We don't know if it's a matter of identifying and eradicating demonic religions, or uprooting them entirely.

There have been extreme incidents since Gate.

Just because a bomb goes off doesn't mean it's the cause of everything.

In a world where gunpowder is everywhere, it's only a matter of time before there's a big explosion.

The problem is gunpowder.

With so many problems in the world, it's only a matter of time before the Demon Gods take over, the Warrior Gods overtake the Great Gods, and hunger and plague become a problem.

Gates are the cause of everything, and accidents are everywhere.

The theft of the saints' graves, the theft of their relics, were just a bunch of problems that met a trigger and exploded.

That's what Ellen was thinking.

The Knights Templar is also investigating the incident.

"I don't think Rowen shared the investigation with the Crusaders. Either that, or the leader lied."

Rowen would have launched an investigation immediately after the incident.

He returned to the Crusaders with a group of high-ranking paladins, but they dismissed him as knowing nothing about Rowen's investigation.

With no way of knowing if the crusader leader was cooperating, Ellen had no way of getting to the truth of the matter except to see, hear, and judge with her own eyes.

The Crusader leader can lie to Ellen or withhold information from her, but he can't block her path.

Ellen communicated her need to see the scene, and soon enough, Elayon Bolton assigned her a high-ranking paladin to serve as her escort.

"Greetings, warrior. It is an honor to meet you. Let me show you around."

"Yes, thank you."

Ellen didn't have much faith in him, as the leader would be no different than the master.

Ellen leads the group to the basement of the Crusader High Hall.

There are many facilities underground at the Great Hall, but the Cemetery of the Saints is the deepest.

The paladins blocking the way had been instructed to do so, and when they saw Ellen, they moved out of the way.

Louise agrees to help Ellen and Ludwig, but holds back.

It's up to Ellen to take matters into her own hands.

"Can you give us a brief overview of the case?"

"The incident happened on December 3, so about 17 days ago."

An incident that occurred 17 days ago.

The Crusader Templar could not return immediately, so he would have to wait until long after the event to return to the Imperium.

So it's understandable that we didn't know what the status of the investigation was or how it was progressing.

The content was clear and simple.

In the early morning hours of December 3, an administrative priest in charge of the tomb of the saints entered the tomb of the saints and, upon seeing the destruction, immediately reported to the priest on duty.

When the on-call priests and paladins arrived and checked the scene, they found that many of the sarcophagi had been destroyed and the remains missing.

"What was the security situation?"

"The Tomb of the Saints was originally....... However, due to its location, descending to the Tomb of the Saints will inevitably draw the attention of paladins and priests, though......."

"Did anyone see the culprit?"

"Yes."

"What about locks?"

"The entrance to the tombs of the saints is locked in peacetime. The only people with keys are the priests in charge of administration. However, when we interrogated the priests in charge of administration, it turned out that they were keeping the keys in their private rooms."

"You mean ...... could have been stolen?"

"Someone may have been using it on the sly."

There are thieves who steal from graves that have nothing to steal.

Inevitably, the priests in charge of the tomb would be severely punished.

And the suspicion that you might be a suspect.

"According to the priest who discovered the scene, the tomb was locked as usual."

"You mean the burglar got away with kicking in the door?"

"......We don't know that."

That's ridiculous.

During the descent into the catacombs, the perpetrators were never seen, and the doors were locked.

While we can't completely rule out the possibility of key mismanagement or insiders, there are two most likely explanations.

You may have entered the catacombs by teleporting.

"It's possible that a high-level wizard was involved."

It's likely that a mage with access to teleport, or better yet, mass teleport, was involved.

"The Knights are looking at that possibility as well, and you'll see when you get there."

When they reached the Cemetery of the Saints, the paladin in charge of the group inserted a large key into the massive entrance and unlocked it.

-Greg

A paladin single-handedly opens a door that no ordinary man can properly open. It was a giant door that a normal person would have trouble pushing or pulling.

Soon the door opened, and Ellen could see the scene preserved exactly as it had been on the day of the incident.

A giant underground cavity.

And there were sarcophagi embedded in the walls, as well as sarcophagi buried in the floor.

Some sarcophagi were intact, but many were shattered.

And the debris on the floor.

"That's not theft, that's vandalism."

"Yes....... Yes."

"How can there be this level of disturbance and not be heard from above?"

"It must have been heard, but none of the priests upstairs heard it."

Noise suppression.

And spatial movement.

Louise says as she stares at the scene.

"That's noise canceling."

I was convinced that the wizard was inevitably involved.



* * *



"Can I come in and take a look?"

"Yes, anytime."

Ellen walked slowly into the catacombs.

The Crusaders don't keep Ellen well informed, but they don't stop her either.

Beyond that, only the people in the room will be able to figure it out and make judgments.

Cemetery of Saints.

Ellen didn't know about these places, and she didn't need to.

Ludwig, Heinrich, and Louise followed Ellen into the catacombs.

We don't know for sure if the temple raiders and the ashes thieves are the same.

However, it's clear that there were superhumans among those who raided the temple, and mages among those who stole the remains.

Everyone had a hunch that whatever type of group the perpetrators were, they weren't normal people.

There were sarcophagi buried in the ground, and sarcophagi embedded in the walls as if they were housed.

Like a cabinet, for example.

We don't know if the thief was alone or in a group, but the sarcophagus was mostly broken.

No matter how much noise canceling you've done to suppress it, it's just too harsh. It's literally destructive.

"There's a lot of ways to do it gently, like steal the ashes and put the coffin back.

Had they done so, the Crusaders would have been unaware for a very long time that the remains had been stolen.

One thing is clear: the thieves acted as if they didn't care if they were caught or not.

"They were confident that they wouldn't get caught doing this.

Maybe it's a dig at the Crusaders, maybe it's confidence that they won't get caught. Or both, we don't know.

We've all been there, done that, but there are still things we don't know.

Why I took it.

Why would they steal the remains? Leaving them defaced would have shown their anger at the Crusaders or their anger at the High Priestess.

'Fury......?

Rage against the Five Great Houses.

And that anger is most pronounced against two of the five major denominations.

Tuan and Als.

And while many of the sarcophagi were destroyed, others were intact.

Some bodies were taken, some were not.

"Did they only take the remains of the saints who believed in Tuan and Als in life?

Ellen reads the bio from a fragment of a destroyed sarcophagus.

"No.

I scanned the names just in case, but there were paladins from Riter, Mensis, and Shalam, as well as the remains of paladins who believed in Tuan and Als in life.

"There's no distinction.

This could be an act of rage, or it could be a faction that hates all of the Five Great Houses.

As she scrolled through the names, she couldn't help but notice one she recognized.

"This is......."

Ellen couldn't help but roll her eyes.

Reinhard, who was murdered by Leverier Ranze.

Ellen had to bite her lip when she saw the name.

At the time of the Miss Temple contest, Reinhardt did not show up.

It was then that Reinhardt fought Leviathan to save Olivia Ranze.

At the sudden recollection, Ellen felt an excruciating headache engulf her.

"Ugh......!"

"Ellen!"

Suddenly, Ellen faltered, holding her head in her hands, and Heinrich and Ludwig, who had been looking around, and Ellen, as well as the paladin who had been watching, rushed to her aid.

"Ugh......!"

It felt like a thousand needles piercing my head.

"What's going on, are you okay?"

"Warrior! Are you all right!"

"Go, what's wrong with you all of a sudden......!"

"Are you okay? Wake up!"

With the voices echoing around her and the pressure threatening to overwhelm her, Ellen squeezes her eyes shut and tries to catch her breath.

The sudden onslaught of names and memories made Ellen feel like an awl was being dug into her brain.

The hatred and anger of others, unknown in origin, threatens to consume you.

The presence of "it" in her soul, threatening to consume her at any moment, weighs on Ellen's psyche.

A tidal wave of souls that had been dormant because your mind was elsewhere.

Today I was confronted with so many things I've been trying to forget, including the demons and the gate situation.

And so the torrent of souls that had barely been quenched threatens to overwhelm Ellen.

"Hey, it's okay....... I'm fine....... I just got a little dizzy......."

It was by no means what you'd describe as vertigo, but Ellen had to hold her head steady and catch her breath.

Not yet.

Not yet.

We can hold on for now.

Not yet.

You can be calm.

I can't hand over my body, mind, and spirit yet.

You need to think about something else.

Just thinking about the devil and thinking about Reinhardt felt like my soul was being torn apart.

Ellen clutches the bone idol around her neck.

Holding on to the signpost of the heart that the Detomorian had carved out.

Returns.

Forget about it.

You'd rather forget about it so it doesn't get taken away from you.

Focus on the incident.

Levereer Ranze had his remains stolen.

I must see an end to this bizarre murder and carnage.

You need to know where all this is going.

In the midst of those thoughts.

Ellen thinks of something else.

No murders, no demons, no gates, no stolen remains.

The one word that will make you forget everything that's cluttering your mind.

Go back.

Go back to the template.

You need to feed the cat.

Like a lie.

"Ha ha....... Ha ha......."

The pain that felt like it was ravaging my head and soul stopped.

"......."

Ellen stood still for a moment, wondering why the pain had stopped for this reason.



* * *



"Maybe there's some kind of unclean energy in this place, and it's affecting you......."

"No, no. That's not it, I just do that sometimes."

To everyone's concern, Ellen assured them that it wasn't.

An investigation is an investigation, but the most important thing is Ellen's life. Even a paladin would be white with panic.

Ellen needs to put herself first, and that's what everyone else thinks.

"There's nothing urgent, so I think you should go back and rest."

That's why Louise suggested that we call it a day and go back to the template to organize our thoughts.

Ellen wanders through the catacombs.

The sarcophagi were destroyed, and the snow gave us some clues about the thieves.

Although we still don't know why it was stolen.

And Ellen's heart skipped a beat.

Fear that the spirits that have been lying dormant lately might swallow you whole.

"Okay, I don't think there's anything more I can find out here, so I'll send it to......."

That's why Ellen agreed with Ruiz. We don't know where these clues will lead, but they've been checked.

"Hey, by the way......."

But Ludwig was hesitant to leave, as if he had a question.

"Did you notice anything unusual?"

At Louise's question, Ludwig shook his head with an ambiguous expression.

"What? Ah....... I had a question for you......."

"What is it?"

Everyone follows Ludwig when he says he has a question.

Ludwig heads toward the wall of the catacombs.

Where the broken sarcophagi are.

"You mean this coffin....... How did they break it?"

"......?"

"How?"

"......?"

Ludwig's question left the other three puzzled.

Just as Ellen did, and just as the paladins did.

Everyone was focused on the destruction itself. I wondered why I'd bothered to trash this catacomb when I could have stolen it quietly and gone undetected.

I focused on the "why" I broke it, not the "how" and there was no reason to.

What's the point?

"Why is that all of a sudden?"

At Heinrich's question, Ludwig looks at the shattered sarcophagus.

The inside of the shattered sarcophagus looked like a gaping hole.

Ludwig looks at the blank wall and says, "I'm sorry.

"I thought you said you didn't clean up the scene."

"Yeah, I said yes."

Ludwig peers into the hole and raises his left fist.

"You know, like a fist or something....... If you smashed it with something like that and took it out like this....... Shouldn't there be a piece of stone inside?"

Ludwig's questions prompt Ellen to look inside the sarcophagus.

It's not like breaking rocks for beginners.

I took a deliberately abrasive approach, and I didn't have to worry about noise because of noise canceling.

You punch the sarcophagus with your fist, shattering it. The force is applied from the outside in.

If so, stone dust or debris would have gotten inside the coffin.

The sarcophagus wasn't completely devoid of stone dust, debris, and stones, but it was certainly unusual.

There are too few traces of it.

The same was true for the other sarcophagus.

But there are too many fragments of sarcophagi on the ground, and they are far apart.

Ludwig looks at the other sarcophagus.

"This is something....... from the inside out, don't you think?"

"!"

"Such......!"

Louise and Ellen couldn't help but notice something.

Certainly the debris strewn about the scene speaks for itself.

The force was applied from the inside out.

"How can you break it like that......?"

"Bodies."

"Huh?"

Ellen answers Ludwig's question.

"I brought it back to life."

Ellen says, eyes wide.

"The bodies of the saints....... to the undead......."

The body reanimated itself and broke the sarcophagus to escape.

There was no reason to think about why I'd smashed it like that.

Given how I broke it, it was easy to see what was going on here.

They are not others, but the bodies of saints honored by the Crusader Knights.

Someone reanimated them as the undead, and they disappeared.

The ashes were not stolen, they were resurrected.

At that shocking conclusion, Ellen, Ludwig, who had hinted at it, Louise and Heinrich could only stand by and watch.
