That night, I got the handwriting comparison results.

To everyone's surprise, it was Ellen's.

But since the action had already begun, the handwriting was merely reaffirming.

The border blockade had already begun, and the emperor was almost ready to march.

The announcement came as a surprise to the people of the Zodiac, as well as all the dignitaries and Imperial nobility.

The New Empire confirms the arrival of Ellen Artorius in the northeastern region of Cernstadt.

All borders in the northeastern district of Cernstadt are currently closed.

And the devil himself is out to hunt for heroes.

The dreaded name and enemy of the empire.

Abolitionists and warriors.

The Emperor himself has declared that one of them will now be hunted.

It was a big move, indeed.

The best and brightest of the imperial army were summoned, including the Cernstadt army and the Zodiacal standing army.

Many watched as the massive army disappeared from the ecliptic in one fell swoop through the massive mass teleportation manifested by the Archmage.

People were overwhelmed by the magic of the Archmage, who had become a living legend.

Naturally, the mass movement was quickly spread across the entire ecliptic, with people traveling to and from all continents through warp gates set up in the ecliptic.

Within days, word spread across the continent that the emperor had begun a hunt for heroes.

Unlike before, the devil himself is in the details.

This has never happened before.

So everyone would know it was real this time.

It's been a long, long love-hate relationship.

However, something has changed from the past.

No one thought of the emperor's defeat.

A warrior with nothing.

The emperor who has it all.

It's pretty obvious how the fight will end.

Naturally, the word spread to the territories.

The warrior cultists were both pleased and dismayed that the missing warrior was alive.

The warrior would not win, for those who hated the demon knew best.

They have watched, heard, or actually experienced the carnage of the demigod called Mushin from afar.

An army has been defeated by a single demon and has fled, and the place where they have gathered is a territory.

In their learned fear and despair, they are forced to admit that if it were not for the mercy of the Devil, the Autonomy would not exist.

So they believe in the warrior, but in the end they can only weep when they realize that the luck granted by the heavens to the warrior has come to an end.

"Assimilation Column Overview."

"Yes, here."

Ellen accepted an apple from the market and popped it into her mouth.

-Square

The sweetness spreads with a cheerful sound.

It was a sweetness she hadn't tasted in a long time, and it sent shivers down her spine. It was a sensation she hadn't felt in a long time, and she shivered as she walked down the street.

Civilization is only appreciated by those who have been away from it for a long time.

That you can eat an apple you didn't grow or harvest yourself.

That it can be done for a few fairy tales.

You might think you want to eat apples in a field, but you'd be a fool to actually go looking for them.

It's ridiculous to think of apples when we'd be grateful to find an edible tree or grass root.

But in the city, a few fairy tales can make it happen.

Despite her newfound gratitude, Ellen doesn't stop to look around.

Wearing a hood or covering your face doesn't exactly raise suspicion. Ellen isn't the only one who does that.

Compared to previous eras, the New Empire is still unstable, and crime rates are nowhere near as high as they were in previous eras. As a result, many people are wanted, and many have hidden identities.

Ellen is bold enough to enter the city because the New Empire is unstable.

Of course, if you get stopped, you're in trouble.

Ellen walks along the edge of the path and slices an apple.

There was no such thing as money.

Luckily for Ellen, however, she encountered a mugger on her way into town.

For others, it would be a misfortune, but for Ellen, it was the luck of the draw.

The robbers were fortunate enough to give Ellen what they had.

One gold coin, ten silver coins, and thirty fairy tales, but they were all in Ellen's bank account.

The robbers didn't know who Ellen was, and she was beaten and knocked out, so it's unlikely her identity was discovered.

So, for the first time in a very long time, Ellen is able to beam with gratitude and apologize to the muggers who tried to rob her.

The only reason I came into the city, rather than the outskirts, was because I needed information.

-They say a warrior has appeared in the northeast.

-Ah, she's lying again. How many people have you seen in this neighborhood?

-No, this time it's different, the devil himself is out in force.

-What?

-Yes. If it's a demon that hasn't moved before, it must be something.

-Here....... And what happens to the transaction?

-I don't know. The Imperial Knights, the Archmages, they're all scrambling to find heroes. They've got their entire border sealed off. They can't move an ant, and they're doing a lot of checkpoints.

-Getty Images....... Something's happened to me...I've got a hard-on.......

-But a warrior is a warrior, why get caught for nothing?

-The king is a godless man. Didn't you hear about the battle on the Meilan Plains?

-You think that's true? It's all a lie.

-Of course it's true, those battle veterans can't sleep at the sound of your name.

-I want it to make sense. No matter how great a demon is, how can he fight a war alone?

-That's why he's a demon!

From the many stories she hears on the street, Ellen picks out the information she needs.

Ellen had an inkling of what her actions would cause.

But he decided it was information he needed to share urgently, even if it meant letting them know he'd come out of nowhere.

If we don't take action at the national level, if we don't do something about it, it's going to spiral out of control.

As a result, however, the northeastern border of Cernstadt was completely sealed.

We don't know how wide the Empire's blockade will be, but it will probably be impossible to penetrate.

Importantly, Cernstadt had more territory than the Empire.

If the Imperial and Cernstadt armies can be brought to bear, we should be able to establish a blockade that completely seals off the northeastern borderlands.

But she knew she couldn't afford more, and that's true.

Despite the circumstances, Ellen is in town for a reason.

You can't get information in no-man's land.

You don't know if you've really been compromised, or what the military is doing.

So I had to get into the city to get a sense of the situation.

And second.

Right now, Ellen is not in northeastern Cernstadt.

Ellen wasn't getting out of Cernstadt, she was getting deeper into it.

We were headed to the southwest, which is the complete opposite of the area with the roadblocks and constant stop-and-frisk.

So now the army was blockading the wrong place.



* * *



After submitting her materials to the Adventurers' Guild of Velothia, Ellen made a hasty exit from the city.

And I ran like crazy.

Heading southwest, not northeast, to enter Cernstadt, the closest country to the no-man's land.

Regardless of the reasonableness of the information, everyone knows it's suspicious.

Ellen knew that if she tried to get out of Cernstadt the way she came in, she'd end up in the middle of a sealed border zone.

Whatever it is you're trying to catch, you can't be caught now after running away for so long.

That's why Ellen chose to go deeper.

In the opposite direction from where the barrier is installed.

I took the risk of entering the city and found that the cordon had been set up in the Northeast, as expected.

Of course, if nothing is found on the cordon for a long period of time, it may be predicted that you have actually entered Cernstadt.

So you can't slow down. We just need to get to the border of the Southwest Region as quickly as possible.

Your side of the border may be blocked as well, but you don't have to cross it.

We have the information we need.

So there's no need to stay in the city longer.

So Ellen makes her way out of town, discreetly but quickly.

And when you finally made it out of the city safely and took the last bite of the apple.

-Wasak

"......."

I should have bought another one.

and.

Ellen regretted it very briefly.



* * *



Ellen ran off the beaten path.

Running on the road is naturally suspicious when someone sees you, so I ran through uninhabited forests and mountains.

There's no time to lose, and the Empire isn't stupid, so it's a no-brainer that Ellen won't be where the cordon is set up.

So you should definitely run Cernstadt at a fast pace where you can run.

You're doing something that's pretty much across the entire country.

No monster hunting, no tracking, just movement.

We passed by some cities, but had no choice but to enter others.

We had to keep up with the shifting tides of the Empire in real time.

In the days that passed as Ellen fled in the opposite direction, stories of the warrior's appearance had already spread throughout Cernstadt.

Not just Cernstadt, but the entire continent would now have its eyes on northeastern Cernstadt.

Whether the hero will be caught or not. Whether the Demon will finally end his tiresome relationship with the Hero.

There was a lot of debate going on.

Even within Cernstadt territory, there were those who said that this time the demon would be slain by a warrior.

Ellen wasn't interested in individual opinions.

The truth mixed in with the opinion.

That the empire is still setting up roadblocks, waiting for the heroes to escape.

That you don't really know where you stand yet.

That was all I needed to know.

Ellen made a quick exit from the city, purchasing only the bare minimum of food and checking in on Imperial troop movements.

The desire to sleep in my bed was like a chimney, but I couldn't even attempt to do anything big.

Ellen was able to travel without horses for distances that could only be covered by riding a horse.

With no sleep, even the superhuman Ellen was bound to be exhausted, but she couldn't let her guard down.

If the Imperials were aware of their movements, they could change their escape route at any moment.

A city that I arrived in after fleeing in the opposite direction and breaking through the center of Cernstadt.

Ellen hadn't gotten any of the dreaded information there, such as that the Empire had noticed her movements.

However, we got something completely unexpected.

-I hear they've captured a warrior.

"......?"

It was a story that Ellen hadn't even guessed.



* * *



The warrior has been captured.

Ellen, a warrior in her own right, was baffled by the story.

I'm here, but who the hell got caught?

It could be a mistake, a misunderstanding, or a rumor. It's not uncommon for people to jump on the bandwagon of an individual rumor.

But everyone I talked to was talking about it.

-That was a hell of a fight, but a warrior's a warrior.

There was even a battle going on.

-But how can you stand against the devil?

-Am. Not even a warrior can reach out an arm to a demon alone, let alone an Archmage.

-Even nowadays, it's said that Archmages are not stronger than demons.......

-should be.......

-ahem. After all, that's what happens.

Some praise the greatness of the demon, while others secretly lament the defeat of the warrior.

Ellen hurried out of the city.

Something.

Things were getting weird.

He was definitely headed southwest of Cernstadt.

But the warrior was captured.

There were even battles of epic proportions between demons and heroes.

Who the hell fought who?

Ellen had no choice but to stop by the city to check on the situation, even as she quickened her pace because of the bizarre rumors.

Countless armies watched the battle between the Demon and the Hero, and the Demon and the Hero bravely fought one-on-one.

I didn't even enlist the help of an Archmage.

At the end of the battle, the story goes, the devil defeated the warrior and sent him back to the Yellow Road.

It couldn't be a rumor. Too many people were saying it.

It was really Ellen Artorius, and that's what was being said.

Ellen couldn't figure out what was going on.

Time passes, and in the next city, Ellen is here, and there's talk about her treatment.

-Public execution.

-Wow, that's a lot of people on the ecliptic.

-You're building a really big firing squad.

A warrior has been defeated by a demon.

You have been transported to the ecliptic.

We're going to do a public execution.

Who did they catch, and what are they trying to do?

Ellen gave up trying to think.

For now, you need to get out of Cernstadt. The good news is that there are no stop-and-frisk checkpoints because of stories of a captured warrior.

You'll get away with it.

And just like that, in the last city you stopped in to almost reach your destination.

-The warrior has been executed.

Ellen couldn't help but realize that the strange show the Empire had put together was coming to an end.

-In the end....... The devil has won.

Under strange circumstances, Ellen walks down the street in a daze.

What are they up to, what's the purpose of this?

Falsely claim to have captured a warrior, and publicly execute the fake warrior.

But Ellen is alive.

No one will seek salvation from Ellen now, as no one will seek a dead warrior.

Is that a consideration?

Didn't you even have any intention of catching me in the first place?

If Ellen accidentally shows up, the public execution will be exposed as a lie, and that's not good for the Demon King's empire.

Executing the Fake Champion may be powerful right now, but Ellen being alive is a flashpoint in itself.

'As it is....... to live away from people forever....... I wonder if that's what he means.......'

It can be both a mercy and a warning.

I'm going to kill it, never to be seen again.

The Emperor's Army was initially meant to be a show, with fake soldiers being captured, imprisoned, and executed.

But why now.

After years of silence, when Ellen didn't show up, why now?

This is the most dangerous time for empire sabotage.

In fact, right now Ellen is in Cernstadt territory.

If she had known that had happened, Ellen would have fled to a place far, far away from the land of men, lest the Empire's fake execution show be discovered to be self-inflicted.

I would have been hesitant to turn over my notes.

We don't know why.

Importantly, the warrior was said to be dead.

I had no intention of going public, but I'm going to have to live a quieter life from now on.

We can't help Reinhardt's empire, but we can't hurt it either.

Does the empire intend to release itself as it is.

So, Ellen walks through the city.

This city is the last stop.

The border in Cernstadt is still a long way off, but the destination is just around the corner.

Ellen wasn't headed to the Cernstadt border post in the first place.

Southwestern tip of Cernstadt.

In such a situation, there's only one step left.

As Ellen walks down the sidewalk, she sees something in an alleyway.

Small animals curled up in the warm sun.

-Angel

-Angel

Four cats were basking in the sun on a corner of the street.

"......."

In the midst of all the weirdness, Ellen couldn't help but smile faintly.

Cat.

It had been a special animal to Ellen for some time.

They've gotten me through some tough and painful times.

Cats are city animals, so you won't see them in the fields.

So, on the rare occasions when she was in the city, she would see one of these cats or another, and Ellen would smile as she remembered those difficult but strangely nostalgic times.

How are we doing?

Such worrisome thoughts naturally come to mind.

I left it in Temple and haven't seen it since.

They come and go.

The child who comes back to you when you think she's gone forever.

I never got around to naming.

The black cat is.

Obviously.

Like that.

It had black, shiny fur.

Of the cats, my eyes naturally gravitate toward the black cat.

The black cat has something around its neck.

I wonder if it's a stray cat.

Or, you've been abandoned.

But the thing around the cat's neck is neither a bell nor a leash.

Ellen's eyes widened.

"......!"

Something round and milky white.

A sculpted moon inside a sun.

That's obvious.

It looked exactly like the amulet Ellen had received from Detomorian.

It's not a lookalike.

It's not the same thing.

Cats too.

Talismans.

is the same as

It looks just like I remember it, and not a bit different.

"You, you....... You....... thou....... you....... here....... Why......?"

Ellen's lips quiver.

In a place where it shouldn't be.

An animal that can't be.

In front of Ellen, wearing a necklace that shouldn't be there.

-Angel

Be still, I cried.
