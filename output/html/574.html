            Episode 574.





The choice to meet Bertus or not was always mine.

Bertus knows I'm helping the Allies advance, but he has no idea where I am, and I can always predict where he will be.

Bertus will be traveling between the three locations.

Tetra, the central palace of Neptune.

Allied Garrison Commander-in-Chief.

And now.

"It's a pretty obvious place, isn't it?"

"Yes, obviously....... I see."

The University of Magic research building in front of me.

Bertus must be traveling to and from one of these three locations.

The Imperial Palace is the Imperial Palace, and the Allied Garrison is the Allied Garrison.

And since there is a very important research project going on in the College of Witchcraft and Wizardry research building, I'm sure I'll be visiting from time to time to keep an eye on things.

"If it's that heavily guarded on the outside, it must be harder to get inside."

No matter how sarcastic you are, no is no.

"Still, rather than risk your Majesty, I would rather......."

"Forget it, how long am I going to have to ask you to do everything for me?"

"That's true, but......."

It's not that I didn't want to do it, but the idea of sending Sarkeghar to the Black Order had long since passed me by.

That doesn't mean Sarkegaard doesn't have a job to do.

Sarkhegar will wait for Bertus to appear nearby.

"Bertus won't attack you anyway, just like he won't attack me. If he shows up here, approach him and tell him I need to talk to him, and then we can talk privately......."

Before I could finish.

In the distance, I could see Bertus and Saviolin Tana exiting the research building.

The fact that I was able to spot them so quickly is more a sign of the emperor's frequent visits than a coincidence.

"Less work."

"Your Highness....... Just one more thought......."

"It's okay."

You can be okay with not being okay.

Leaving a worried Sarkegar behind, I began to approach the research wing of the School of Magic.



* * *



Emperor Bertus does not like to travel with large armies.

Not one to shy away from protocol, Bertus ascended to the throne in a time of crisis. It was a time when such things could not be afforded, so ceremonies were either eliminated or scaled back to the point of excess.

This is not to say that we don't have "lots" of troops, but that we don't value security.

Most of the time, Bertus traveled with the viola tana. That's enough bodyguarding for now.

And when you're going to a place that's supposed to be confidential, you obviously can't take a lot of people with you. So when Bertus is traveling, his bodyguard is always Saviolin Tana, who takes care of everything.

As a result, Xavier Tana has become more than just the head of the Chanapelle, but also the Emperor's personal assistant to some extent.

Of course, when the allied armies are marching or there is a battle, others will take over the guard, but now that he's been hit, Bertus is moving with Savior Tana.

So Bertus stopped by the research wing, and he and Tana were on their way back to the palace.

With so few people inside the temple, the streets were deserted, and Bertus and Saviolin Tana were the only ones walking down the orderly but grimy streets.

"You're on track."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"If it's too smooth, that's a problem."

Bertus smiled bitterly, and Tana stiffened, unable to find the words.

"By the way, I didn't expect the three of you to make this much progress so quickly......."

Bertus sighs.

"No matter how many continents we've gathered from, the Royal Class sophomores are incredibly special."

Adelia, the creator of the Titan and Power Cartridge.

Christina, the creator of Moonshine.

And Louis Ankton and Anna De Guerna.

Emperor.

Empress.

Warriors.

And the devil.

The second year of Royal Class is an uncanny breed. So much so that some powerful destiny is felt.

"What about you, Ludwig, by the way?"

"ah......."

Saviolin Tana's complexion has changed.

"It's....... seems to be having a hard time adjusting."

"......I guess my thinking was short."

When Bertus thought about what Ludwig would face in the Guard, he couldn't help but wonder if he had made a mistake in assigning him to the Guard.

Bertus has a lot of work to do, too. So while he cares about Ludwig, he can't give him the attention he deserves.

"Maybe you should take a job at a training center instead."

"I'll ask Ludwig's doctor."

"Yes, and this time......."

-Angel

Bertus stopped talking at the sound of a cat in the distance.

Neither Tana nor Bertus could do anything but stare at the black cat standing still in the middle of a wide, deserted street.

"Um....... That one?"

"You're a cat."

-Angel

The black cat slowly approaches the emperor.

"It's not just a cat, Lord Tana."

"If you say that's......?"

"Ellen's cat."

"ah......."

"I know it was unavoidable in the garrison, but I'm not sure it's right to let them run loose like this in the temple. I can understand not wanting to keep them locked up......."

"Ugh. I've never had a cat, so I don't know......."

It's even weirder that Savior Tana, who's been holding a sword her whole life, should know how to raise a cat.

"By the way, you've come a long way from your dorm, do you even know how to get back?"

I met a cat wandering around in the middle of nowhere.

Had the cat ever roamed such a large area? Bertus didn't know.

But the black cat is coming toward Bertus.

This is strange, because last time I saw Bertus, he was scrambling to get away.

Bertus squats down to watch the approaching cat.

You might be lost, and Ellen might be worried.

"I think we should take him to the dorms first......."

The moment Bertus reaches out to lift the cat.

Suddenly.

The cat's body began to change.

-Kuruk

"!"

"Your Majesty, it's dangerous!"

Saviolin Tana harshly pulls Bertus away, keeping him at a distance.

The cat turns into something.

And then, in a flash, it took shape, and Bertus and Savior Tana froze in their tracks.

"Well, ....... Not for a long time, to be honest."

Black cat.

"It's been a while. Right?"

Reinhard the Demon appeared.



* * *



Ellen's cat has suddenly turned into a Reinhardt.

There's no way to know why, what the reason is, or what the purpose is.

Even if you don't understand the situation, what you see is what you get.

With Bertus hidden behind her, the pale-faced Saviolin Tana drew her saber.

"Wait. No more, no more approach."

Saviolin Tana's expression was tinged with fear, though not hostility.

Saviolin Tana wasn't the only one caught off guard.

"Reinhard......?"

Bertus swallowed hard, stunned by what was happening in front of him.

"I know you're shocked, but you know you're not here to fight, or you wouldn't have shown up like this."

If you were going to kill it, there were better ways to do it.

There's a reason why we're showing it up front.

"I'd like to talk to you somewhere quiet. It's been a while."

Just as time has changed many things, so has Reinhardt.

"If you stay out there too long like this, you're in trouble. You know that, right?"

The streets were deserted, but it was crazy to wander around the Temple as Reinhardt.

Bertus looks at Reinhardt, who has suddenly appeared, with a stony expression.

"Your Majesty......."

Saviolin Tana also stares at the Emperor with a confused expression.

"Okay. Anywhere is good, so let's go in."

Even the Emperor didn't like it when someone saw a demon in his temple.



* * *



Bertus and Tana are the only ones who know that the demon is helping humanity. That's why they know he's not here to fight when he suddenly reveals himself.

Most of the buildings in Temple were empty, including schools and shops.

So I went to the second floor of a nearby vacant storefront that used to be a cafe.

The door is locked, but that doesn't matter to anyone in the room.

Slashing the lock on the closed door with an auror blade, the three sat down.

The tables and chairs were dusty, but no one seemed to mind.

You only need the space anyway.

"I want to tell you something, but let's not talk about cats because it's not important and I don't want to."

Bertus looked at Reinhardt's vulnerable face and couldn't help but notice how he had changed over the years, if nothing else.

It's even more shameless than before.

"Yeah....... Let's call it that, because it's not like I have any idea why."

You would have wanted to keep an eye on Ellen.

We also learned why Ellen had a seizure when she tried to leave the cat with the emperor.

Reinhardt crosses his arms, muttering to himself.

"Let's not even talk about the good old days. Who did what, where did it go wrong, all that stuff."

Talking about fault is also pointless.

Talking about each other's responsibilities when there's only reality to be faced is only going to make things worse.

The demon warned the emperor that his men would cause a gate crisis if he did not release him, but the emperor refused to release the demon.

That's where the gates came in.

But there's no point in discussing it now.

We have a problem to face, and we have a job to do.

Everything else is pointless except to focus on it.

Bertus nodded at Reinhardt's words.

"You do realize we were clearing a path ahead of the Allies, right?"

"Yeah. I knew that."

Bertus looks at Reinhardt and asks.

"Can you really manipulate the weather?"

"To a limited extent."

Reinhardt doesn't say it's necessarily Liana de Granz's superpower.

Bertus' and Tana's faces hardened at the mention of something no mage could do.

"It's okay, you know what would have happened if you'd tried to use that power to destroy the human race."

"......."

"......."

If a demon were to go on a rampage in the middle of the ecliptic while the Allied forces were in full force, the ecliptic would be devastated.

Now, it's one thing to know that it might happen, but it's another thing to actually have verbal confirmation that the devil can do it if he puts his mind to it.

Humanity should have perished long ago, except for the mercy of the Devil.

But most people hate the devil without even realizing it.

It only takes a day for the Devil to really wipe out the human race, but no one thinks about that.

If the devil threatens the emperor with the very existence of humanity, it is the reality of the empire and of humanity that he must listen, no matter what he says.

However, so far, the Devil has never interfered with humanity in such a way.

"I'm not here to threaten or blackmail you, I'm just here to ask you a question."

Reinhardt asks quietly.

"One of our main sources of power is Death Knight. We used up a lot of it during the Battle of Serandia, so we tried to replenish it last time."

At that, neither Tana nor Bertus are silent, listening to Reinhardt's words.

"That's why I tried to resurrect him as a Death Knight in the Hall of Heroes in the Imperial Mausoleum."

"......what?!"

Bertus and Tana couldn't help but be stunned. To be told that they had tried to break into the imperial mausoleum at such an inopportune time would be astonishing.

"The method is secret, but I got in anyway."

Worse, they've already been breached without realizing it.

Bertus listens to the story with a pale face.

"But....... You see, the coffins are all empty."

"It's not just the imperial mausoleum. I've also confirmed that the bodies of Allied soldiers killed in action are being switched and buried in the national cemetery."

"Just like we tried to make Death Knight, it seems like the Empire is doing some crazy stuff....... I don't know."

"I've been trying to sneak up on them rather than make contact, but I knew I couldn't do that. That's why I came to you."

I'm not going to say, "You shouldn't be doing that, you shouldn't be doing that, you shouldn't be doing that, because I'm doing something similar."

"But you need to know what's what. Because I am, and my people are very uneasy, and you may have aligned yourselves with those who may be my enemies."

"I only have two questions."

The demon stares at the emperor.

"What are you doing at Temple College of Witchcraft and Wizardry?"

The substance of the study.

"You guys are in cahoots with the Black Order."

And suspicious alliances.

"You'll have to explain."

The devil asked two questions.

What research is being done at the Temple School of Magic.

And if they're in cahoots with the Black Order.

There is silence.

Tana couldn't speak before Bertus, so the demon only looked at Bertus.

I don't know if it's before the devil approaches, but the devil asks outright.

Unless you've done something like that, silencing the devil himself is impossible.

"I knew you were watching us, but....... It's kind of weird to realize that."

Bertus said with a bitter smile.

"Yes, we're doing something with the bodies of our fallen heroes."

Bertus nods slowly.

"But I don't know what you mean about the Black Order."

"...... is it?"

The Demon King stays still and watches the Emperor's expression.

It's hard to read intentions from facial expressions.

You can't tell if it's a sham or the truth just by looking at the face.

"They're not working with the Black Order, at least not that I know of."

With that, the Emperor shrugs.

"You don't have to doubt me, you know that, right?"

"What."

"After touching a dead body to end the Gate debacle, what's to say you couldn't recognize the hands of the Black Order, even if they were the ones who tried to kill you?"

It's a weird thing to say what you can and can't do when you're already doing terrible things.

"Are you saying that if the Black Order had come to you, you would have joined hands with them?"

"Yeah. But I didn't, and if I did, I don't think it's in my best interest to put you in this situation in the first place."

"Hmmm......."

In the words of Bertus.

There was nothing the Empire couldn't catch the hands of the Black Order at, with everything they had that could help them. Bertus grinned bitterly at the nervous-looking demon.

"I've found that when I tell the truth, people don't believe me."

Bertus laughed bitterly, saying that when you tell the truth, people doubt you.

"I can at least show you what we were doing."

The demon looked a little surprised, as if he hadn't expected that.
