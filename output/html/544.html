The role is to bird's eye view and support the massive barrage with magic where needed.

It's always been Redina's place, overlooking a huge battlefield, and she should use her own judgment to decide whether or not to support it.

The situation on the battlefield is always changing, so Redina must always use her own judgment.

It's always a decision.

To help or not to help.

Use your telescope magic to see and analyze the battlefield and help where it's needed most.

Helping where it's needed most means not helping in some places.

You need to determine which units are important and which are not.

Let some troops get wiped out and support more important places and more important troops.

Every minute, every second, she has to make the choice between saving someone's life and allowing someone to die.

And the basis for that judgment is intuition. It's not the kind of decision that can be made through meetings and reviews.

Sometimes her biggest fear is that she might be wrong, and she's never been wrong.

Arc Crystal's magic power is not infinite.

That's why there are so many situations where you have to turn someone away.

When she makes a choice to save someone but exclude someone else based on the needs of the battlefield, she can't help but think about the people who are dying because of her decision rather than the ones she saved.

-Currrrr!

As she unleashed dozens of Shockwaves on the swarm of flying monsters flying toward her rear base, neutralizing them, Redina could only watch in disbelief as soldiers were crushed to death by the wreckage of the falling flying monsters.

If we let them get close, the artillery will be neutralized, causing even more damage.

It's a choice, but it doesn't change the fact that the soldiers died because of Redina's magic.

"......."

You may be told that you're the wizard who killed the most monsters.

After all, she's probably the wizard who killed the most people.

Gritting her teeth, Redina looks out over the battlefield.

You have to see a lot of death.

It was a battlefield of death and carnage.

Ludwig was bound to have a place in all that death and carnage.

-Pooh! Pow!

With blue mana covering his body, Ludwig was also slaying monsters.

There are many differences between now and when enchantments were just becoming available.

Due to the optimized hp from Moonshine, Ludwig optimized his hp buffs, as did the rest of the Royal Class.

Even if he didn't make it to the master class, Ludwig is definitely a superhuman.

-Bam!

Stabbing with swords, hitting with pommels, and kicking.

The lesser monsters were neutralized by Ludwig's gestures.

On a battlefield like this, Ludwig's talents are bound to shine.

"Hmph!"

-Scrub!

Don't burn out.

Ludwig had only one talent: physical strength, and he didn't neglect to cultivate it.

But Ludwig can't take on every monster.

-Crunch!

-Oh, help!

All around the battlefield, a frenzied noise of monstrous cries and human screams can be heard.

Of course, they're not the only ones fighting.

-Ah, ahh....... aaaaah.......

Some dropped their weapons and crawled on the ground in terror, having lost their minds.

-legs....... My legs are.......

There were those who were mortally wounded and slowly dying with no help for healing.

In a hell where people are dying at an alarming rate, Ludwig uses the spears and swords of the dead to fight off the waves of monsters.

Why this should happen.

Why this should happen.

Why should they have to die a horrible death.

Ludwig bitterly realizes that he cannot save the fallen, so he does the only thing he can do.

Kills a monster.

That's the only good left in the world. The other line is the one that caused this mess.

It would be the death of a demon.

However, Ludwig is no match for a terrifyingly powerful demon.

That's for the brave.

So kill the monsters.

Killing as many monsters as he can kill, as many monsters as he can face, is the only justice and good that Ludwig can do for himself.

Those who have fallen and groaned, those who have let go of their spirit, but those who still hold their weapons do not let go of their spirit, for they are all thinking like Ludwig.

Those who can't lay down their arms because they're too proud to go down as they are, fight against the disaster.

From afar.

Ludwig saw something leap out from between the waves of monsters.

-huii profit!

Something, a black sphere, flies down and lands in the middle of the soldiers.

-Woof!

It wasn't a bullet or a shell, it was a monster.

The creature curls into a ball and unfurls its scorpion-like body.

What should have been its face was merely a dark hole, with spindly tentacles running through it.

-kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!

"Boom!"

The fierce, eerie tones emanating from the abyssal hole stunned the soldiers around him, and even Ludwig, who was still relatively far away.

Nearby soldiers began to collapse, blood pouring from their eyes, ears, and mouths at the mere sound of that cursed cry.

-Kaaaaaaaaaah!

"Ugh!"

Ludwig gritted his teeth in anguish that threatened to tear his head off.

Every monster is different.

Some breathe fire and lightning, while others attack the mind.

You never know what they're going to attack with, and some of them are just plain unreasonable.

Hunkered down and covering their ears, the screams of terror that seeped through the gaps didn't wake the soldiers, and neither did Ludwig.

-Quack! Quack!

The cowerers are trampled and crushed by the swarming monsters.

Thousands were about to be wiped out by this irrational attack, and Ludwig was no exception.

The moment.

-Kaaaaaaaah!

Someone, red hair flying wildly, began to run toward the center of the screams of terror.

Even as those who heard the screams nearby bled to death without exception, the redhead charged into the center of it, seemingly unaffected in the slightest by the screams of terror.

-POOF!

I plunged my sword into its gaping maw and twisted.

-Quazik! Quadruple!

In short order, the monster was dismantled and fell.

The girl who killed the monster comes running to Ludwig, covered in blue energy.

"Are you okay?"

"Scarlett......."

"Get up, we don't have time for this."

"Okay."

Ludwig rises to his feet, feeling the reverberations of the screams echoing through his head.

A talent named Immunity.

It makes no exception for monsters.

For some reason, the monsters' uncanny powers don't affect Scarlett at all.

No flames, no concussions, no mind-bending terror.

As long as it wasn't a direct attack, Scarlet was free from the power of all those monsters.

That's why Scarlett hunted down and killed monsters who wielded unreasonable power.

Without Scarlett, even Ludwig would have fallen flat on his face and died.

It saved Ludwig's life as well as the lives of many soldiers.

But we have to fight harder to avoid the next crisis.

Before Ludwig could get himself upright, Scarlett was already running into the middle of the battlefield.

What is the monster?

Scarlett's immunity keeps her safe from the monsters' uncanny powers, but it doesn't protect her from the physical force of their grasping, tearing, and biting.

-deaddead

The ground weeps.

"Earthquake?

And now there are monsters that cause earthquakes every now and then.

No.

-deaddeaddead!

As Ludwig watches the growing tumult of the earth, and the earth beginning to tremble in response to its echoes, he realizes that it is not caused by any special force.

When you don't know what you're up against, your instincts are your best friend.

Intuitive, immediate situational awareness and action.

When Ludwig realizes that the huge rumbling in the ground is not an earthquake, but something is coming from underground.

And when she saw that giant echo coming at Scarlett's feet.

"Scarlett! Dodge!"

"......!"

-Pow!

Ludwig watched as a worm with enormous, hideous gills erupted from the ground, devouring Scarlett, dozens of monsters, and dozens of soldiers.
