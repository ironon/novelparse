-srrrr

A meadow with green grass rippling in the breeze.

-Kagang!

The shockwave from the clash of sword to sword scatters blades of grass, punctures the earth, and scatters shards of the magic shield.

-Thump! Quack!

The darkness of the Void traced sharp, thick trajectories across the gleaming blade, and I busily teased it, dodging and parrying.

A few times like that.

No, a couple times like this.

I can't even remember the number anymore.

I can't even count how many days I've been dead.

It's almost second nature now.

Battlefield in the Otherworld.

-Quack!

With the Alsbringer out of my grasp, a dark sword is pointed at my nape.

-skuck!

Voidblade Ramen sweeps across my throat, and an eerie pain flashes through my mind.

The Ritual Arsenal.

"After ......."

And awakening.

Once again, in the meadow, I look across at Ellen, who stands across from me, looking the same as she did the first time, but this time she has her tiara out.

In all this training to ward off the death that will one day come.

Somehow, I'm getting more comfortable with defeat and death than victory.

"Beat me once."

"......."

In her dreams, Ellen was always silent.

It's just a rush.

-shhhh!

Ellen, flying on the breeze, stabs her Voidblade at me.

A battle in a dream that should have been a thousand units long ago.

I still haven't done more than hold out on Ellen.

"Why don't you just take it easy, maybe one day in three?"

When I woke up, Airi, who had her hand on my forehead, asked me with concern.

My forehead and entire body were covered in a cold sweat.

No wonder.

It would be weird if I died dozens of times in my dreams and my body didn't react. If anything, I'd be afraid that I'd gotten too used to dying.

Now, in the moments when I'm actually fighting, I sometimes want to slap the shit out of them because I'm afraid I'll just think it's a dream and give up.

"Sleep is dead and I can sleep forever."

"...... Don't be an asshole."

Airi's expression darkens as she says something she's heard before.

Morning.

More than two months have passed since the events of the Cult of the Lord.

March.

After a long winter, spring is here.

Spring of Departure.

Spring is in the air.



* * *



"The Alliance is almost ready to depart, we'll be on our way any minute now, and our destination is, you guessed it, Gethsanosia."

Everyone in the room nodded as Herriot spoke.

The Allies have regrouped and will now march to their next destination.

For an army that has been on the march for a long time, this break could be long or short.

It would be an understatement to say that it went by in a flash.

But just as I didn't spend that time playing, no, rather busy, the Allies had a lot going on in that short time.

This time, Sarkegar speaks up.

"Your Majesty, I have news that the improvements to the Titan are complete."

"How much?"

"I think we're up and running about five times longer than we were before."

"So it's roughly 30 to 40 minutes?"

"Yeah, it looked like he had some extra armor too."

The Titan was only able to move for about seven minutes.

But Adelia, the Archduke, and the Archduke's mages set to work to improve the Titan.

In just over three months, we've seen encouraging results, increasing Titan's uptime fivefold.

Sarkegar's report of scouting the Allied side was over.

Then Next.

Olivia Ranze.

"It's going pretty well."

"......."

"Okay, so we've got the high priests all in, and now we've got the lower priests being indoctrinated, covertly of course."

"What's going on with the pagan inclusion policy?"

"It's a sensitive issue, and we've been treading carefully since the announcement of the pagan policy, but you know what they say: if you mess with it too much, it'll happen again. We're going to have to start with the priests within the Order to get their minds right. It's a work in progress. You didn't expect it to happen anytime soon, did you?"

"And Rowen?"

"You know he's got all kinds of mental issues, but his work ethic is impeccable, and honestly, he's probably the most loyal person here, you just have to watch out for him doing weird shit with his loyalty."

"It should be."

It was inevitable that it would devour the Order.

But convincing all the priests of the Church of the Lord to embrace demonism was not going to happen overnight.

Add to that the inclusion of all pagans, and it becomes even more of an afterthought.

Therefore, we could not make any rash moves until we had established a firm grip on the Order and its edification to our liking.

The high priests are all subsumed by us, but most of the lower priests don't know that.

Since we don't have to worry about interference from the outside, we only have to worry about things falling apart from the inside.

Reform the Crusader Knights and the Cult of the Lord from within.

I don't know if reform is the right word.

And we're not just talking about the Church of the Lord.

"From our Demon Lord?"

"The integration is well underway, and I'd say we're about a sixth of the way there already. Now that we've picked up the pace, it looks like we'll soon have a majority of Satanists with a consistent belief system."

Antirrhinus says with a grim smile.

It's kind of fitting.

Since Rowen was nominally the head of the Crusader Knights, it was now Antrianus' job to unite the Demonists and Championists in the refugee camps.

Much to my chagrin, there was no one else as dedicated to the grumpy job as I was, so I couldn't think of anyone better suited than Antony.

I hadn't intended to send Antirrhinus in the first place. Someone has to do it, and when I asked who, the old man raised his hand with a childlike expression.

Integrate the Demon Cultists, and then merge them with the Cult of the Gods when you feel the Cult of the Gods is sufficiently reformed.

In the blink of an eye, you've gone from a continent that's almost tasteless to a group that can be called a nation.

"I always told you not to do anything stupid."

"Whether it be, Great One."

What Rowen and Antony have in common.

It's reliable, but there's always that crucial element of unease.

Antrianus has a tendency to make things worse when he wants to make them worse, and Rowen, while loyal to me, has the potential to do strange things of his own accord.

There's a saying about borrowing a fern hand when you're short-handed.

That's wrong.

Bracken is not insecure.

In many ways, I felt like I was borrowing from the devil, not the fern, because there were no people and I had to use everything I could.

The Alliance is ready to go.

Check for Titan improvements.

Cruising through the Lord's Order tasks.

Masochist integration cruising.

And again.

Look at Elyse.

"Immortal's allied deployment has been finalized."

"......Yes."

Immortal.

The Empire secretly decided to call it that.

"We can't commit openly, but it looks like we're going to do what we've done in the past: scout the battlefield ahead of time and preemptively wipe out small gates."

"The Empire has decided that only the most elite of the Immortals will be used."

"The scale of the input is three thousand Master Classes, ten Grandmasters, and a thousand Archmages. Technically, they could probably take on a large city on their own."

"We've also noticed that certain amounts of breakage are instantly regenerated."

"In the case of irreversible destruction, it looks like it could be salvaged and recovered."

There are 3,000 masterclasses to help you become one of the most powerful people on the planet.

A thousand mages, each with a level that allows them to cast mass teleport.

And ten grandmasters, of which there have not been many in history.

Some Grandmasters have even reached the level of Archmage at the same time.

There have been many geniuses in history.

All those geniuses came back from the dead.

Mankind's mightiest army.

No, it would be the greatest army in history.

They can't get hurt because they're already dead, and they can regenerate if their injuries are minor.

Even if it is destroyed, it will automatically return to its underground laboratory at the Temple College of Magic and be automatically repaired.

It's a disaster of an army.

The gate debacle is over.

Finally, after a trial deployment, if they realize they can take down a massive warp gate on their own, the Alliance might just pull out on the spot.

That army is a problem, but we're focusing on a different problem.

"Replication?"

"It doesn't appear to be possible at this time, but it's inevitably something we're working on. Keep it in mind, but I think it would be unseemly for the Empire to go that far."

A golem whose alchemy is infused with black magic to animate it.

I'm afraid of what will happen if the military, which I fear even now, is able to clone itself.

I felt it in my bones why people are afraid of risky technology.

Only now I'm moving with the same purpose, but when the force is directed at me.

You can't help but think of that time.

"If a technology is developed to prevent a gategate, and the gategate becomes nothing....... If that's a good thing....... I still don't know."

I couldn't help but agree with Charlotte's concern.

At this point, the gate situation seems to be resolved.

But what happens when you've done too many risky things to get through a crisis?

I couldn't help but feel anxious.

"Maybe we shouldn't think about it so hard, after all, the Immortals are just machines, powerful but without free will, and if we need to subdue them, we need to subdue the controllers, not the machines."

Rusinil has a point.

You don't necessarily need to create magic to break a tank in order to defeat it.

A spell that snipes people inside the vehicle is enough.

After all, Immortals are golems in human form, and they are controlled by someone.

Its controls, or controllers.

If you can get your hands on it, the Immortal is a tin can in human form.

But is it possible.

I realize, of course, that the Empire isn't the only one to be vanquished.

"The important thing is, they know it."

"Sure, because you're not an idiot."

Whether it's the Empire or the guys running the Immortals themselves, they're bound to be aware of the weaknesses in their operations. There's no reason why they wouldn't consider any weaknesses we can think of.

If you don't prepare properly, you may end up with an immortal that runs amok.

Then it's all over.

"Anyway, the Immortals aren't going to be used to attack us anytime soon, but it's worth keeping an eye out for ways to neutralize or deal with them."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

The march begins again.

A changed Alliance will move toward the end of the Gate Crisis under changed circumstances.

Finally, we look at Charlotte.

Now that we've reported enough about what's going on externally, it's time to share what's going on internally.

"The migrant resettlement is almost complete, Rajakh will be much less overcrowded, the local administration has been set up, and we don't have to worry about security issues."

Disperse the overpopulation of Razak to the rest of the archipelago.

This is something that hasn't been done well because the stability of local administrations is questionable. Anything that weakened local control would be leaked, and that's not a good thing.

However, Charlotte did succeed in establishing a functioning local government.

Create a system of policing, administration, and reporting.

That's why it's only now becoming a proper country.

"Continue to work on establishing and stabilizing the local administration. If things get out of hand, we may need to bring some of the pagans and fiends from the Huangdao here."

One by one, the tasks are completed.

Prepare with all things considered.

But.

I wonder if I'll end up being unprepared.

Such ominous imaginings persisted.



* * *



The Senate meeting is over.

What we've been doing, getting out in front, scouting the battlefield, and killing through preemptive strikes, stops for now.

Immortals will do the work for us.

And it's clear that Immortal can do that much more accurately and reliably than we can, because it's a scale that makes your hair stand on end.

Unless you're playing a metropolis-scale game, there may not be a need for us to get involved anymore.

We may have to hold our breath, thinking about the post-Gate world.

"Reinhard, do you have a minute?"

It was Harriet who followed me out of the meeting.

"Overflow."

"......No, I don't mean to go off topic, but aren't you supposed to have all the time in the world?"

Uh.

That's right.

I'm not supposed to have a lot of time on my hands, am I?

"I have all the time in the world to spend on you."

If you don't have one, you'll have to make one.

Cancer.

Who's calling.

Needless to say, his face turned bright red at my words.

"You, you crazy bastard......!"

"Ew, why the hell would I even have time!"

"I'm not going to say that shameless thing anymore. You, you, you, you, you, you! What if someone hears you!"

"What are we, other people, huh?"

It's a leftover.

But honestly.

Isn't that a lot of leftover?

That, if you turn your back, it's a man, not a woman.......

That works.......

"Da, shut up!"

He was beaten for a long time by a gaping maw.

Of course, as always, it didn't hurt a bit.
