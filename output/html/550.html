Delfin Izadra.

I wouldn't say we were close, but we were classmates and after the desert island mission, he kept flirting with me.

The guy who should have survived to the end, and one of the two main heroines, is dead.

So vainly.

Unable to fight anymore, Ludwig is likely to stay away from fighting.

If this means that Ludwig, who was supposed to die in the original, survives a non-battle ending, I wonder if that's a good thing.

Now that I've taken on Ludwig's role, I think he deserves to live.

We don't know what Ludwig's vacancy will look like, and we don't know if he'll lose his role in the war.

Or maybe they're still trying to fight.

But in that case, Ludwig will most likely die.

It would be foolish to lose your right arm and try to fight with your left.

I hope he doesn't dream of such a thing, but there's no telling how reality will roll now.

I heard a shocking revelation from the Royal Class side, and after all, I couldn't be the only one.

Harriet, Liana, and Charlotte.

When they heard the news of the royal class, they couldn't help but make faces.

Charlotte cried for a long time when she heard of Delphine's death and Ludwig's injury. To her, they were classmates in the same B class, and she would never be able to hear the story as if it were someone else's.

Harriet couldn't hold back her tears, and Riana was speechless.

But there's no point in mourning.

We eventually had to take the next step, and there was too much work to be done to stop.

Tears should be swallowed inwardly.

I tried not to consciously think about the Royal Class thing, and didn't mention it.

Not mentioning it doesn't make it go away, but no one talked about it, even though we had agreed not to mention it to each other.



* * *



The Allies will winter in Serandia.

If it's a climate problem, we can fix it, but Riana's powers are mind-eating.

We can't always help the Allies, so it was okay for them to winter in Serandia.

It's not just the weather; you've just faced a major battle, and you'll need time to repair and refurbish your army.

We won't be able to forget someone's death this winter, but I hope we can get through it.

"The Allies will be inactive for a while, so we won't be either."

The time of year is winter.

If the Allies don't move, there's not much reason for us to move.

We're at war, or should I say, we're in a war, but eventually there will be a few months off.

The Allies would have time to reorganize, improving their Titans in preparation for the next advance, and trying to deal with the shock, horror, and grief of so many deaths.

"Great One, is it not necessary to have a countermeasure against the Titans?"

"......Countermeasures?"

"Yes."

Antirrhinus said.

"You are the only one who has seen the Titan in person, but I have heard that he is the size of a mountain and can crush hundreds of monsters with a single step. Is there any reason to believe that step will not be directed at us?"

"They don't know where we are in the first place. Even if they did, do you really think a Titan would cross the ocean to get here?"

I don't know if the Titan is big enough to walk across the ocean, but I don't think it will.

"There's always a what if, right?"

"Hmmm......."

For now, we're helping the Allies, but we don't know when war will break out.

Let's say a Titan and I are fighting.

Me fighting a golem as big as a mountain.

I'm getting shy just thinking about it.

Come to think of it, I think there was a game like that.

"We don't think it's a bad idea to have a weapon similar to the Titan either......."

I sighed at Antony's words.

I see where this guy is coming from.

"You don't just want to have a Titan or something, do you?"

"......Hmm, isn't that interesting, a giant golem that never existed in the world."

and.

The look on that old man's face, like, "I've been caught," makes me think there's something in there.

Is this a joke?

I mean, this old guy is not a kid, and he's saying this with the mindset of approaching some kind of toy?

Has dementia finally set in?

I had a sneaking suspicion, but is it true?

"Hey, Harriet, do you think we could build something like a Titan?"

"If you have the plans and the materials, there's nothing you can't build. But you don't have the plans, and even if you did, you don't have the materials."

"That's a part of Titan that already exists......."

"Shut up, old man, I'm not building a Titan, and I'm not going to steal it."

"That's too bad......."

Antirhynchus was getting a lot of frustrated looks from the wrong places.

"If you pull some bullshit about how you've suddenly stolen control of Titan, I'm going to make you feel what it's like to be decapitated by a holy sword for real this time, so don't you dare."

Antrianus chuckled at my harshness and nodded in understanding.

I don't know what that old man is going to do, and I'm not at all comfortable with it.

"But, Your Majesty. Antrianus' words about the need for a countermeasure against the Titans seem reasonable."

Antirrhinus's futile rantings eventually reached Sarkhegar, who returned to Edina.

"Why the hell would you fight something like that? It's just a bunch of unintelligent monsters, and we see it and we charge at it. We have intelligence and we can think. If there's a Titan in front of you, you run. Why would you even think about fighting it?"

"But what if the Titans come across the ocean and end up here? We can't abandon this place."

"What's wrong with your sister!"

"No, am I wrong, you're right."

Eventually, even Olivia sighed heavily with worry.

I mean, we know we're going to clash with the empire later on, but why is everyone taking it like it's a foregone conclusion?

But.......

Right?

Let's say the war breaks out, and you've solved the uptime problem.

Let's say a Titan crosses the continent and raids Edina.

Then what?

Titans are supposed to have as much defense as they do offense in the first place, right?

I can't make mountains out of molehills, and neither can anyone else here.

Should I smash it with a meteor?

My thoughts were shifting toward the need to have a Titan plan.

"If we assume that ...... can't travel through space, then the Titan can't even get here."

It wasn't me who came up with the answer, it was Charlotte.

"......? Why can't you come?"

"I haven't seen it, but I hear the Titan is big."

"Uh, a lot."

"I don't think a chunk that big can cross the ocean properly, and you'll be lucky if it doesn't get swept away by the currents. Don't take the ocean too seriously."

"......, right?"

"And we have mermaids."

"What's a mermaid got to do with a Titan?"

"Mermaids can manipulate ocean currents."

"......? Really?"

"......Didn't you know?"

This is the first I've heard of this today.

Charlotte seemed surprised that I didn't know.

"I heard the mermaids had a lot to do with the smooth sailing from Edina to Port Mokna so far. I don't know what they did with the weather, but they manipulated the currents to help us sail."

Since I don't encounter mermaids in person very often, I assumed that they would bring me fish, but apparently not.

Charlotte's so concerned with ruling Edina that she seems to have learned something I didn't. The demons recognize her as a demon, so she's probably treated as an equal to me.

Mermaids....... They weren't just pretty girls.

It was like a succubus or something.

Excellent.

I picked the right person.

Of course, I wonder if it's just me not knowing what I need to know.

"Anyway, if the Titan tries to cross the ocean and attack us, the mermaids will capture it and it won't be able to get here by spatial travel in the first place."

Antirrhynchus was obviously thinking about capturing the Titans, and Sarkegar and Olivia were relieved to hear that they weren't going to be attacked.

"Anyway, we'll just have to reorganize until the Allies leave, which isn't going to happen yet, but we also have to think about what we'll do if they run out of food......."

The Allied forces will have to operate large groups for very long periods of time, so there is a possibility of food shortages.

I'm not sure how much we can do about it if that happens.

While the Alliance takes time to reorganize, we need to find something to do.

"Reinhard, we need to augment our forces."

"Power up?"

Olivia said.

"Replenishment, not augmentation. We used up a lot of Deathknight in the Serandia campaign, too."

Death Knight.

Olivia, who has access to Kier's Holy Power, can summon Deathknights, and they were a big part of our last Serandia preemptive attack.

"I thought you could summon that thing at any time?"

"......what."

and.

I haven't seen that look on your face in a long time.

A genuinely pitiful look.

"You can replenish your Death Knights, of course. Or summon Deathknights at will. But it's all about the base, isn't it?"

"Bass?"

"So, is it stronger to make Deathknight from Reinhardt, or is it stronger to make Deathknight from that kid over there?"

"......Can we not talk bullshit?"

"Let's start with the results: that wimpy kid can't even be a Death Knight. You're going to get a skeleton, white and skimpy, but cute."

The sound was eerie to hear, and Herriot's eyes widened.

Death Knight with me as an ingredient.

Death Knight based on Heriot.

I don't like to think about it, but the result is probably obvious.

"Before the Cult came under our control, some people chose to become Death Knights themselves, and that's what we've seen before."

"......, yes, you did."

In fact, a number of Deathknights had joined them as they brought in the cultists.

Integrating them into the Cult was not without its headaches.

Pagans did a lot of crazy things that were unacceptable to society.

I did all sorts of things to get rid of that noise.

The Death Knights were then purged in large numbers.

Not only is it ominous from the outside, but many of them have been around too long to change their mindset.

"So the Death Knights I summon are either completely devoid of self or dead."

They are literally undead and have no sentience beyond listening to commands.

The conscious Death Knights were purged, and the unconscious, almost machine-like beings were the Death Knights Olivia summoned.

The power of corruption, and the Deathknights who answer its call.

"Anyway, Death Knight doesn't come out of the ground. No, it comes out of the ground, but if you've spent ten gigs today, it's done. It's gone."

"So you're saying you need to replenish?"

"Of course, and of course I like making powerful Death Knights."

Olivia crosses her arms and shakes her head.

"Of course, I can't say that Kieran's powers are exactly impossible to use to create a Death Knight, but it's better to have a good base."

My sister.

I'm starting to sound like an evil warlock.

"So you need good ingredients?"

I don't know if it's the right word, but if it's not an ingredient, what is it?

It's just a little creepy that it's a corpse.

"You mean you're going to use the people who died in this Serandia raid to make....... You're trying to make Death Knight out of......."

Harriet looks at Olivia in disbelief.

And the expressions on the others' faces weren't much different from Herriot's.

Even Antirrhinus stares at Olivia with his mouth hanging open, so that's saying something.

It's a matter of being surprised and feeling like, "What a stroke of genius!

Many have died. And the great and the good are dead.

If you make Deathknights out of their corpses, it's a no-brainer that they'll make excellent Deathknights.

But isn't that a little cruel, regardless of whether it's possible or not?

"Hmm, I was thinking about that, but it's probably going to be difficult."

Well, at least they did it if they could.......

"First of all, it's crazy to have a ritual to make Death Knight in the middle of a burning Allied camp, and we probably can't bury that many bodies, so we'll inevitably cremate them, what do you say, Mr. Sarkegar?"

Sarkegar didn't react to being called uncle. Like, whatever.

By the way, Sarkeghar, you look like a lady, not an old man.

Why is my sister always twisted like this?

"We actually do. Most people are buried by cremation. Occasionally, bodies are repatriated to the ecliptic for burial, but it's rare."

Olivia nodded at Sarkegar's affirmation.

"How do you raise a burnt-out bone dust that's gone? You'd have to force it to do something, and I'm not sure what, and it'd be weak, and I don't trust myself to do it in a place where the Crusaders have a permanent presence, let alone the Alliance, without getting my head blown off."

"That's right......."

A place where people mourn the dead, and the dead rise as Death Knights?

And is there anyone who does that?

It's like an ad asking you to kill me.

The environment of the Allied garrison, where you have no choice but to use makeup, and the fact that there are so many people that making Death Knight might lead to a goal.

You can't do that in Serandia because of that.

"So you have a place in mind?"

Aside from whether or not you can do it, where the hell are you going to get the ingredients?

Olivia giggles at my question.

"Imperial Mausoleum."

What?

What did I just hear?

"There are a lot of war heroes and greats lying there, like Nanda Ginda. Let's get some of them up and use them."

"What?! What the hell are you talking about!"

Charlotte paled and jumped to her feet.

"No, who's going to raise up a useless, weak imperial prince or a good emperor, let alone a helpful one?"

"Well, still! Still, that's not....... That's what......!"

Charlotte's face was turning a deep shade of blue as she couldn't take it anymore.

"Heh......."

This is that.......

To wit.

Hyeonchungwon Park robbery....... That's what you're talking about, right?

It's not a bomb, but it's worse than that....... Such.......

To Charlotte's consternation, Olivia shrugged.

"No, it's the end of the world, so what's the big deal about being a great man or a hero? They'll be happy to hear it. Where's the glory in dying and saving humanity? They'll thank me for it."

"Crazy...... year......."

Herriot shook his head in disgust.
