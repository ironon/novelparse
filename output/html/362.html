I had one last thing left to do, and I mean one last thing.

No, it's not the end, it's the beginning, in a sense, of getting everything in place.

Temple dormitory.

Night time.

"As of yesterday, we have concluded our contact with Owen de Getmora."

Inside my room in the dorm, I was listening to Sarkegar's report.

"What do you think, are you surprised?"

"He seemed a little surprised, but he's a trader by nature, so it was like he was bouncing off the abacus."

I would have panicked if a demonic force suddenly asked to join forces with me while I was working on a republican revolution for humanity. But then he calmed down and started to calculate the situation.

"They said they'd have to discuss it with their leadership, but as you said, I think the environment is right for a positive answer."

Now that we've identified you, you're as good as captured on a leash. If you refuse to join us, all you have to do is give the Empire information about the revolutionary forces.

"Yeah, because for the Empire, the fire that fell on our feet would be the revolutionaries, not us."

The existence of demonic forces is in itself a basis for uniting humanity. But the quasi-movement of revolutionary forces is a division within.

Demonic forces can't topple empires, but revolutionary forces can.

So in reality, it's the revolutionaries, not us, that the empire is really going to light up and exterminate.

Sarkegar looks at me cautiously.

"Of course, Owen had one condition for the meeting."

"It's a condition....... What is that?"

"He wants to see that the demon's descendants are real."

"Hmmm."

It's not unexpected, they're curious about how much of our power is left and what we can do if they join forces with us.

And you'll want to make sure that the rumored final demon really exists. If I'm as powerful as Ancient Vali, I'll be pretty damn reliable.

But I don't have that kind of actual power.

"What do you think I am, an archdemon?"

"That's right."

So it shouldn't be much different when I show up.

"What do you think you should do? Obviously, we'll need to agree on where and how to meet, and I don't think you should confront him directly. It could be a trap, or it could be dangerous."

We know them, they don't know us.

Showing up and exposing your power in that situation is not a good choice.

But they'd rather have an ally than be taken advantage of.

The Black Order has already caught up with you.

"It would be risky for me to go there myself. Tell them no face-to-face until we've established a level of trust. It's not like we can work together face-to-face."

Overkill is a time for restraint.

"Okay, degradation."

Sarkegaard looks at me as if he's finished with his report.

"We decided to work with Order."

"I see."

I didn't mention that Effinghauser was a member of the Black Order, because if I did, Sarkegar would try to get me out of the Temple at all costs.

"We're still not sure what the Black Order's goals are, but they seem to agree on one thing: to bring Cantus Magna down and fight alongside us. As long as our interests align, we'll work together, if not trust each other."

"......I think it's too risky."

Sarkegar is right.

And I'm actually in more danger. Sarkeghar will be furious if he finds out I hid Eppinhauser's membership in the Black Order.

"I don't know if it's right to tie our necks around this thing called Akasha, maybe that's not what we want?"

"I suppose."

What is Akasha.

I don't know.

But you've decided to do something, so you have to do it.

The die was cast a long time ago, and we're just moving the pieces now.

If I wasn't going to move my horse, I would have been stuck in Eleris' shop in the first place, killing time in the corner of that tiny two-story house, letting all the events and mishaps, including the gate debacle, play out in silence.

"And you know I stopped by the Demon Castle this time."

"Yes degradation. Was there something there?"

"There was a shelter, and there were supplies stored that could keep them alive for a very long time."

At my words, Sarkegar stares at me blankly.

"In the basement of Demon Castle....... You mean there's such a place?"

"Yeah, I guess you don't know either."

"Yes, that's right."

"It's like a labyrinth where the path doesn't open unless you're an Archdemon."

"A mysterious labyrinth, indeed....... I suppose it's not surprising, since the Ancestral Demon King was a master of magic......."

In reality, Airi was only vaguely aware that there was such a thing as a secret room in Demon Castle.

The Four Hundred Kings must have known about the bunker. But it was a closely guarded secret. Even Airi knew about the place, but not that it was a bunker.

If you know anything about bunkers, it's the Four Horsemen, the Devil, and me.

The rest is that I didn't know about the secret chamber in the Demon Castle. Of course, it's possible that someone else does, but we don't know.

"It's a labyrinth, and I don't think you can even enter unless you're an Archdemon."

"I see......."

"Anyway, there were a bunch of grimoires in there, and I'm going to use them as bait to draw out the Cantus Magna."

Enough with the bait.

So join the Black Order and prepare to reel in the big fish that is Cantus Magna.

"Pass this along to Lucinil, so she'll know about it."

Share your findings and decide what to do next.

"Yes, degradation."

Sarkegar turns into a sparrow and flies away.

I held still, pressed my temples together, and took a few deep breaths.

Shouldn't you be meeting the revolutionaries in person?

Am I really supposed to be in the Temple when the Black Order can lay hands on me at any moment?

Surely, the elixir is the answer to Charlotte's condition?

What if you messed with the wrong cantus magna and ended up with a bigger problem?

When everything goes wrong.

Actually, I was trying to save everyone.

Who the hell is going to believe me?



* * *



Four days have passed.

Nothing much has happened in the meantime. Contacts with the revolutionary forces were being approached cautiously, and no word had been received from Dr. Epinhauser.

However.

I'm pretty sure there were quite a few guys who got stepped on by me walking around as a dead man walking.

"Hey, me."

I locked myself in my room and pulled my hair out, and Riana called out to me.

It shows up when you least expect it and in a way you least expect it.

"What is it?"

"Let's go play with my sister."

I mean, he's had enough of beating up on Cliff, and now he's doing it to me?

"......Who are you?"

"Asshole, that's what I'm saying."

He grabs me by the scruff of the neck and drags me out of the room.

"Eek!"

"Come out anyway, asshole."

He thinks there are no worries and all he has to do is have fun.

She's a rich girl, but she's also like a rich girl and not like a rich girl at all.

Liana De Granz.

"A drink?"

"You and I aren't old enough to ask each other out for drinks like it's a given, are we?"

"I thought you were screaming your head off about that last time."

Somehow.

It's comforting to see someone like Riana, who doesn't seem to have a problem with this kind of behavior.

The time is still afternoon.

Riana says, dragging me along.

"Anyway, give me a minute."

"What are you going to do?"

"We need to talk."

Riana smirks at me.

"I don't know why you're a killer, but I know a lot of kids who get tired when you're a killer."

-Pak-Pak!

Riana pats me on the shoulder.

"You're not going to die with a frown on your face."

It doesn't mean you can't wear it.

I mean, you can walk around with a frown on your face.

"Right."

I smirked, and she clicked her tongue at me.

"I bet the pig that's being led to the slaughter tomorrow doesn't look like you."

"A little harsh?"

"Yeah, come out like this. It's more familiar."

When I looked like I was about to lose my temper, Riana giggled and patted me on the back.

Liana De Granz.......

Always so far away and yet so close.

It's a weird one.



* * *



You said you had time.

Riana led me outside the temple.

"Where are you going?"

"Follow me."

He even dragged me on a horsepower train.

Come to think of it, there weren't that many times I was alone with him.

The first time I spoke to Riana was on a group mission to a deserted island, and after that, I didn't really feel like we were close, but after the summer vacation, I felt like we had a casual relationship.

There are not many events or things that have accumulated, so to speak, but it was a strange relationship that somehow became close and we didn't feel uncomfortable with each other at all.

A relationship where you can call each other friends without hesitation.

I think it is.

On a horse-drawn train, not very crowded, but not unoccupied either, you grip the handle and stare blankly out the window.

Scenes similar to Seoul, but never the same as Seoul, pass by.

Although the process of getting on the train was the same, the scenery of Hwangdo didn't look anything like the Seoul in my head.

On a rocking train.

"What's wrong?"

Liana de Granz asks, holding still.

I could feel his concern for me in his simple words.

There's a lot going on. I just can't tell you what it is.

"Everything's fine."

"Yeah. Because that's what people do for no reason."

He didn't look too convinced, but he didn't pry. Riana was silent for a moment, trying to find another topic, but then she spoke.

"Now the juniors are coming in."

"......Yes."

I was so focused on the problem at hand that I wasn't thinking about it at all.

We're in our second year, and soon the freshmen will be joining the royal class.

There are quite a few guys in the junior class who played roles in the original, and I don't think my behavior would have affected that, so they'll get into the Royal Class as normal. Though they'll mostly be associated with Ludwig.

Of course, even there, there's a feeling of being divided into freshman A and B classes, replicating the knowledge among seniors.

Junior.

Thinking about it, it's actually a bit of a departure from temples.

"If only there weren't more juniors like you."

"......What's wrong with me?"

"Do you think it's good to have a junior who's going to give the senior who came to teach you discipline a double whammy?"

"Ah."

Thinking about it, it's kind of mind-numbing.

A junior like me comes in?

Worst.

Riana looks at me and asks.

"What would you do if Harriet got a group of juniors together to talk about this and that, and they were all crying about where the hell is the discipline?"

Uh.

That's it.

Uh.......

"......."

"You're not going to let him get away with it, are you? You're not going to jump up and down like that senior who paraded you around the other day?"

I can't say no!

I insulted Redina, who was there to discipline the juniors, and she smirked and said we'll see, and then brought in Ard, a sophomore, and I got beat up by Ard and narrowly escaped with a gut-breaker.

But now that I'm a sophomore.

We're not going to boss you around.

Say, for example, that the junior asshole talked smack to the senior asshole.

If she sees that and she's freaking out and crying and telling me that this happened.

'A junior sent me.......'

If you say something like that.

I'm not sure I can make it out of that dough.

Ard de Gritis.......

You.......

It was worth it.......

It wasn't until a year later that I understood what the man who parachuted me in was thinking.

I'm confident I could do worse, not better.......

Who do you think you are, my dear? She looks like this, but she's a princess.

It's disgusting and annoying when it happens, and I'm not sure I wouldn't do it myself if the situation called for it!

As if reading my expression and knowing what I was thinking, Riana giggled.

"It's funny, though, when you think about it. I thought you were such a crazy person when you were doing all that crazy stuff at the beginning of last year....... and here you are."

I literally had no reason to be friends with him, but after everything that happened, I did. I don't think Riana ever thought she'd be able to take a walk outside with a scowl like mine.

Riana looks out the window and smiles thinly.

"This was fun."

"......."

"I hope it's the same this year."

As Riana says, "We had a lot of fun last year, so we want to have a lot of fun this year.

"......Yes."

I hope so, too.



* * *



It didn't take me long to figure out where the heck Riana was going to take me after the magic train ride.

A cluster of mansions in the northern ecliptic.

Even there, in front of the gates of a very large mansion, Riana stopped.

"Of course, this is your house, isn't it?"

"I know."

There.

What the hell does my seemingly depressed mood have to do with you inviting me over?

Riana smirked.

"Now, slowly, I have to ask permission."

"Permission? Permission for what?"

"Marriage."

"Uh, no, no. What?"

"What, you don't like it?"

What the fuck is this guy talking about?

Is that how you've been looking at me all this time?

"Uh, well, ah....... No, because I don't understand what you're talking about, and I'm sorry......."

"...... Just kidding, you can't be serious."



Riana clicked her tongue in disbelief and kicked him, and then a blue lightning bolt shot out of his hair.

-Physics!

"Also, is it a little annoying that you're being so polite?"

"No, no, no, don't pull this shit!"

"Shut up."

Riana crossed her arms as if her pride had been bruised by the unnecessary prank, and before long, the manor's doors were opened by its occupants.

"Welcome, ma'am."

"Yes."

"They're all waiting for you in the outbuilding."

Wait.

Who?

"Follow me."

Riana took my arm and led the way through the sprawling mansion.

"You should count yourself blessed, asshole."

Riana yelled something unintelligible as she dragged me away.
