            Episode 582.





Louise von Schwarz received an unexpected vacation during the winter.

She was ordered to rest by the one person above her, her king and father.

During the winter, the King of Cernstadt was to take command of the army.

But she had to at least complete the handover, so it was some time before she could communicate the status of the Cernstadt forces and what was important.

That's why, after all the handoffs have been made, power has been delegated to the king.

By late night, she was able to reach the ecliptic via the Alliance's warp spot.

It wasn't until the late hours of the night, after several days of handoffs, that we reached the ecliptic.

So now.

Louise seemed to know what it was like to have her eyes spinning.

It's my first time traveling the length of the ecliptic, it's late at night, and it's snowing.

It's not that I've never stopped by the palace, but I've never been allowed to go to the temple.

She didn't recognize the distances of the ecliptic, so she couldn't tell where she was in the snowy night.

And right now, Louise is as embarrassed as she is excited about the situation.

I didn't know how to deal with my father's anger, and he was losing it.

Because of Heinrich's presence, Louise has accepted the idea of being a proxy for her brothers like it's a foregone conclusion.

Moreover, suddenly, the unthinkable happened.

Go to the temple.

So Louise finds this situation strangely uplifting, embarrassing, exciting, and sad.

He was told to go to the temple to rest, and he came alone.

For the first time in a long time, Louise felt like a child.

Also, technically, she's not the brightest bulb in the box.

I don't have the best eyesight, but it's a great place to get lost.

I even tried to find a temple and ended up in an imperial palace with nothing to do.

At this rate, I'd either be greeting the sun in the streets tomorrow morning or being buried alive in a snowstorm, so I asked a palace guard for the location of the temple.

"This is north of Daeha, and the temple is south of Daeha.

"Oh......?

It wasn't so much that I took a wrong turn, but that I could have gone the other way on purpose.

Eventually she staggers off and makes her way to Irene Daeha.

First, you'll need to cross the river to find the temple.

The famous Horsepower Train, the pride of the Huangdao, was out of commission and unavailable.

'No....... If it was up and running, I'd be more lost.......'

Louise has heard of magic trains, but she's never ridden one. She's only seen it a few times from a distance, making bizarre noises as it moves toward the ecliptic.

In any case, Louise is getting her first taste of navigating on her own.

Feeling like a lost child, Louise walks vaguely south of the ecliptic.

With the right orientation, you can find your way through a blizzard.

The problem was this.

A dozen bridges that connect the north and south of the ecliptic.

You must take one of those bridges to the south of the ecliptic.

"......."

But the snow made it impossible to see, so she ended up on the boardwalk along the Irine Daeha River.

And there, frozen in the winter cold, was the great Irine River. A light layer of snow lay on the frozen river.

Of course, frozen rivers can be crossed on foot.

Do we really need to find a bridge?

I could just walk across the river. Why?

'I just need to get across.......'

Louise doesn't walk along the riverbank looking for a bridge. She goes down to the frozen river and steps onto the ice.

Suddenly, Louise was on her way to Doha in the middle of the night.

-pawpawpaw

The sound of the Princess of Schwarz's footsteps in the snow rang out.

Louise stumbled a few times as she crossed the frozen Irine River.

-Bam!

"......."

Even if you have the balance of a superhero in a master class, you can still fall down a snowy slope if you're not careful.

Louise woke up in the snow, patted her ass, and looked around uselessly. She wondered if anyone had seen her.

It's the middle of a snowy, icy day, and there are no passersby. So there's no way anyone could have seen it.

But Louise walked away, her face slightly flushed, her steps quickening as if she were trying to get away.

Sure enough, I fell a few more times.



* * *



After crossing the frozen river, Louise reached the streets south of Daeha.

Temples and imperial palaces are buildings that can be found anywhere on the ecliptic, as long as the ground is slightly elevated. They are not called landmarks of the ecliptic gradient for nothing.

But now, with the snow falling, neither the temple nor the palace is visible.

Louise walked for a long time.

I asked where the temple was, on a deserted street after a heavy snowfall, and found my way.

"You can go over there, over there."

"From here....... Is it far......?"

It's hard to say it out loud, and it's hard to say it in an imperative tone, so Louise can only say it in a vague interrogative form that's neither half-assed nor dismissive.

"Umm....... You'll be there for a while."

The person who asked for directions said he was busy too and disappeared.

Louise felt ridiculous, like a lost child. The idea of being a princess and heir to the First Empire seemed like a fantasy.

Of course, aside from that, you also have the ability to be a Swordmaster, which is a master class, but that doesn't help you find your way around at all.

Still, I couldn't help but be excited.

A temple that was forbidden to even look at from a distance.

Louise's heart skipped a beat at the prospect of seeing the place her son had grown up in.

Of course, the Zodiacal Gradient was not a glorious city, and the mood was palpable.

It was a snowy night, but the whole city had an air of despair and death about it.

If you had come to the ecliptic in good times, you might have felt jealous, but now the ecliptic gradient was a city of death.

The rare passersby hunkered down and walked up and down the streets, and the accumulating snow slowly covered the city, threatening to kill.

The situation in the capital city of Cernstadt would be no different.

In a world where the environment could be worse than Huangdao anywhere, it may be that Huangdao is an incredible city just for the fact that it has maintained its appearance.

And.

Suddenly, Louise could hear a group of footsteps coming from beyond.

Too scared to move to the side of the road, a group of people rushed past.

"......What is it?

Louise couldn't help but instinctively recognize them in their steps and actions.

Those who have been trained in combat have different footsteps to begin with.

They disappeared into the distance without a glance at Louise.

I don't know what was so urgent, but Louise couldn't wait to ask for directions.

What could possibly happen in the middle of the night that would cause someone so professionally trained in combat to move with such a serious expression?

Louise snapped out of her thoughts.

For now, we need to find the temple.

I was going to turn into a real snowman if I stayed still.



* * *



As Louise walked in the direction of the temple, the night grew deeper and the snow piled higher.

This inevitably led to problems.

'What the hell is this....... Where am I?

It was inevitable that Louise would become a missing person.

I knew the temple was close, but there was no one to ask for directions anymore.

"I know it's close, but.......

Louise walked down the street anyway. In the direction she'd been told the temple was.

I wonder how long that walk was.

Louise finally spotted something beyond the pouring snow.

"Lights?

Something like a blue flame flared up.

"What is it?

Whatever it is, you're going to get lost and end up in the same place.

Soon, Louise couldn't help but notice the blue light getting closer.

A person.

A disenchanted one, too.

Someone was approaching, a flame of flesh-enhancing blue mana.

And I wasn't alone, there was someone beside me, dragging something.

The approaching man was pulling something resembling a cart.

-Is this correct?

-Aigo, thank you. There you go. Put it in here.

Someone pulled a wheelbarrow into what appeared to be a warehouse in the dark.

-I could have been in trouble without you.

-No, I was on my way, and watch your back.

Louise watched the scene from some distance.

A young man pulling a cart, and an old man.

I could see that it was a young man helping an old man.

But Louise couldn't help but notice something else about the young man, aside from the fact that he was capable of magical enhancement.

-A young man with a small body has been through a lot. Here's the least I can do for him.......

The sleeve of the young man's right arm was loose.

-No, it's okay. It's really okay.

Louise stayed nearby until the exchange between the old man, who was trying to reciprocate, and the young man, who was coldly refusing, was over.

After the old man entered the house, the young man turned around and couldn't help but make eye contact with Louise, who was staring at him.

"Do you need to see me......? Before that.......? Are you okay......?"

"That....... that......."

Louise von Schwarz.

The princess of the House of Schwarz says, with an uncharacteristically pitiful expression on her face.

"Can you give me directions to the temple....... to the temple......?"

I don't know him, but he doesn't hesitate to help out when he's not feeling well himself.

And right now, Louise needed that help.

The young man smiled when he heard that.

"Oh, I have to go there too, let's go together."

"That's right......!"

Louise jumped up and down in her seat.



* * *



With Ludwig's guidance, Louise was able to reach the temple in no time.

When I got there, I wondered why I had gotten lost.

Of course, the falling snow turned both Ludwig and Louise into snowmen.

Louise could only thank God that the young man who had shown up at the right time, and the one who had the ability to enhance her powers, was a Temple student.

But that wasn't the end of it.

A temple is a region, not a building.

As soon as she crossed the gate, Louise was stunned by the snowy view of the temple and its vast grounds.

I did get some guidance from a Temple student.

But he'll go where he needs to go, and then he'll be lost again. Luiz is half-convinced that he'll be guided, but he'll get lost along the way.

Mia outside the temple just becomes Mia inside the temple.

Capture one of the Temple guards.

Louise's head is spinning.

Ludwig laughed, as if he knew what Louise was thinking when he saw her go white.

"The inside of the temple is quite large as well, where are you going, let me guide you to your destination."

"Hey, are you sure....... Are you sure you want to......?"

His demeanor is polite, but there is an indelible joy and eagerness in his expression.

"Yes."

It's amazing to see someone who doesn't even care about her own body so much as helping others.

"I need to go to a place called Royal Class Dormitory....... Do you know where it is?"

"......?"

The young man shook his head at that.

"Don't you know? If so, I can't help it......."

"No, it's just that that's where I'm headed....... I was just a little surprised."

"......?"

"Come on, let me walk you through it."

The person you asked for directions is the same as your destination.

The young man in front of you is not a teacher or a guard, so he must be a student.

Suddenly, Louise couldn't help but notice the empty sleeve of the young man's right arm, which she had consciously avoided asking or looking at.

Louise knew about what happened to her son's friends.

Dead classmates.

And stories about classmates who were injured.

"Do you happen to know if your name is....... Ludwig....... is that right?"

"......How do I change my name?"

My son's friend!

"I'm Heinrich's mom......!"

Louise bit her tongue, so excited that she almost slipped up.

"!!!"

"Hey, are you okay......?"

She bit down so hard, Louise couldn't help but taste the bitter taste of beef in her mouth.



* * *



Ludwig took the lead, and Louise followed.

"I never thought you were a princess....... Excuse me. Oh, no, Commander......."

Ludwig was ecstatic to learn that Louise was Heinrich's sister and the military commander of Cernstadt. Ludwig had never been involved with the Cernstadt army, so he had only heard stories about Louise, but this was the first time he had seen her face.

Louise shook her head at Ludwig's words.

"No, no, it's okay. No offense, not at all. Not at all. I'm grateful. I'm a friend of Heinrich's......."

When Louise realized that the person who showed up at the right time wasn't just a Temple student, but a friend of her son's, her excitement was short-lived.

Louise stares at the back of Ludwig's head.

The sleeve of his right arm flapped pathetically.

Ruiz couldn't watch Heinrich grow up.

But through reports, we've heard about Heinrich's schooling at Temple and how he's doing.

Heinrich's classmates in the Royal Class.

So Louise had to get to know Ludwig, and after the war, she got to know him even better.

Ludwig.

B-11, second year Royal Class. Technically a horse, his talent is physical strength.

It's a short-lived talent, but she has an extraordinary five senses that she realizes even before she learns to enchant.

Of course, there were three more such cases from the second year of the Royal Class, but two of them were a demon and a warrior. I wouldn't dare compare them.

So if I had been educated in the royal class without the war, I could have been in the master class before graduation.

But the war took Ludwig's arm.

Even in his condition, with training and practice, he might be able to fight, but Louise saw the resignation in Ludwig's eyes.

I don't know why, but I recognized Ludwig's despair in the way he sat there on a snowy night, looking like he had lost everything.

War is always taking something from someone.

"By the way, did you see that cart earlier......?"

Louise saw Ludwig for the first time today.

Losing his arm, he retreated from the battlefield and returned to the temple.

But on this snowy day, I saw an old man I didn't know pulling a wagon on the street.

"Oh, I thought you might have slipped on the snow and hurt your back, so I drove to your house......."

"I see......."

Louise smiled at Ludwig, who scratched his head with a clumsy smile.

It's hard not to feel good when you see someone with a good heart. Especially when you're the beneficiary of that goodness.

Because.

Louise felt even more sorry for Ludwig's empty right arm sleeve.

Ludwig can't help but notice an old man who has fallen in the snow and is moaning.

The person who uses their time and energy to pull the old man's cart home for him.

Ruiz doesn't know the details of how Ludwig lost his arm, but he does have some idea.

I've heard reports of people losing their arms trying to save friends in danger.

Eventually, my inability to turn away from someone met a cruel day and I took his arm.

It was during this time that Ludwig's empty sleeve reminded me of the brutal truth that wanting to help others is a weakness.

"Sad times."

Ludwig stares at her at Louise's outburst.

"......, yes."

"Those were the days, but......."

Louise exhales a white breath in the falling snow.

"Let's get on with life."

"......."

"Come on, let's survive."

It's a take-it-or-leave-it world, but you can't take it for granted.

Ludwig stares at Louise, stunned by her outburst.

"Yes, you should."

Ludwig laughed, and Louise smiled back.



* * *



What the hell, lady.

Why is she here?

"Who....... sister?"

Heinrich jumped out of his seat with a dumbfounded look on his face at the improbable visitor, and Ellen came down from her perch by the window to pet me.

Louise von Schwarz.

Someone who shouldn't have been there appeared out of nowhere.

"I, too, will be resting in the temple for the winter."

"And your sister......?"

"Yeah."

Louise merely told Heinrich that with her usual stiff expression.

No, can you explain a little more?

Whether Nana Heinrich was embarrassed or not, Louise looked at Ellen.

"I don't know about you, but I don't think I've ever seen this before......."

"Hello."

Ellen bowed her head in the manner of a friend's sister, not the princess and military commander of Cernstadt.

Louise next looks at me, sitting still on the window sill.

"Is this the cat?"

Does he know about the cat that showed up at the Royal Class Garrison? Louise wasn't too surprised to see the black cat.

"Yes."

Ellen scooped me up and held me out to Louise for her to touch.

What it is.

You're treating me like a way to talk to strangers now?

Uh.

That's convenient.

Louise stared at the cat (me) for a long time, then patted me on the head. As a matter of courtesy.

"......."

"......."

After Louise petted the cat a few times, Ellen looked at Louise.

They don't just stare, they stare.

What do you think?

How's my kid?

Say it fast.

Tell me it's cute.

That desire is evident in his eyes.

Louise could feel the slight panic in Ellen's eyes.

"That....... ears, they're cute......."

"That's right."

After being forced to take me in, Ellen tickled my hair.

Louise's look at Ellen is pretty hilarious.

They don't know each other, but they've never had a conversation, so Louise has no idea who Ellen is.

And you're a warrior who brags about your cat.

Was I disappointed or did I think it was humanizing.

But Ellen aside, Heinrich was still in a semi-panic.

"My sister....... How did this happen......."

"They told me to stay in room A-1. Where is that?"

Why is this person here anyway?

The Temple is not a place for just anyone to enter now, and Louise von Schwarz is certainly not just anyone.

I'm pretty sure it was Bertus who granted me access.

What does it mean to let Louise into the temple anyway?

Louise was allowed to live in room A-1 in the sophomore dormitory.

As it turns out, the room had been used by the emperor when he was a student at the Temple.

While King Cernstadt is to take command of the army for the winter, Louise takes a long vacation at the Temple.

Heinrich was frozen in place by the absurdity of the situation, while Louise looked up and down in wonder.

"This is the Temple......."

I don't know if she's comparing it to the academy in Cernstadt, or if it's something else entirely, but I can tell by the look on her face that she's pretty excited.

Heinrich disappeared somewhere with Louise, offering to give her a little tour of the royal class dormitories, leaving Ellen to watch the snow fall from the window.
