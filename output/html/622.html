            Episode 622.





The Allies are supposedly on their way, but we won't need them anymore. That's why most of us are on standby, but Riana has been given special privileges.

Absolute stability.

Literally.

Riana, who has the property of making it rain when she cries, has to take a special drug to control her weather. Something like a depressant.

As a result, Riana's powerful abilities require her to expend mental energy, not physical energy.

So what I usually ask her to do is to cut back. Because if she's on depressants all the time and they wear off, she's not going to have the strength to do it when she needs it.

As a result, Riana usually spends her days in the mansion as a form of recuperation.

The last time I used the ability was to melt a heavy snowfall on the ecliptic.

We drank tea until Elion Bolton and the Duchess returned.

Although not as much as it used to be, the villa still has occupants. It's one of the few places in Edina where you can live like royalty.

"You're going to convert me?"

"If you can."

"Hmmm....... Do I really need to go that far? It doesn't look like I'm going to get in trouble."

Correct.

Unlike Herriot, who teased me about being a punk, this one was a real punk.

And just as I didn't understand Charlotte and Olivia's intentions in converting Elijah Bolton, I didn't understand Riana's either.

I even took it to mean that Elion Bolton was about to have a mental breakdown in case he got into an accident.

"We don't have anything to do, so we're going to do mental training for a retired uncle?"

"I don't know about the other kids, but you don't really have anything to do."

"Well, yeah, but......."

She's a tough cookie, but she's still not compatible with him!

"Depending on the circumstances, we may have to reinstate Lord Bolton, and we're preparing for that."

Charlotte spoke on my behalf.

"Lottery......?"

"That means we're sending him back to the front."

"......Did you think I didn't know the word lottery when I asked you?"

"How do you know?"

Riana's mouth opens slightly at my words.

This.

"That's really bad, what do you think I am?"

It's like trying to pretend to know something and never finding the real thing.

No. Why do you know?

But what are you.

"You're a lucky bitch to have met a man of your caliber."

"......."

"......."

Was that harsh?

Sparks begin to fly across Riana's silent forehead.

-fazik! fazik!

"Really?"

"Do it?"

"Shut up! What are you doing like children?"

Charlotte sighed, looking back and forth between me and Riana, wondering if it was pathetic to bicker in the middle of a serious conversation.

Riana looks at Charlotte and shakes her head.

"Well, technically, we're still kids."

Right.

But I'm not a kid.

He's not a kid by any stretch of the imagination.

"......."

"Why is your face rotten?"

"No....... I did it all wrong."

At my apology, both Charlotte and Riana looked puzzled.

I'm getting old, and I'm scratching my head like I'm going to beat this kid. You're worse than I thought!

"Why haven't you broken the habit of saying things you shouldn't?"

"That's right."

Really? Why can't I grow up?

Is it too late?

"What do you mean you're going to reinstate him anyway?"

"It's not set in stone, but while the Zodiacal Cultists are out of the picture, there may be some pushback from the Paladins of the Allied Command. We're aiming to deify the entire Order of the Lord, which means it'll be easier to do so if our new leader, Elayon Bolton, can use the divine powers of a demon."

"Oh....... I see."

Riana nodded slowly, as if she finally understood what he meant.

Elayon Bolton would have been forced to cooperate with me even if the popes were still alive. But by choosing Rowen, he has given me the option of deifying the Church of the Lord itself. I could reinstate him now, but I'm sure he'd recognize that rebelling against me would create an even greater crisis.

However, Rowen hasn't failed yet, and if he does, and it becomes necessary to reinstate Bolton, it's just as well that he's fully bought into the Cult's banner by then.

Charlotte takes a sip of her tea.

He's a lot different than he used to be, but there's still a certain elegance in the way he sips his tea.

I'm watching Charlotte, and grace is a very strange thing.

It's like elegance, but it's not. It's not ostentatious, it's subtle, and if you try to imitate elegance and overdo it, it looks ridiculous.

I don't think about it, I just do what I normally do, and that's what feels elegant.

Elegance embodied. That would be classy.

Something's up.

It makes my heart skip a beat or something.

Anyway, is there such a thing?

"Hmm? You have guests."

I don't know how much they talked about it. The Duchess and Elayon Bolton returned to the manor.

Duchess Yelena de Granz.

And former Crusader Knight Elayon Bolton.

"Hello, Duchess. It's been a while since I've seen you."

"It's been a long time since I've seen you, Empress, and the Demon King is in high spirits."

"Oh, yeah......."

Charlotte stood up and bowed properly, and I stumbled to my feet and scratched the back of my head.

Elegance.

I don't really know what it is, but I'm pretty sure I won't have it until I die.

"Did you come to see me?"

As if on cue, Elion Bolton turned to me and Charlotte with a stern look on his face.

Okay, time to get down to business. Charlotte looks at me.

"Reinhardt?"

"Uh."

When I gave her a determined look, she smiled and pointed out the window.

"You're out."

"......?"

"I'm better off without you."

"Me, I'm a seat-wetter too......! Cover up when you cover up!"

Riana is your friend!

I wouldn't do that to Elion Bolton!

Charlotte's expression turned cold at my plea.

"Get out."

"Yes......."

I was eventually kicked out.



* * *



Charlotte and Elayon Bolton stayed behind because they had something important to say, while Liana and the Duchess left the manor.

And I was kicked out.

Riana giggled at me.

"You look good, so why would you say something you didn't have to and ruin what little credit you have?"

"Shouldn't it be assumed that I trusted Charlotte so much that I handed her an important position?"

No?

"You know it didn't look like that at all."

Yeah, I know it's not.

Negotiations, politics. I don't know much about it, and it's not my cup of tea.

I'm grateful that Charlotte does that for me and thinks harder than I do.

Hmm?

But if you're going to do that, why am I here?

I thought we were supposed to leave that to Charlotte.

Oh, I'd be sitting there if I didn't have to come and have a useless argument with Riana.

A king who's deposed by his regent is not a good look.

It's true that I was hoping for something like that, but I was hoping for a relationship where we could be comfortable with each other rather than an overly hierarchical relationship.

Naga.

That was a bit much.......

I'll definitely say sorry later.......

I'm not just saying it, I'm actually going to say it.......

In the end, I had nothing to do until Charlotte finished her story, so I walked along the beach.

Me, the Duchess, and Riana.

I don't know about Riana, but I don't see the Duchess very often.

"I hear the Allies are on the march again?"

"What? Ah....... Yes, it looks like we'll be leaving in a few days."

I asked if the Duchess had any idea of what was going on in the world, as I'm sure she had heard from Riana.

Ever since I went from being her daughter's friend to being her king, and ever since I came here, the Duchess has been hard on me.

To be honest, my first impression was never a good one.

Not only did she frown upon her daughter hanging out with the lower class, but she would call Harriet to breakfast alone.

He was a very status-conscious person, a very secular person.

His relationship with the Duke of Granz was already very bad.

In the end, however, the Duchess of Granz seemed to have undergone a profound change of heart after the Duke's death.

She urges him to reconcile with his daughter, avenge his father, and reveal that the real killer of Duke Granz was not the Devil.

People change.

A snob can't stay a snob forever.

It is also possible for a person to become a worldly person.

A formerly evil person can become good.

A good person can become evil.

People change.

Whether it's big or small, we all change over the course of our lives.

Duchess Granz has changed, I have changed, Riana has changed.

And Charlotte, and Elion Bolton.

It will change and change and change.

"Are you leaving this time like last time?"

"I think we'll just have to wait and see, but I'm not sure what's going to happen, because if it's not bad, we won't have to fight it, but I'm not sure."

"I see......."

The Duchess sighs at my words.

It was a sigh of relief.

It was only then that I realized that I had been so lost in my own thoughts that I hadn't thought about it at all.

The Duchess is sending her daughter off to war. A battlefield of death and terror, infested with terrible monsters. No parent would be happy to send their daughter off to war, even if she was a powerful psychic.

Moreover, the more she uses her powers, the more her mind is torn apart. You can't help but notice that she's torn between surviving the war and leaving Anigo behind.

As the Duchess, I would be the one who keeps taking her daughter to war.

So, you're not going to like him.

It's not something I've seen often, but the fact that the Duchess didn't reveal that to me, I couldn't help but realize that she's actually a person who hides her heart well.

He's the kind of guy who keeps sending his kids off to war.......

What if it were me.

If I had a child and a friend of my child's kept telling me that he needed my son or daughter's abilities and kept taking them to war.

If you've made it so far, but you don't know how long you'll be safe.

I'm lucky I haven't gotten caught so far.

Riana is so needed.

Parents' worries, grief, and fears should be ignored.

"May I ask why you have spared Lord Bolton's life?"

I couldn't help but be taken aback by his abruptness.

I thought we were going for a walk together, so I thought we were getting along fine, but I guess we weren't." Riana's face hardened at the Duchess's offhand remark.

"Did Elion Bolton pull a fast one?"

I didn't think he'd do anything weird, but if he did it without my knowledge, I can't let him get away with it.

"Not at all."

The Duchess's expression was devoid of anything resembling anger toward Elayon Bolton.

"He's not a great conversationalist, but he's an honorable man of great intelligence, understanding, and caring."

I don't know if I like it, but I think it shows a lot of respect for Elion Bolton.

Then why are you asking me if I didn't kill it?

"It's not about Lord Bolton, it's about why you kept him alive."

Was the question completely unrelated to Elion Bolton's attitude or behavior?

That question was aimed at me in the first place, not Elion Bolton.

"...... I didn't think it was necessary."

If we didn't kill it like we did, we might find a new use for Elion Bolton.

At my words, the Duchess looks at me with a stony expression.

"Need....... Need......."

Then he walks away, muttering to himself.

Vibe.

It seemed to harden.

"When all this is over, what will you do with the empire?"

"Empire....... You mean?"

"Yes."

The Duchess's words made me feel like I had a stone in my throat.

Bertus killed Duke Granz.

Riana wants revenge, and so does the Duchess.

Bertus was a member of the imperial family.

As such, it was imperative that the empire's greatest threat, the Devil, be kept in check, as well as any revolutionary forces that could shake the empire to its foundations.

It was Bertus's definition, and it was what he had to live by.

Bertus was forced to kill Duke Granz.

But the Duchess has lost her husband, and Riana has lost her father.

It's no wonder they hate the Empire and Bertus.

The usual stuff.

Who I am is what I must do.

If it comes down to someone's righteous vendetta.

Where did the problem start, and who is really at fault?

If everyone does what they're supposed to do, and you can't blame them, and all that builds up is hate and anger and vengeance.

Is there something fundamentally wrong with the world?

"If I told you I wouldn't bring down the empire, would you hate me?"

"How can you hate it more than you already do?"

You're being honest, man.

"Mom, please."

"I have a lot to thank the Devil for, but you know I can't help but feel this way."

"......Why not?"

"You don't have to understand that."

"Is that ......?"

"Why should you understand that I don't like you?"

I couldn't help but be a little dumbfounded.

"Why try to make sense of so much when you're so confused you can't even see your own survival."

"......."

"Even you, who have taken on the karma of one nation and countless lives, why do you seek to preempt understanding?"

"......."

"You should hate people who hate you."

The Duchess looks at me and says

It was more of a childlike tone than advice or criticism.

"You must kill those who would kill you."

"......."

"Is that all?"

I didn't know what to say.

"Sometimes you have to kill those who don't want to kill you, sometimes you have to hate those who don't hate you, sometimes you have to take the breath of those who don't hate you."

"......."

"It is the life of a king to kill if necessary, even those who have loved you all their lives, even those who have never thought of betraying you. It is the life of a king to watch callously as the dying man dies in tears and fever, with a face stained with betrayal."

"......."

"Do you think there was anyone in history who became king with mercy, with gentleness, and with understanding?"

"...... wouldn't have been there."

"No nation has ever been built in a way that doesn't take, and those who aren't used to taking can't keep and can't have."

"......."

"But why, as a person, do you want to be king?"

With love, with understanding, with mercy.

There's no such thing as a history that brings the world together.

Taking away to take away, making mountains out of molehills.

They build golden towers of stolen things, and the greatest thieves in the world set thrones atop them.

That's a country.

Put a cap of stolen gold on it, and call it a crown, and he who wears it is king.

If you steal little, you're a thief; if you steal a lot, you're a mastermind and go down in history.

If a man steals everything in the world, no one calls him a thief.

I've already dethroned Edina, which is how it all started.

I started by snatching it too.

"Those who have struck down only those who deserved to be hated, only those who deserved to be hated, may be avengers and champions, but they cannot and should not sit on the throne of power."

Yes.

It's not about taking down people who deserve to be hated.

It's about making the fallen hate those who deserve it.

Emperor.

History is such a thing.

Sometimes you have to kill people who love you, and you have to be able to look them in the eye in their death with a sense of betrayal.

As a human being, it is arrogance to try to be a king.

The Duchess is pointing out my arrogance.

Are you so good as a human being that you want to be king?

How can you protect everyone when you're acting like such an ass?

Such a you.

You use my daughter, but can you protect her?

It's an accusation.

"You might get neighbors this way, but aren't neighbors the most terrifying thing in the world?"

A neighbor can always be on your side.

But it was always the neighbor who took something away.

Neighbors are equals.

So, kings don't need neighbors.

To a king, all things must be subordinate.

As Bertus once said.

That kind of arrogance, like everyone below me is equal.

There has to be a different kind of arrogance than the one we have now.

You have to be in that position.

Duchess Granz looks at me.

"I hate you for not being cruel."

It wasn't just that she hated me for taking her daughter to war.

This is how you can live in peace, with your enemies still alive.

It's pointing out the fact that, while keeping him alive may have served a purpose, it didn't serve a purpose in the end.

She doesn't hate Elion Bolton.

He seemed to think my approach of keeping Elion Bolton alive was risky.

You don't want a king who takes his daughter to war.

But if you have a king who doesn't have the heart to kill his enemies properly, if you have a king who is driven by recognition and perfection without regard to defending your country properly, if you have a daughter living in that land.

You'll hate the king even more.

The war will eventually end, but an indecisive, soft-hearted king will perpetually jeopardize the kingdom.

"A king must kill harmless things, even his own dog now and then."

This method doesn't try to kill Elion Bolton, regardless of his usefulness.

Not to kill those who have not revealed their teeth to me.

Something that only tries to kill the unwilling.

It didn't seem to like the way I was trying to kill only those who were clearly my enemies.

Duchess Granz speaks like a child.

"Are you going to convince the sheep inside the fence that their appetites can't be helped, when there are wolves and packs of ewes roaming outside the fence, and you don't even know if they're wolves in dog skins or not, and you're safe because you haven't shown them to me?"

The Duchess had no words to reply.

Elion Bolton was not a wolf.

The Duchess knew it.

But he doesn't know if it's a dog or a wolf, and he blames me for letting it into the fence because he doesn't need to kill it.

At some point, you're going to let a wolf in a dog's skin inside the fence.

That's what they say.

"That is the most dangerous tyranny of all."

A king who dispenses death harshly would be a tyrant.

A king who values death too much is a dark king.

"The Devil."

The Duchess kneels before me.

And, desperate.

Appeal.

"Be a cruel monarch."

A king and a saint are two different things.

If you try to be a king in the manner of a saint, you'll have nothing, you'll keep nothing.

Duchess Granz pleaded.
