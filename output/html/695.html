            Episode 695.





The battle was not long.

Thirty-five total.

Reinhardt's sword was deflected by Ellen, who held the laments suspension, with a half-sword, slicing through the gap in the dynamo and sending his entire body crashing to the white sand.

-Bang!

The fight ended with Ellen climbing onto Reinhardt's chest as he lay half on the white sand, and placing the blade of her ramen at the nape of his neck.

Their blades and faces were close enough to touch.

"It's dead."

"......Yes."

Ellen says, and Reinhard nods.

I even found myself laughing at the subjugated subject, as if I had just wanted to hear those words from Ellen.

The fight didn't last long, but the white sandy beach was torn to shreds by two men who had already become monsters.

"Do you want to do more?"

Ellen asks, holding the ramen to her throat.

"No."

There's something you can tell from the moment you cross swords.

Ellen couldn't help but realize that Reinhardt hadn't thought he'd win in the first place.

Ellen knows.

Even if you do it a hundred times.

Ellen knew she was going to win.

So Reinhardt would have known.

Rising from Reinhard's crushed body, Ellen helps him to his feet.

"I guess I can't beat you."

No sword, including Ellen's, can defeat her.

That's still the case.

"Why do you have to beat me?"

"Actually, I don't really want to win."

Reinhardt laughs.

"I just like it."

"......."

"I don't care if I lose or win."

Reinhard watches the waves roll in.

Pushing, breaking, reversing, pushing, breaking, reversing again.

Watching that eternal push.

"It's just that we can do it."

I didn't want to win or lose, I just wanted to have this moment where we could cross swords.

If you win, so do I.

If you have

And then there will be one.

An eternity in a place that has nothing to do with winning or losing.

I wanted a continuation of these moments.

Reinhardt says.

Ellen doesn't know how Reinhardt managed to subdue her.

How the heck did they do it.

I still haven't beaten myself.

How in the world could I have subdued and saved myself when I was possessed by a demon that was stronger than I am now.

Ellen still doesn't know.

Reinhardt didn't seem to mind telling me.

Eventually, Reinhardt saw what he wanted to see.

Ellen and herself, and who's stronger.

Ellen is stronger.

We found that the gap was still unbridgeable.

I could lose forever, I just wanted to win once.

I knew that after that one victory, I would only lose, just like before.

"As you can probably tell, you're officially dead."

Finally, Reinhardt says what he's been dying to say.

Hearing that, Ellen's breath seemed to catch in her throat.

The thought of telling a real story scared me.

You feel choked up and scared because you don't know what you're going to hear.

The demon captured the fake warrior and executed him.

We don't know what kind of theater this is.

However, the warrior is dead.

It did.

"We forced them to bring their representatives to watch a public execution. They had a good look."

Reinhardt chuckles.

It stinks.

I couldn't help but think about it.

To the representatives of the Human Autonomous Territories, forced to watch as their hopes were executed.

It's brutal, but it will work.

The dead thing is probably a doll or something.

It shouldn't be hard to create something like that.

"This will put those bastards to sleep, and slowly disintegrate the Autonomy."

"......."

"There won't be anybody projecting false hope on you, and you won't have to feel pressured by that."

There will be no more prayers, prayers that Ellen will never hear, for the salvation of mankind as it groans under the oppression of a selfish demon.

Now that the symbol of hope, the warrior, is dead, it is impossible to do such a thing, even with a flame.

"Now you will not be in the world, no one will need you, no one will ask you to do the impossible. The warrior was defeated by the demon, and he died. That's the end of the story."

"......."

"People will forget you."

Reinhard looks at Ellen.

"Now, what excuse would you use to run away?"

"......."

"You know you can't run away, and you want to run away."

At that, Ellen bites her lip and lowers her head.

"You don't seem to be able to stand being with me."

It's all in the facial expressions.

They know without you telling them.

The moment itself is agonizing.

At the end of it all, Ellen could only shudder and open her mouth.

"I'm sorry....... I'm sorry......."

No matter what the reason, how reasonable it was, or how necessary it was.

He leaves without speaking to Reinhardt, who ultimately saves him.

It's been five years since then.

That time has changed a lot.

"......."

"If you're sorry, can you stay with me now?"

Ellen's jaw dropped.

Is there still room for me?

What's left for me to do?

I wish I could say I would, but I couldn't.

Too carefree.

To the topic that left me, to the topic that I tried to run away from and ended up getting caught.

He naturally says he'll stay with you now that everything's settled.

It's a flip of the palm that changes your attitude.

To sit in this cozy prison and make sense of it all.

Not too much.

Not being too selfish.

"Can't you do it?"

"Black....... ugh....... ugh......."

Eventually, Ellen begins to cry over it.

No, no, no.

I can't say either way.

I'm sorry to say no.

I'm even guilty of saying I want to.

At some point, I started making excuses and running away.

At the end of the day, I feel so pathetic for being caught and crying.

It's too hard.

So lonely.

So lonely.

I was sick all the time.

I want to say that, but I can't bring myself to say it.

Finally, after a three-month hiatus, they have a proper conversation.

A conversation that ended in tears.

"I don't know, I don't know....... I don't think I deserve this....... I don't think I do....... I, I don't think I should....... I don't think I'm qualified....... I don't think I have......."

"Who gives you the right to do that?"

"I don't know. Ha, but....... I don't think I should do this....... Someone like me....... I don't think I should....... I don't think I should....... What I did to you....... What I did to the world....... You know....... But what right do I have to....... What right do I have to......."

Reinhardt grabs Ellen's chin with his cold eyes and forces her to look up.

"Yeah, I knew it would be like this."

"I didn't think you could handle being with me after all."

"Whether it's self-blame or guilt. Or that I've been away too long, or whatever."

"The reason you left me in the first place, and it was something I could have done something about."

"The reason you left five years ago was actually just a shoehorned in reason, you just couldn't live with yourself."

"I didn't leave because I had to."

"You just left because you wanted to leave."

"If you just wanted to be by my side in the first place, you could have done that, and there are tons of ways to do that, and you know it."

If I wanted Ellen to be with me in some way, there was a way.

It's just that Ellen couldn't allow herself to do it.

So I left.

Even now, when all the other reasons to leave are gone, the fact that he won't allow himself to be with me is proof of that.

"You just, you can't allow yourself to do that."

"I thought you were the cause of all this."

"You betrayed me, and I don't think you deserve it."

"You know I don't want that, you know I don't blame you, I just can't forgive you."

"That's why you're crying now. Even now, when it doesn't matter that you're with me anymore, you're still forcing yourself to do this penance, just because you feel vaguely guilty."

"Torturing yourself doesn't make you better, it doesn't make you different."

"Where is the reason or necessity for that?"

"There is no such thing as....... doesn't exist."

At Reinhardt's words, Ellen rolls her eyes.

"I know....... I know......."

"I realize I'm doing this....... I know that what I'm doing isn't helping anything or anyone....... If anything, it's hurting you and it's hurting me....... I know."

"I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself for being stupid......."

"But I don't know....... If only I had done better then, if only I had believed. I can't get those thoughts out of my head....... I can't forgive myself for what I did, for what I did because I didn't want to forgive myself, for what I did because I didn't want to forgive myself......."

"I don't think I should be with you. I don't know what to do with this vicious cycle......."

"I know it wasn't all me, but I can't say it wasn't. If I'm even a little bit comfortable, if I'm even a little bit happy, I can't stand myself......."

"I can't even imagine such a thing......."

"Oh my God, I know I'm an idiot, but I know....... I know this won't bring the dead back....... I know that guilt can't buy me anything, and I know that it can't undo anything....... I know, but I can't throw it away....... I can't do it......."

"I know I'm only hurting you by doing this, but....... I don't know, I guess I just lost my mind at some point....... I don't know if this is the right idea....... I can't do this....... I feel like I'm broken......."

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry for running away, I'm sorry for betraying you, I'm sorry for not trusting you, and I'm sorry for wanting to run away even after all this, and I'm sorry for not telling you I'd stay with you....... But....... But......."

"Stop. Stop. Your mind, I get it."

"......."

Reinhardt catches Ellen in the act of confessing her bullshit guilt.

To Ellen, who is too guilty to look him in the eye, and who is feverishly clenching her eyes shut, the Devil speaks.

"You know the mansion you were in until today, and what this deserted island means."

"......Yes."

A prison built to create a situation from which there is no escape.

Putting them in a place where they can't get away.

"I know you're going to do this, so I've prepared this place."

If I can't change your mind, I'll lock you in a place you can never escape.

This is where that idea became a reality.

"When I saw you again, I didn't have much of an idea what to do."

"Because you're not going to be able to stand yourself."

"This is the result of what Harriet and I were thinking."

Ellen shuddered at the name she hadn't heard in a long time.

"I'm not even a wizard, so how could I have sent you here in the first place?"

Weird traps you've fallen into and spatial movements you didn't even notice.

Ellen couldn't help but realize that was actually what Harriet had done.

"Because I'm sure you're going to say something like, "You're going to run away screaming like a dog.""

"Because you're that kind of guy."

"Brutal."

"Because if left alone, you'll be even more cruel to yourself than this."

"It seemed like the only way to go."

It's good for a reason.

Herriot knew the moment she left that Ellen Artorius would be on the run for the rest of her life, and the Devil knew it too.

Even now, I'm crying that I shouldn't have.

Just be hard on yourself.

How can you choose to be happy if you don't think you deserve it?

The Emperor knew that Ellen's fundamental mindset would not change and that she would eventually try to escape.

So I tried to force it.

Locked.

Incarcerate.

I wanted to tie him down where he couldn't escape, and this is the result of that thinking.

Small islands and mansions in the Great Sea of Doom.

I thought locking her in a place where she wouldn't know which way to run might be the way to stop her self-pity.

I'll just have to deliver the supplies I need, and I'll slowly come to terms with this life, if not embrace it.

Otherwise, you'll just accept it with resignation.

Reinhardt's words reveal what he's thinking.

I couldn't argue with the fact that he was going to keep trying to run away.

Even Ellen knows by now that she's going to get away with it, for whatever reason.

"By the way."

"It turns out......."

"This is, like, weird."

"No matter how you slice it, you can't tie them down, you can't lock them up, you can't imprison them."

"This can't be right."

"So....... I created this place, and I've been watching you....... and I've been watching you......."

"This is what happens."

"Because you're stuck in this place, right in front of me."

"I see you've been sleep deprived and you're sulking."

"I don't think so, either."

"I don't think this is the way to do it."

"In the end, it's going to make you sicker."

The demon releases Ellen's jaw.

In fact, I've been struggling with it since I've been in this situation.

I don't deserve this.

I knew I couldn't run away, so I stayed put.

I was in agony.

Another self-pity party.

I'm not supposed to be happy.

You may be stuck, but you'll accept it.

It was clear he was going to get sick.

The Devil stares at Ellen as she cries.

If you lock her up, you'll be able to keep her in this place forever.

But Ellen will curl up in a ball, unforgiving and unconvinced.

It can be suboptimal, but not suboptimal.

It's like putting a bluebird in a cage and taking it out to pet it whenever you want.

Therefore, when the demon saw the reality that had become his idea, he could not help but think that it was not right after all.

"The Darklands were destroyed, the Ancestral Demon killed. Since arriving in the ecliptic, I have been unable to live in my demon form."

"Disguising it as magic could only go so far."

"It was impossible to live as a demon."

"To live among men, I needed a human form, and that is the Reinhardt you know."

"So."

-shoot

Wavy shores.

In a prison named Island, built for only one person.

The demon cautiously. He pulls something from the ring finger of his left hand.

Ellen is horrified, but she can't help but stare at the demonic figure.

"This ring, which allows me to blend into the world, is the most important object that has made all of this possible."

Rings.

It was the first time Ellen realized Reinhardt had ever worn a ring like this.

Since the ring was for camouflage, even its shape could be hidden.

Reinhardt, back in his demonic form, holds still and grabs Ellen's left hand.

"I've created a world where it's okay for me to be a demon, and I don't need it anymore."

"So, you know, you can't live anywhere with that look."

"There shouldn't be anyone walking around who looks exactly like a dead warrior."

"I can live with the way I look now."

"Now you can't live with yourself."

"So, I'll give it to you."

"Because now you'll need it more than I will."

"And I'll send you back."

The demon carefully places the ring on Ellen's left ring finger.





The ring, which was supposed to be the wrong size, turned out to be the perfect size for Ellen's finger.

Ellen stares at him, dumbfounded by the suddenness of the ring, and asks, shakily, "What is it?

"Is this....... what is it?"

"What I could have been Reinhardt, what I could have been a cat."

"......."

Dreadfind's Ring.

As the last Archdemon, the ring was actually the thing that made everything possible.

But now we don't need it.

So, give it to someone who can't live in the world without it.

You try to keep them locked up for the rest of their lives, and then you finally admit that you were wrong.

"It's good for me, too."

"People like you rotting away in a place like this, it's kind of a loss."

"Just like this time, when you gave me a very important piece of information. You'll do something again, something of your own."

"Because it's good for you, and it's good for me."

"I won't hold you back."

"So."

"You're free."

It gives you complete freedom, which is the opposite of confinement.

The chance to hold on to it forever, and finally let it go.

"With this, people won't know you're Ellen Artorius, and you won't have to go looking for no-man's land like you do now. You can just be normal, blend into the world and be a nobody."

If she lives as someone else, she's really gone from the world.

You can move in and out of the city normally, get an identity, and live as a completely new person.

"Do you know what I mean?"

Dazed, Ellen stares at the unknown ring on her hand.

"If you want to get out of here and get away from me, if you want to hide, I'll never find you again. If you decide to run away, I'll never see you again."

Having found the hero, the demon gives him the means to escape for good.

If Ellen decides to hide, the devil will never find her again.

"But it's also something that can come to you whenever you want."

It's something you can run away from forever.

But if you use it a little differently, you can always take it to see Reinhardt.

You can't even get around the ecliptic in the form of Ellen Artorius, but with the power of the Ring, you can.

Whether to use it as a way to escape for good.

It's up to Ellen to decide if she wants to use it as a key to an everlasting encounter.

The demon gently grabs the tip of the frozen warrior's left finger.

"So......."

"Instead of putting you in a place like this."

"I'm not going to force you to do anything else."

"Where you want to go, what you want to do. I'm going to give you complete freedom to do it all."

"I just need one favor."

"Once every few months."

"Once every few years."

"Because it's good."

"Sometimes."

"Sometimes, really."

"Come see me."

"That's it."

"That's good enough for....... because that's good enough."

"I don't even want more."

"It's not like you and I have to do something really, really great together."

"Like now, practicing swordplay."

"Make something to eat."

"We'll just get together and talk about nothing like we used to."

"Yeah, because it's nice to do something simple and trivial."

"It's okay to be together sometimes."

"There's no compelling reason why you shouldn't do that."

"You said you knew."

"You said you knew you were weird."

"Because that's all I'm going to ask of you."

"You give yourself permission to do that."

"So......."

"Self-flagellation, which only causes you and me pain....... Now, let's stop."

With those words, the tears that I had barely stopped escaped my eyes.

"ugh....... Ugh....... Black! Hmph!"

That's about it.

It's also not asking for too much.

"Come on, that's not too much to ask."

The devil was gritting his teeth, too.

It's like the devil to hold in anger and rage.

The same goes for the demon, who somehow manages to keep his eyes locked with the crying Ellen.

"So....... for me?"

After imprisoning the warrior you've managed to find, you set him free.

Give the gift of freedom.

I'll give you something you can leave forever.

I'm leaving for good, but I ask you not to.

Deciding to let go, not hold on.

I'm just making a promise.

It won't be very thick, and it won't be very solid.

Let's put one unbreakable thread between them.

If it's too hard to give yourself permission to look at yourself and you feel guilty, you don't have to do it all the time.

I'll see you around.

That's about as far as you can go.

You can give yourself that much, can't you?

Wouldn't it be too harsh on both of us to not allow even that?

It doesn't have to be that harsh, does it?

Now we're done.

You can give yourself that much credit.

That's what the devil says.

I knew that if I tried to pick him up, he would die in my arms, so I gave him a place in the world where he could live fully.

Return it to the world.

As always, live your life doing what only you can do.

It's okay to be where you're supposed to be, whether it's to pay off a debt or for whatever reason.

But sometimes.

When you're tired, overwhelmed, or just plain lonely.

Sometimes it's okay to come back and take a break.

I'll take that.

Eternal punishment is yours if you want to live it.

There's no such thing as a moment of redemption.

Allow yourself a small, occasional respite.

In the face of a demon who, in the end, chose to let go of attachment, who chose to let go even though he could have what he wanted.

You can't push it any further.

With nothing but gratitude and appreciation.

You must answer.

So, somehow, some way, Ellen manages to make that ugly face she's had all along.

While trying to make it look smiley.

"ugh, ugh....... Yeah......."

And I end up looking even more like a mess, with a mixture of tears and laughter.

-shoot

On a wavy beach.

On a beach where the waves will crash and break forever.

It promises another eternity.

Just like that.

Warriors.

"Please....... Please......."

Demon family.

Thin.

never to be broken.

"Sure, I'll do it."

They made a covenant, small and everlasting.
