            Episode 574.





The choice to meet Bertus or not was always mine.

Bertus knows I'm helping the Allies advance, but he has no idea where I am, and I can always predict where he will be.

Bertus will be traveling between the three locations.

Tetra, the central palace of Neptune.

Allied Garrison Commander-in-Chief.

And now.

"It's a pretty obvious place, isn't it?"

"Yes, obviously....... I see."

The University of Magic research building in front of me.

Bertus must be traveling to and from one of these three locations.

The Imperial Palace is the Imperial Palace, and the Allied Garrison is the Allied Garrison.

And since there is a very important research project going on in the College of Witchcraft and Wizardry research building, I'm sure I'll be visiting from time to time to keep an eye on things.

"If it's that heavily guarded on the outside, it must be harder to get inside."

No matter how sarcastic you are, no is no.

"Still, rather than risk your Majesty, I would rather......."

"Forget it, how long am I going to have to ask you to do everything for me?"

"That's true, but......."

It's not that I didn't want to do it, but the idea of sending Sarkeghar to the Black Order had long since passed me by.

That doesn't mean Sarkegaard doesn't have a job to do.

Sarkhegar will wait for Bertus to appear nearby.

"Bertus won't attack you anyway, just like he won't attack me. If he shows up here, approach him and tell him I need to talk to him, and then we can talk privately......."

Before I could finish.

In the distance, I could see Bertus and Saviolin Tana exiting the research building.

The fact that I was able to spot them so quickly is more a sign of the emperor's frequent visits than a coincidence.

"Less work."

"Your Highness....... Just one more thought......."

"It's okay."

You can be okay with not being okay.

Leaving a worried Sarkegar behind, I began to approach the research wing of the School of Magic.



* * *



Emperor Bertus does not like to travel with large armies.

Not one to shy away from protocol, Bertus ascended to the throne in a time of crisis. It was a time when such things could not be afforded, so ceremonies were either eliminated or scaled back to the point of excess.

This is not to say that we don't have "lots" of troops, but that we don't value security.

Most of the time, Bertus traveled with the viola tana. That's enough bodyguarding for now.

And when you're going to a place that's supposed to be confidential, you obviously can't take a lot of people with you. So when Bertus is traveling, his bodyguard is always Saviolin Tana, who takes care of everything.

As a result, Xavier Tana has become more than just the head of the Chanapelle, but also the Emperor's personal assistant to some extent.

Of course, when the allied armies are marching or there is a battle, others will take over the guard, but now that he's been hit, Bertus is moving with Savior Tana.

So Bertus stopped by the research wing, and he and Tana were on their way back to the palace.

With so few people inside the temple, the streets were deserted, and Bertus and Saviolin Tana were the only ones walking down the orderly but grimy streets.

"You're on track."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"If it's too smooth, that's a problem."

Bertus smiled bitterly, and Tana stiffened, unable to find the words.

"By the way, I didn't expect the three of you to make this much progress so quickly......."

Bertus sighs.

"No matter how many continents we've gathered from, the Royal Class sophomores are incredibly special."

Adelia, the creator of the Titan and Power Cartridge.

Christina, the creator of Moonshine.

And Louis Ankton and Anna De Guerna.

Emperor.

Empress.

Warriors.

And the devil.

The second year of Royal Class is an uncanny breed. So much so that some powerful destiny is felt.

"What about you, Ludwig, by the way?"

"ah......."

Saviolin Tana's complexion has changed.

"It's....... seems to be having a hard time adjusting."

"......I guess my thinking was short."

When Bertus thought about what Ludwig would face in the Guard, he couldn't help but wonder if he had made a mistake in assigning him to the Guard.

Bertus has a lot of work to do, too. So while he cares about Ludwig, he can't give him the attention he deserves.

"Maybe you should take a job at a training center instead."

"I'll ask Ludwig's doctor."

"Yes, and this time......."

-Angel

Bertus stopped talking at the sound of a cat in the distance.

Neither Tana nor Bertus could do anything but stare at the black cat standing still in the middle of a wide, deserted street.

"Um....... That one?"

"You're a cat."

-Angel

The black cat slowly approaches the emperor.

"It's not just a cat, Lord Tana."

"If you say that's......?"

"Ellen's cat."

"ah......."

"I know it was unavoidable in the garrison, but I'm not sure it's right to let them run loose like this in the temple. I can understand not wanting to keep them locked up......."

"Ugh. I've never had a cat, so I don't know......."

It's even weirder that Savior Tana, who's been holding a sword her whole life, should know how to raise a cat.

"By the way, you've come a long way from your dorm, do you even know how to get back?"

I met a cat wandering around in the middle of nowhere.

Had the cat ever roamed such a large area? Bertus didn't know.

But the black cat is coming toward Bertus.

This is strange, because last time I saw Bertus, he was scrambling to get away.

Bertus squats down to watch the approaching cat.

You might be lost, and Ellen might be worried.

"I think we should take him to the dorms first......."

The moment Bertus reaches out to lift the cat.

Suddenly.

The cat's body began to change.

-Kuruk

"!"

"Your Majesty, it's dangerous!"

Saviolin Tana harshly pulls Bertus away, keeping him at a distance.

The cat turns into something.

And then, in a flash, it took shape, and Bertus and Savior Tana froze in their tracks.

"Well, ....... Not for a long time, to be honest."

Black cat.

"It's been a while. Right?"

Reinhard the Demon appeared.



* * *



Ellen's cat has suddenly turned into a Reinhardt.

There's no way to know why, what the reason is, or what the purpose is.

Even if you don't understand the situation, what you see is what you get.

With Bertus hidden behind her, the pale-faced Saviolin Tana drew her saber.

"Wait. No more, no more approach."

Saviolin Tana's expression was tinged with fear, though not hostility.

Saviolin Tana wasn't the only one caught off guard.

"Reinhard......?"

Bertus swallowed hard, stunned by what was happening in front of him.

"I know you're shocked, but you know you're not here to fight, or you wouldn't have shown up like this."

If you were going to kill it, there were better ways to do it.

There's a reason why we're showing it up front.

"I'd like to talk to you somewhere quiet. It's been a while."

Just as time has changed many things, so has Reinhardt.

"If you stay out there too long like this, you're in trouble. You know that, right?"

The streets were deserted, but it was crazy to wander around the Temple as Reinhardt.

Bertus looks at Reinhardt, who has suddenly appeared, with a stony expression.

"Your Majesty......."

Saviolin Tana also stares at the Emperor with a confused expression.

"Okay. Anywhere is good, so let's go in."

Even the Emperor didn't like it when someone saw a demon in his temple.



* * *



Bertus and Tana are the only ones who know that the demon is helping humanity. That's why they know he's not here to fight when he suddenly reveals himself.

Most of the buildings in Temple were empty, including schools and shops.

So I went to the second floor of a nearby vacant storefront that used to be a cafe.

The door is locked, but that doesn't matter to anyone in the room.

Slashing the lock on the closed door with an auror blade, the three sat down.

The tables and chairs were dusty, but no one seemed to mind.

You only need the space anyway.

"I want to tell you something, but let's not talk about cats because it's not important and I don't want to."

Bertus looked at Reinhardt's vulnerable face and couldn't help but notice how he had changed over the years, if nothing else.

It's even more shameless than before.

"Yeah....... Let's call it that, because it's not like I have any idea why."

You would have wanted to keep an eye on Ellen.

We also learned why Ellen had a seizure when she tried to leave the cat with the emperor.

Reinhardt crosses his arms, muttering to himself.

"Let's not even talk about the good old days. Who did what, where did it go wrong, all that stuff."

Talking about fault is also pointless.

Talking about each other's responsibilities when there's only reality to be faced is only going to make things worse.

The demon warned the emperor that his men would cause a gate crisis if he did not release him, but the emperor refused to release the demon.

That's where the gates came in.

But there's no point in discussing it now.

We have a problem to face, and we have a job to do.

Everything else is pointless except to focus on it.

Bertus nodded at Reinhardt's words.

"You do realize we were clearing a path ahead of the Allies, right?"

"Yeah. I knew that."

Bertus looks at Reinhardt and asks.

"Can you really manipulate the weather?"

"To a limited extent."

Reinhardt doesn't say it's necessarily Liana de Granz's superpower.

Bertus' and Tana's faces hardened at the mention of something no mage could do.

"It's okay, you know what would have happened if you'd tried to use that power to destroy the human race."

"......."

"......."

If a demon were to go on a rampage in the middle of the ecliptic while the Allied forces were in full force, the ecliptic would be devastated.

Now, it's one thing to know that it might happen, but it's another thing to actually have verbal confirmation that the devil can do it if he puts his mind to it.

Humanity should have perished long ago, except for the mercy of the Devil.

But most people hate the devil without even realizing it.

It only takes a day for the Devil to really wipe out the human race, but no one thinks about that.

If the devil threatens the emperor with the very existence of humanity, it is the reality of the empire and of humanity that he must listen, no matter what he says.

However, so far, the Devil has never interfered with humanity in such a way.

"I'm not here to threaten or blackmail you, I'm just here to ask you a question."

Reinhardt asks quietly.

"One of our main sources of power is Death Knight. We used up a lot of it during the Battle of Serandia, so we tried to replenish it last time."

At that, neither Tana nor Bertus are silent, listening to Reinhardt's words.

"That's why I tried to resurrect him as a Death Knight in the Hall of Heroes in the Imperial Mausoleum."

"......what?!"

Bertus and Tana couldn't help but be stunned. To be told that they had tried to break into the imperial mausoleum at such an inopportune time would be astonishing.

"The method is secret, but I got in anyway."

Worse, they've already been breached without realizing it.

Bertus listens to the story with a pale face.

"But....... You see, the coffins are all empty."

"It's not just the imperial mausoleum. I've also confirmed that the bodies of Allied soldiers killed in action are being switched and buried in the national cemetery."

"Just like we tried to make Death Knight, it seems like the Empire is doing some crazy stuff....... I don't know."

"I've been trying to sneak up on them rather than make contact, but I knew I couldn't do that. That's why I came to you."

I'm not going to say, "You shouldn't be doing that, you shouldn't be doing that, you shouldn't be doing that, because I'm doing something similar."

"But you need to know what's what. Because I am, and my people are very uneasy, and you may have aligned yourselves with those who may be my enemies."

"I only have two questions."

The demon stares at the emperor.

"What are you doing at Temple College of Witchcraft and Wizardry?"

The substance of the study.

"You guys are in cahoots with the Black Order."

And suspicious alliances.

"You'll have to explain."

The devil asked two questions.

What research is being done at the Temple School of Magic.

And if they're in cahoots with the Black Order.

There is silence.

Tana couldn't speak before Bertus, so the demon only looked at Bertus.

I don't know if it's before the devil approaches, but the devil asks outright.

Unless you've done something like that, silencing the devil himself is impossible.

"I knew you were watching us, but....... It's kind of weird to realize that."

Bertus said with a bitter smile.

"Yes, we're doing something with the bodies of our fallen heroes."

Bertus nods slowly.

"But I don't know what you mean about the Black Order."

"...... is it?"

The Demon King stays still and watches the Emperor's expression.

It's hard to read intentions from facial expressions.

You can't tell if it's a sham or the truth just by looking at the face.

"They're not working with the Black Order, at least not that I know of."

With that, the Emperor shrugs.

"You don't have to doubt me, you know that, right?"

"What."

"After touching a dead body to end the Gate debacle, what's to say you couldn't recognize the hands of the Black Order, even if they were the ones who tried to kill you?"

It's a weird thing to say what you can and can't do when you're already doing terrible things.

"Are you saying that if the Black Order had come to you, you would have joined hands with them?"

"Yeah. But I didn't, and if I did, I don't think it's in my best interest to put you in this situation in the first place."

"Hmmm......."

In the words of Bertus.

There was nothing the Empire couldn't catch the hands of the Black Order at, with everything they had that could help them. Bertus grinned bitterly at the nervous-looking demon.

"I've found that when I tell the truth, people don't believe me."

Bertus laughed bitterly, saying that when you tell the truth, people doubt you.

"I can at least show you what we were doing."

The demon looked a little surprised, as if he hadn't expected that.





第 575 集





I knew that if I met with Bertus, we would have a conversation, and I knew that he would have to give in to my demands.

I chose to take the risk and meet Bertus in person.

It's not that I'm in danger of getting in trouble for meeting Bertus, or that he's in danger of getting in trouble for meeting me.

The fact that Bertus and I met.

It's dangerous if someone finds out about it later in some way.

So it wasn't hard to get to the bottom of it once I met and talked to Bertus in person. But I didn't expect them to show me what they were doing.

Bertus barked orders at Savior Tana.

Evict everyone in the Hogwarts research building for three hours.

I would change my appearance, of course, but it wouldn't do the Emperor any good to have anyone see that he had entered the laboratory with an unknown person.

Saviolin Tana left to deliver the order, and Bertus and I sat in the empty dining room talking until everything was ready.

"Charlotte is....... How is she doing?"

The look on Bertus' face when he asked that was complicated.

They once hated each other to the point of trying to kill each other, but at some point, Bertus began to feel sorry for Charlotte.

Bertus decided to execute Charlotte, but he was actually calling for me.

And I left, taking Charlotte with me.

Bertus wanted to save Charlotte.

"I've got my own job, and it's better than living in the palace."

"Is that......."

Bertus says with a sad look on his face.

"Thank you. Reinhard."

I wonder if he's thanking me for showing up to save Charlotte.

It will mean one thing, and it will mean something else.

My relationship with Bertus is much different than it was in the past.

Now Bertus was technically in a low position.

You don't want to know that I have less than you.

Guilt.

He felt incredibly guilty about it, and he's still using me to this day.

When Bertus heard of Charlotte's whereabouts, he seemed a little relieved.

It didn't lead to more conversations.

Three years is a long time, but in some ways it's not that long.

But those who survived those three years experienced too much.

The public conversation was over, and there were too many obstacles to have a private conversation.

You never know what the future holds.

"About the Gate debacle....... Is there anything else I should know?"

There wasn't much I could say to Bertus' question.

"Just do what you're doing now."

Last gate.

That was all I could say because it wasn't Bertus' business.



* * *



By the time Saviolin Tana returned, the Emperor's instructions had been carried out.

They all left the lab without leaving a single ant behind, and the guards cleared out.

Changing his face with the Ring of Sarkegar, he donned his robes and headed to the research wing of the School of Magic with Bertus.

"I don't think it would have been possible to sneak in here."

There were several layers of security checkpoints on the way into the underground lab alone, so it's unclear if even Sarkozy could have penetrated the system.

"Dreadfind might find a way. Coming to me directly would have been a convenient option, but not the only one."

Bertus held Sarkeghar captive for nearly two years.

So it was inevitable that I would learn about the Dreadfind clan.

"Anna and Christina suggested it first."

"......what?"

I don't know what that means, but I couldn't help but ask.

When he suggested it, he was obviously referring to this thing I'm about to see.

"Even if it's a terrible way to do it, if it helps end the gate crisis, is it okay to do it?"

"Anna and....... and Christina....... first?"

"Yeah. Louis joined us later."

They suggested it first, not Bertus.

No one is unchanged by the war, and comparisons to the original are now laughable.

Either because of terrible things, or because of something else.

Anna and Christina have come up with a way to reanimate the fallen and reintroduce them into battle, and they've even proposed it to the Emperor.

Just as Adelia created the Titans.

No.

Seeing Adelia's involvement in the Titan project may have inspired Anna and Christina to do something of their own.

Titans were not in the original.

Maybe the Titan inspired Anna and Christina, and that's why they thought of ways to contribute to the war in their own way.

"I thought about it. For a long time."

Bertus says as he descends into the underground laboratory.

"For a very....... very long."

It desecrates the bodies of the fallen, the bodies of those who were too good to die.

When he said he'd thought about it for a long time, I realized how much Bertus had agonized over the decision to accept the job.

In the end, Bertus would have said yes.

He may have even decided to use the tombs of heroes in the imperial mausoleum.

Just like that, I saw

What Bertus was working on after Titan.

"This is......."

Huge culture pots.

"This is undead?"

"......Yes."

There was a human body there, pristine, without a single wound.

From the looks of it, it was definitely not the body of someone who had died of trauma.

The other ports were no different.

It wasn't hard to figure out why the bodies of people who should have died of trauma were so clean and intact.

"Did you really....... played?"

"Yes, I'm regenerating flesh and muscles that have been lost or decayed."

It was a body that had been restored to near-original shape, not a body that had retained its original shape.

Such ports were placed throughout the underground lab.

"Homunculus is the alchemy that creates life."

"......Yes."

"So the homunculus is said to be a magic that creates something out of nothing, which is why it is said to have a high probability of failure, because you can't create life easily."

Bertus stares at the body of an unnamed person, still, eyes closed.

"The homunculus is that kind of magic that explores the truth of life, but we don't want to know the end of the homunculus technology, we want a homunculus that can be electrified, so we don't have to create something out of nothing."

"Is this a case of making something out of nothing?"

"Yeah."

More precisely, it's about breathing life back into something that was once dead.

"Making something that no longer functions as a living thing function again. I hear it's easier than building a real homunculus."

A homunculus creates a life form that never existed in the first place, but in this case, it's a reconstruction of a life form we already know.

If you have a good understanding of human anatomy, you can build a human, and the material was already human from the start.

Homunculus's arcane skills allow him to restore lost, damaged, or decayed organs, flesh, and muscle.

Not like the undead.

Undead are those that move while dead.

But it's about giving something resembling life to a dead body.

"It sounds like you can resurrect a dead person from....... from the dead."

"No, I'm not going to research that, and I don't think it's possible. I mean, just because they give you your life back doesn't mean it's really your life back."

Bertus, me, and Tana walk through the underground lab.

The bodies of strangers on the ship were being restored. They could be Allied fallen, people who had died since the Gate, or heroes of the past who were long dead.

"It's a long-winded way of saying it, but that's what it boils down to: you take the bodies of the dead, reanimate them with the arcane arts of Homunculus, attach a fake body to a real one that shouldn't be meshed with the skills of a chimera, and animate it with black magic, and you create a creature with almost as much, if not more, power than the living........ undead."

Bertus looks at me.

"Making it a golem. That's what we're doing."

A living golem, technically.

It contains tricks for many magical disciplines, most of which are forbidden, but at its core it is a living golem.

Golems are made from living humans and reintroduced into the war.

It's also more powerful than when the lion was alive.

"Can you bring a wizard back to life?"

"That's still in the testing phase, but it turns out it's possible."

That's what people in Edina were concerned about, and it's clear that it's possible.

"You don't think it's the priests?"

"......what?"

"I can revive clerics, too, with holy power available, though I don't know why."

At that point, I was at a loss for words at the absurdity of the world.

"Yeah....... I knew the Five Great Houses weren't normal."

Chimeras, homunculi, and black magic.

Eventually, through a combination of alchemy and black magic, the Empire was able to resurrect the corpses of the dead with nearly all of their abilities and use them at will.

"Do you have a self?"

"I don't have it, and I'm glad I don't have it."

A doll that bears an uncanny resemblance to a living human being.

I'm not sure if they should technically be called undead, but they are, after all, undead, and they are like golems.

"Not all of them can be reanimated in this way; some won't regenerate if the defect is too large, and others will regenerate but won't budge when you try to control them."

The success rate is around 7 percent, Bertus added.

In my opinion, it was ridiculously high.

"If I fail to control....... something very bad is going to happen. Am I worrying too much?"

As powerful as Death Knights are, they don't actually restore life abilities. In this case, however, it restores the ability to live.

If you revive a Swordmaster, you get a Swordmaster, and if you revive an Archmage, you get an Archmage.

Just thinking about what would happen if they lost control was enough to make my head hurt.

Bertus smiled bitterly at my question.

"Reinhard, the fate of the world is at stake."

"......."

"How can you not take that risk?"

You'll have to borrow a cat's hand.

If you can borrow a cat's hand, why not the devil's?

Once that devil's hand has gotten me out of trouble, it doesn't matter what happens next.

Bertus' words made sense.

Will these save us.

Or will it take us down another rabbit hole.

"But....... doesn't seem to be ready for live deployment yet, seeing as how it's only incubating things like this."

I don't know what to call them, but with the finished product nowhere to be seen, they're not quite ready to be fielded yet. The moment they come out of the port, the game changes.

"No."

But when I asked, Bertus shook his head.

"It's already in pilot."

"......what?"

"You saw it."

Bertus points his finger upward.

Ground.

"Didn't you think there were too many guards in the temple?"

"......?"

"Weren't there an unusually large number of them, especially around here?"

As it turns out, the security around the College of Witchcraft and Wizardry is very tight.

A large group of guards roamed the neighborhood of the College of Magic.

"If they had that many guards left, they would have sent them to a refugee camp or something. I mean, how many people do you think the Temple has that many guards at the College of Witchcraft and Wizardry?"

In the first place, most of the guards near the College of Magic were homunculus undead.

You may not recognize them, but the guards are all wearing helmets.

So you never see their faces.

No one wants to know what face is inside the helmet in the first place.

"Once we're sure it's taking commands properly, we'll test it by slaying monsters outside the ecliptic."

Suddenly I understood why Ellen and Heinrich hadn't been able to find any monsters near the ecliptic.

A raid to rid the world of monsters in the outer reaches of the ecliptic.

They were resurrected corpses that had nothing to do with the Guard in the first place.

The area around the ecliptic was already a testing ground to see if we could get the resurrection up and running.

The mercenary mission was never meant to be for anyone else, for entirely different reasons.

"After winter, we'll put them all in the field."

The actual deployment was already underway.

It's obvious without looking how much power it will have and how much it will help.

"If they alone can end the gate debacle....... It's funny to say this, but we might not need any more allies."

If an army of returnees is all that is needed to wage war, and if their individual strength is greater than in life, then a larger army may not be necessary.

The gate crisis may end a little sooner, and no more major sacrifices may be made.

If you do something you shouldn't, you can prevent further sacrifices.

The temptation is too great.

I was tempted to just make Death Knight, but Bertus was even more tempted.

It's a choice I have no reason not to make, and I can't help but feel that it was necessary.

However, there is no way to predict the extent of the risk.

What happens when the returnees get out of control.

I don't know.

But it does help.

And if Bertus is right, it doesn't involve the Black Order.

So I've come to the conclusion that no matter how much of a risk this may be to me in the future, I'll just have to wait and see.

Whatever inevitability comes later.

Just as Bertus takes advantage of this, so should you.

But aside from the conclusion, there's another realization.

A body restored to near-original condition.

I think I know what that means.

It's restoring the dead to something close to what they were when they were alive, but it doesn't really bring them back to life.

But it will eventually move like a living thing.

Christina and Adelia suggested it, and it took shape.

I thought this was due to Titan.

They thought they were inspired by Titan and wanted to contribute to the war.

You don't know until you try.

But there's something I would have tried to do.

"Are those guys....... maybe......."

Christina and Anna.

"You didn't try to revive Ashur, did you?"

The first classmate who died.

B-4 Ashur.

I don't know if I started this to bring him back, or if he died while I was doing this and I tried to bring him back afterward.

I would have definitely tried.

"......."

Bertus said nothing.

The silence made me realize that they were trying to revive Ashur.

And, of course, I knew it was bound to fail.

We don't know if the restore succeeded or if it failed.

I didn't have to, and I didn't want to.
