            Episode 497.





There was a time when even the gods had no names; everyone knew there was some kind of power in the world, and everyone believed in something.

The moon-worshippers among them prayed long and hard for immortality.

Therefore, they are blessed by the moonlight, but cannot live without the sunlight.

The gods lend their power as you believe.

Just as believing in a demon lends unholy power.

Since he believed in God in hopes of immortality, it must mean that he was granted immortality.

It's just that we didn't see it coming, and we were cursed by the sun.

"There would be people who were willing to do that, and there would be people who weren't."

"There would be those who would despair that they would never walk under the sun again, and there would be those who would be grateful that they could live forever in the moonlight."

"Monday and all the vampires from Monday were beasts of the night."

"I'm sure that's what some of the Mondays were thinking when they got tired of being immortalized."

"Once again, I want to walk in the sunshine."

"Once again, I want to see the world in the glorious light of the sun."

"It is only natural that a being who lives only in darkness should grow weary of it."

"They said they were trying to beat the sun."

"The clans of Monday sought to overcome the sun with their strength by receiving greater power."

"There were others who thought otherwise."

"By asking the sun for forgiveness, there were those who wished to stand in the sun's light once more."

"Sun-worshipping vampires, they became Sunday."

"Those forgiven by the sun."

"Those who would rather stand in the sun's light with strength than ask for the sun's forgiveness."

"After a very long time, both clans were able to face the sun, albeit in pain."

"That's the vampire that overcame the sun."

"It was a road vampire."

Luna sees me.

They all beat the sun, but in different ways.

Vampires are a part of ancient beliefs and are, in some ways, sacred.

They're just strange beings, blessed by some gods and cursed by others.

"But it's still only half the story, isn't it?"

They are able to face sunlight, but as I have seen, most road vampires, while able to walk in it, feel immense pain.

They just don't like it.

"Time passed, and time passed, and what seemed like eons passed, and the true vampire roots were forgotten, and another line of Lord Vampires were created."

Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

Eventually, Monday erupted into Sunday, and another eruption gave rise to the Road Vampire clan.

I couldn't figure out how long Luna was talking about, but I knew it was a long, long time.

"The oldest of those road vampires, Monday and Sunday, were eventually forced to have an affair."

"The inevitable....... wind?"

"Yeah."

Luna sees me.

"As an immortal, I had everything, but that created a deficit. I sought to fill it."

"Pain in the Sunshine."

"And, the desire for life."

"They wanted to be human again."

"Standing in the sunshine."

"To conceive new life."

"They wanted to take back what they had already given away."

"You said you would devote the rest of your life to the service of the moon and the sun."

"Promising the gods that if they would only give me back my life as a living being, I would devote the rest of my life to worshiping them."

"They wanted a return to humanity."

Immortality, after all, is bound to create a longing for the things it takes away. She places one hand on each of the sculptures of the moon and sun in front of her.

"The vampires of Monday and Sunday, they prayed for a long time to be human again."

"They begged together."

"I begged the moon and the sun, at the same time."

"Mercy to the sun, forgiveness to the moon."

"I prayed for an immeasurably long time."

"I prayed for so long, for so long, that even the gods couldn't turn away."

"Those wretched statues that you give away in the hope of immortality, but in the end, like whining children, cry out to be taken back."

"Because I wanted to turn away, but I couldn't."

Luna looks at me.

"I have forgiven them."

The words seemed to freeze my brain.

It was the one word that turned everything I'd heard her say upside down.

Not forgiven.

I forgave you.

"What....... Now, what....... sound......?"

Luna stares at me.

"The Januaryites are the descendants of Monday and Sunday, vampires turned human. I am the Lord of the Month, their ruler."

Master of the Monthly Party.

Not one of them, but the one who leads them.

Luna Artorius.

She looks at me, places one hand on the moon and one on the sun, and says

"The will of the gods and their messenger, sent down to the world by the gods of the moon and sun."

You are not forgiven.

The one who forgave.

"I am, the incarnation of the moon and the sun."

She was more transcendent than I realized.



* * *



Incarnation of the Gods.

It meant that she was a god, and it meant that she wasn't.

"The Sun Moon Party is the oldest faith group in the world. They are allowed to do nothing but worship the moon and the sun, and I have lived many years as their protector and watcher."

That's what makes Luna so special, even within the party.

It's hard to say how long Luna has been around.

The January Party is a religious organization.

In exchange for their return to humanity, Sunday and Monday vowed to devote their lives to the service of the gods.

Staying out of the affairs of the world was a promise made to the gods.

It was a truth that had been passed down from generation to generation for an immeasurably long time.

And Luna was not a member of the January Party, but rather their protector and watcher.

"Wait....... Then my dad would say......."

"Ronan is human."

At this point, I don't know if I admire Luna or Ronan for marrying an incarnation of the gods.

"I, too, am bound by the roles assigned to me by the gods, and you see why I cannot interfere in the affairs of the world."

It's okay for Luna's children to go out into the world, but not for Luna herself.

Luna herself, as well as Sunday and Monday's descendants, had been paying the price for being human for generations.

"That....... I hate to say this, but my mom tried to kill me."

"If I had succeeded, I would have been destroyed. I would have paid the price for doing something I wasn't allowed to do."

He was risking not only my life, but his own annihilation.

Having lost her son, and now facing the loss of her daughter, Luna was willing to risk her own existence to kill me.

I gave that up, which is probably why Luna still exists.

"It's just a story. Someone who watched humans for so long, he wondered what a truly human life was. He ended up wanting to live it, so he became a human....... That....... It's not a great story."

It watched humans for so long that it eventually became human.

I recall Luna's surprised but somehow pleased expression when I told her that she resembled Ellen not only in appearance but also in personality.

Luna is a god, but she's not a god, she's an oddity.

"That's it. There's nothing more to explain, nothing more you need to know."

"How did you and your father meet?"

"......."

At my words, Luna looks at me with a narrowed brow.

"There's no reason to explain that to you."

Luna snapped, as if to say, "Don't you dare.

It's time to go home.

I have to get back to what I have to face.

What happened on the outside.

I wonder if something irreversible has happened.

Luna walks toward me, still.

Now to get me back.

"Ragan was boisterous and Ellen was calm, but they were both good listeners."

She stands in front of me and talks about her children.

"How lucky I am that I'm not one of those backward, arrogant, herd mentality kids like you. I've often thought that about you."

"Well, I think I'm a good listener."

"Yeah, how lucky I was that they weren't the ones telling me things I didn't need to hear......."

Luna smiled and put her hand on my shoulder.

"But....... I guess it wouldn't have been so bad to have a son like you after all."

"You're still corrected, have another one."

"Come on!"

-Bam!

"Eek!"

In the end, I was forced to take a hit.

I wonder how many times I've been hit in the stomach and how many times I've been hit in the back.

I can't possibly be the only one experiencing what I'm experiencing.

I had a weird experience at Lizaira.

Not because it was a village controlled by an incarnation of the gods, but because it was the first time I had ever lived in such a naturalistic environment.

Luna sighed heavily as she watched me hawk for one more word.

"Close your eyes."

Is it really time to go?

It asked me to close my eyes for a moment, so I did, and I was in Lizaira.

Now that I've told you to close your eyes, I'll open them again and you'll be able to leave Rizaira.

"Mother."

"Why."

"Thank you."

"......."

That's what I really meant.

It was only then that I realized she hadn't taught me anything.

If I put myself in a monthly party, I'm bound by the rules of the monthly party.

If I had unlearned the vision of the January Party, it would have been a terrible disaster for me.

I realize now that he didn't teach me anything because he was doing it for me.

Luna is silent for a moment at my greeting.

And.

"Reinhardt."

"Yes."

She says goodbye.

"To you."

She whispers quietly.

"The sun and the moon will favor you."

Something similar to what Arta said to me.

Something a little different, though.

She didn't open her eyes or say another word.

The weight of the hand that had been resting on my shoulder was gone, and the air shifted.

-Heeeeeeeee!

"This is......."

Fierce winds whipping through the mountains.

I was back at the top of a certain mountain long ago when I met Luna.

The time is night.

"......What is it?"

I felt a strange sense of dysphoria.

The season is winter.

So in a windy place like this, you'd have to feel a fierce, skin-tearing cold.

However, while the wind was blowing hard, it didn't feel like it was killing me.

Also, there was no white stuff everywhere.

And crucially.

"What's......?"

The corpses of dead monsters lay nearby.

It was a long time ago, but I certainly haven't forgotten it.

In my search for Rizaira across the Sren Mountains, I had to fight many monsters.

One day, I was tired of fighting monsters in this place and called Luna.

And as if answering a call, Luna came to me, and I was able to enter Rizaira.

But the exact same view as the moment I was on my way to Rizaira.

The corpses of bleeding monsters.

There's only one thing we can deduce from that.

Time.

It was barely flowing.

"Trust me.

It was only now that I realized what that really meant.
