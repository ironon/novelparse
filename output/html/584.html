            Episode 584.





Heinrich looked determined, and Louise was stunned.

And rightly so. The Devil, the cause of all this, the one who deserves the hatred of all the world, has secretly visited his son.

And he hasn't told anyone about it, let alone himself, until now.

Heinrich explained.

Before she found out she was illegitimate, when she was struggling with her siblings' hatred and not knowing the truth, she received a letter from someone she didn't recognize.

"It was a....... that my brothers were going to kill me."

"!"

"Maybe....... I think they knew I was illegitimate, I don't know how they knew it, but......."

Naturally, Heinrich thought the letter was a prank, and he didn't believe it. But from the mouths of his brothers, who were actually uncles, Heinrich received confirmation that he was illegitimate.

"He came to me that day, so I guess he's been watching from somewhere."

"The Devil came to....... himself......?"

"Yes, he definitely showed up in person."

The demon suggested to Heinrich.

If you want to live like this, follow yourself.

Because if you stay here, you're either going to get killed, or you're going to want to kill your brothers.

"And....... I said if you follow me, I'll tell you everything. What's happened so far. What's going to happen next. What I can do from there......."

The more Louise listened, the more the hairs on her body stood on end.

Unbeknownst to him, the Demon King was digging up information on the Allies, and his own son was being watched.

I wonder if this is what it feels like to have your blood run dry.

But it was a good thing.

Her son hasn't followed the devil, he's here now, in front of her.

"The devil tried to trick you."

"......."

"Thank goodness, thank goodness, you didn't follow the devil. You made a good choice. You were wise."

The three tongues of the devil were tricked into following him.

Herriot de Saint-Ouen.

Liana De Granz.

Olivia Ranze.

It may only be three, but all three were either the children of prominent nobles or considered the future of the empire.

I don't know where they are or what they're doing, but it was already a shocking event in itself.

Taking advantage of Heinrich's panic and confusion, the devil tried to take his son.

Heinrich made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

Louise was overjoyed and thrilled that her son had rejected the devil's offer.

Since you can't say no or refuse, you've turned down the devil's offer.

How sophisticated and terrifying such a demon is.

"Sister, I didn't follow the devil because I don't believe in him."

Heinrich looks at Louise with a stony expression.

"What......?"

I didn't follow the devil.

But Louise's hands began to tremble as she watched her son say the words she was afraid to utter: that he believed in the devil.

"I know what you're thinking. Maybe the devil lied to me to get me to do this, or maybe I'm telling you these things because I'm caught up in the lie."

Heinrich says, swallowing hard.

"I have no intention of following the Devil, and I have no intention of cooperating with him, even if he comes back. You can rest assured of that, but no matter how much I try to doubt....... No matter how much I try to doubt....... I am the Devil....... Reinhardt is an evil being."

"Youngest, the Devil has deceived everyone. Didn't he deceive everyone by wearing a mask of gentleness and kindness, and didn't you see those closest to him who followed him and helped him?"

Heinrich couldn't help but freeze up at that statement.

Kindness and gentleness.

That's not something anyone who's ever been near a demon in his temple days can say.

"......nun. The Devil was far from kind and gentle. He was technically a madman."

"That....... is."

"Yeah, he was a crazy guy who got into all kinds of trouble. He was doing everything he wasn't supposed to do on the topic he was infiltrating."

If the goal is to infiltrate and capture, the Demon has done too many things he shouldn't have done.

But Reinhardt had gotten to know and befriended many people. But it was more of a coincidence, a series of coincidences, than a scheme of the devil.

If the goal was indeed subsumption, the demon would have no reason to behave that way.

It's too consequentialist to say that because the outcome is what it is, the purpose of the process must have been.

The devil lived in the temple like a madman. In fact, Heinrich is technically a victim.

But Louise is only frightened to hear her son talking about the devil.

I was afraid that I had already fallen for the devil's trick-or-treating.

"Sister, don't you think that at some point the Allies seem to be marching too easily?"

But Heinrich knew what to say to his sister.

"......No way."

"The weather is too good for winter, the warp gates of smaller cities have already been taken over without any operations, and even this battle in Serandia looks like someone has already swept through it."

Clearly a strange situation.

Things that no one seems to care about.

"You can't tell me that....... That's......."

"It is certain that the forces of the Devil are aiding our advance, fighting ahead of us."

A secret or strategy the empire is hiding.

I had vaguely wondered if that was the case.

But to say that it was all the help of the devil was something I didn't want to believe, regardless of the possibility.

"The devil is....... Why on earth would he do that, after causing the Gate debacle. Why the hell is he helping us?"

"I don't understand why the Demon is helping us. Why the Empire is keeping this a secret. I don't know what the Demon really wants, but....... I do know one thing."

The Devil caused the Gate Crisis to destroy humanity.

"There's something we don't know about the gate situation in the first place."

Heinrich is the one who no longer believes in that proposition.

Ludwig was on his way to the Temple of Tuan.

It's a small comfort to Ludwig to know that he can do something, but he's not the only one who feels stuck in the snow.

Ludwig was told by Lowen that the collapse of the shack was worse than the cold from the snow.

Ludwig could see people on roofs clearing snow, as well as people clearing snow from the streets.

While the guards and the imperial family were hard at work clearing the snow, the citizens were just as eager to get rid of it.

That's why the streets of the ecliptic, which have been chilly since the Gate incident, were full of people for the first time in a long time.

But there were many people in the refugee camps who didn't have the energy to do this.

It's important to clean up, but what's the point in this situation? It's a shack with no protection from the cold wind, but without it, people are shivering to death in the freezing cold.

The land is now filled with such anguish everywhere.

Both Rowen and Ludwig know that cleaning up the disease is just the tip of the iceberg.

What Rowen is doing now has nothing to do with hope. It's a temporary fix for despair, it's not about saving the world, it's not about bringing peace.

But it's something we have to do because we can't afford not to.

In a time when even the slightest hint of hope has become a luxury, it's all we can do to patch the holes in the dam of despair.

Furthermore, Rowen is an archbishop, not just a priest, and Ludwig is a superhuman, albeit with a missing arm.

The reality is that even they can only do small things. So there is no place for the smaller ones.

Big things happen to big people.

The big ones, like Ellen, Heinrich, and Louise von Schwarz, who joined us for breakfast today.

Those who are very powerful individually, or can mobilize large armies, will end the gate.

It is their role to find hope.

When it's all said and done, when we can say peace in small ways, even the smallest things will find meaning.

A moment when those who somehow survived are faced with the task of peace and reconstruction. What Ludwig and Rowen are doing now means that they have saved countless lives and given them a future.

That's why Ludwig walks.

With the hope that one day it will all work out.

Rather than despair and give up, realize that there is still something you can do and do it.

Ludwig still refuses to give up.

While walking along.

Nearing the temple where Rowen resides.

-Where do I sell this?

-Wouldn't some of the nobles want to buy it?

Ludwig could see people running through the streets with sacks.

There were a lot of them.

A group of people, some of whom seemed to be in a group, some of whom didn't, were running in circles.

-Damn, I wish I'd eaten it instead.

-We've already been robbed, where's the good stuff?

-But I don't see any gold or silver in that temple.

-I would have sold it a long time ago. How did you get this much out of that poor man's shrine?

-Oh well, at least you only burned a little hair.

-We're better off. Anyone who goes in now is fucked.

Ludwig could see smoke rising from the sky beyond the alley.

-Fire!

"......!"

Before he could even comprehend the words, Ludwig was running.



* * *



Through the pouring snow, Ludwig could see the grayish-white smoke that had engulfed the entire temple, billowing flames that seemed to defy the sky.

-currr

Thousands of people crowded around it, staring blankly at the enormous shape of the fire.

The Temple of Tuan, where Rowen is staying, is engulfed in flames.

-No!

I could hear the sound of something breaking and crumbling.

-I think it's falling apart.......

-What about the guards?

-See if you can turn that off.......

-Heaven's punishment for those who conspire with the devil.

-Yes, man, what those refugee camp bums have done deserves a thousand punishments!

Ludwig couldn't help but notice the people he had just passed.

Looting.

"Sometimes, some people try to start fires.

And fireproofing.

Someone has set fire to the temple and is taking advantage of the opportunity to loot its contents.

"Rowen!"

Ludwig leaped into the shrine as if possessed.

As the temple burned, they watched in amusement as Ludwig leapt into the flames.

But Ludwig didn't care what the onlookers thought, or what they had to say about the Tuan Order.

"Ugh!"

-currrr

Inside the smoke-filled temple, it was chaos. Anything that could burn was burning, and it was hard to tell what was going on.

-with

It was on the verge of collapse, and the sounds of breaking wood and cracking walls began to get louder and louder.

Who. Why.

No matter how much I hate the Tuan Order, do I have to do this?

Ludwig was soon visible through the acrid smoke.

'No way......?

Inside the temple, people Ludwig didn't recognize, but who wore the robes of priests, were lying all over the chapel.

He didn't have time to look closely, but Ludwig couldn't help but intuit that they were all dead.

-Bang!

He lifts a collapsed pillar that is burning, he lifts a collapsed stone pillar, he looks for something.

I hold my breath, knowing that inhaling smoke is dangerous even for a superhuman.

Find.

Who should be here.

How many times have I wandered through the smoke of a burning chapel.

Soon, Ludwig could see someone crouching in front of the statue of Tuan.

"!!!"

Archbishop Rowen.

Rowen was there, not in his usual gray, faded robes, but in white holy robes.

But what should have been a white robe was stained red.

"Rowen......!"

Rowen's entire body could only be described as exhausted.

After being stabbed and mauled so many times, the white shirt might as well be called a red shirt.

Ludwig knelt before Rowen's dead body, trembling and wide-eyed.

"Priest, priest, wake up!"

But even as he spoke, Ludwig knew that his calling could not bring Rowen back.

Even in death, Rowen remained wide-eyed, forever robbed of something he could never get back.

Clutching Rowen's shoulder, Ludwig blinked back tears that could not be contained, even in the heat of the flames that threatened to burn his entire body.

"This is....... What the hell. why. This is....... Why....... Why?"

-Support

The temple continued to burn.

-Top!

And with the sound of something breaking that shouldn't break.

-Currrrr!

The temple has fallen.
