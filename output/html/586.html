"Ugh."

-Cat!

I don't know what's up with this kid lately.

He keeps opening his mouth wide and pretending to eat my face.

You don't realize that's a fucking scary thing from a cat's perspective, do you?

Weird or not, this is just plain scary!

I'm glad they didn't do something pointless like patrol the ecliptic.

It's kind of scary because he's like a kid with nothing in his brain except for playing with his cat all day.

Ellen murmurs as she flops down on the bed, leaving me at her bedside.

Luckily, Ellen doesn't seem to be as dazed these days, which is nice.

I'm glad to hear that animal therapy seems to be working so well for you.

"Cute."

Well.

That's not easy for you either.

Of course, Ellen's expression darkened as she looked out the window where the snow was still falling.

It's coming, like hell.

There's nothing Ellen can do as she watches the snow cover everything in sight. Because snow is not a monster.

There's nothing a warrior can do in a snowstorm.

So all I can do is rest.

Ellen lingered like that for a while, then pulled me into a hug and got up.

Well.

Is it lunchtime already?

So much for time melting away.



* * *



Lunch break.

Heinrich and Louise had returned from their walk just in time to be seated in the banquet room.

However, the atmosphere was a little different than usual.

Not the atmosphere of the two, but the atmosphere of the ballroom.

-Please make a list of students who would like to volunteer to help with the snow removal and report to your supervisor.

Users were making announcements to people entering the ballroom.

The entire ecliptic is probably inundated with snow removal needs right now.

It's not a mandate, but it's an empowering responsibility, a mission.

So we were swamped with students getting their names on the list.

It's a scene of superhumans shrouded in a blue flame of empowerment clearing the streets of the zodiac with shovels, not spears and swords.......

Of course, there are superhumans, magic majors, and psychics. I think they could be of some use in clearing the zodiacal snow.

No, wait.

Instead of eating, Ellen's eyes were darting toward the crowd of snowplow volunteers.

I know you can do .......

You're a snow shoveler.

"Uh, Ellen."

Ellen brought food nearby and sat down, and Heinrich recognized her. Beside him, Louise von Schwarz was slicing sausages.

"Are you going to shovel the snow?"

"Because there's nothing to do."

It's not dangerous, but.......

You know how you learn to hate snow when you clean it?

No, I don't think I hate it enough already.

"If you want to, you can. And don't forget to check out ....... It's not like it wouldn't be helpful, and if you think about it, there might be a way."

"Oh....... Yes, sister."

Louise didn't seem to be trying to force Heinrich's hand, but she seemed to be halfway there.

Snow is probably the most pressing issue in the ecliptic right now.

If things get too serious, consider reaching out to Riana.

But there's something we can do rather than just rest, and it's helping people, and it's not dangerous. So there was a little bit of excitement in the normally quiet atmosphere.

Many are aristocrats, picked and chosen by the empire.

They fought for humanity in the face of the Gate crisis.

No matter where you come from or how you were raised, the idea that you have to use your power for the good of others is ingrained in you from your experiences.

So I'm from a noble background, and I'm Nabal, and the snow is killing people, so of course I'm thinking I need to move.

In that idea that people are great, but ultimately sad.

Suddenly.

Somewhere.

Something burnt....... something like that.

I smell burnt.

What is it?

Looking around, I couldn't help but find the epicenter of the smell.

Ludwig.

"Ludwig......?"

Heinrich narrowed his eyes at Ludwig.

Not only did it smell burnt, but it was a mess.

"Hey guys......."

Ludwig slowly approaches Ellen and Heinrich.

"I need to......."

"Dude, what's wrong with you. What happened?"

Heinrich stood up from his seat, and the others stared at Ludwig in disbelief.

"I need to....... Just once......."

Ludwig mumbles to himself.

"Can you help me with......?"

He was completely transfixed, and it was clear that something had happened to him.



* * *



When it was clear that Ludwig had been through a rough patch, Heinrich, Ellen, and Louise finished their meal.

Exit the ballroom and enter the lobby of the Class B dormitory.

"I think you need to get cleaned up. Are you hurt?"

"Yes, I'm not hurt...... I'm not hurt....... Yes....... I'm not hurt......."

Louise grabbed Ludwig's shoulder as he repeated the same words as if they were broken.

"Go wash up, clear your head, get dressed, get your thoughts together, and then we'll talk. Okay?"

"Aye, sir....... Yes, Commander......."

Ludwig nodded slowly, frozen by Louise's words.

We all watched in stunned silence as Ludwig staggered back to his room.

"What the....... What the hell happened to her?"

"......I don't know."

"I think I was at the fire, but......."

Ellen was hugging me and looking worriedly in the direction of Ludwig's room.



* * *



Ludwig was soon washed and dressed and out into the lobby.

It still didn't seem to calm down.

Ludwig explained the situation, rambling on about how fascinated he was. He wasn't a very talkative person to begin with, but now that something had happened, he was even more so.

"Looting?"

"Uh....... The people....... set fire to the temple where that priest was and....... looted it and....... and killed all the people in the temple......."

Ellen, Louise, and Heinrich couldn't help but roll their eyes.

"By the time I got there, it was too late. All the people were dead. The temple was burning. I went in to find the priest, but he was already....... murdered in a horrible...... way and....... The building had just collapsed on itself......."

Ludwig is crushed by the collapsing building, but superhumans don't die that way.

Ludwig was lying with Rowen's body in the crumbling temple when he escaped on his own.

He watched as the guards and mages arrived to put out the fire.

The arriving guards examined Ludwig and, after realizing he was not an official, let him go.

Maybe it's because I jumped into the fire that it smelled so bad.

In the end, Ludwig was forced to return to the temple, unable to do anything.

"If you do this....... It's not supposed to be like this, you know, what did the priest do wrong, it's not the priest who did wrong, it's the people in the temple who did wrong. They're looking at the fire and they're saying it's a good thing, and they're saying it's a good thing he's dead, and it's not supposed to be like that."

There was anger in Ludwig's eyes.

"I'm....... I don't know, maybe this shouldn't be happening, all I can think about is that, and......."

Ludwig looks at Ellen and Heinrich and says.

"I get that the people who did this need to be punished, but I have no idea how to find them....... I have no idea."

Ludwig mumbles to himself.

"I saw people running away after looting the temple. I want to find them. I want to find them and ask them why they did that. Why did they have to do that....... I want to ask him, he was a good man, he was trying to save people, he was a good man, why did you kill him......."

Ludwig has even seen the criminals himself. But he doesn't have the power to investigate, and even if he did, he doesn't think he'd be able to catch them.

"I'm sorry, I don't think I'm qualified to ask you to do this, but....... It's not something I can do, so I'm going to......."

Ludwig's face and eyes were filled with sorrow, frustration, and anger.

Ludwig has no power, no strength. And he doesn't think he can solve it.

That's why I came back to Temple for help.

Someone with power, strength, and even wisdom who might be able to help him.

There is only one person who can come to Ludwig's mind.

"Just once....... Can you help me just once......?"

Of course, it could only be Ellen Artorius.

Ellen looked at Ludwig, who looked desperate, and nodded as if it was a given.

"Yes. Let me help you."

Feeling guilty for Ludwig, Ellen, of course, couldn't refuse the favor.



* * *



The arson, murder, and looting of Tuan's temple.

Ludwig asked Ellen for help, and she said she would help without a second thought.

Louise and Heinrich didn't respond immediately, but they listened intently to Ludwig's words.

Ludwig described what he saw as he saw it.

"The priest said that there were people defacing the temple, and there were people trying to set it on fire. Maybe....... Maybe the people who were doing those things were working together to do those things....... I think so."

Hatred of the Tuan and Als faiths sometimes leads to attacks on their temples.

People graffiti, deface temples, and even try to set them on fire.

And that arson attempt led to the real thing.

"Are you sure everyone in the temple is dead?"

Ludwig nodded at Ellen's words.

"When I entered the temple....... I didn't see anyone alive."

Once she agreed to help, Ellen's face remained calm and unmoved.

"And that it was done by 'normal' people."

"I saw people walking back from looting the temple, apparently....... I think they said something about food being better than this stuff. No, I don't think I heard it, I heard it, I'm sure."

After listening to Ludwig's words, Ellen considers for a moment, then looks at Ludwig and says calmly, "I'm sorry.

"There are many priests who aren't very physically capable per se, but is it possible for an archbishop-level priest....... be killed by civilians?"

Yes.

That's the problem.

Is it possible that an attack by vengeful men could kill an archbishop and everyone in the temple?

I was thinking the same thing as Ellen.

But Ellen's words made Ludwig shake his head.

"I thought about that, too, but if Father Rowen was a man who could fight, he wouldn't have used me as his bodyguard in the first place, and if something happened during the cleanup....... I'd take the priest and run."

Ludwig has a point.

If Archbishop Lowen was capable of fighting for himself, there was no reason for Ludwig to be his bodyguard. There's no reason why someone who can defend themselves shouldn't.

"And the temple wasn't that big, either. Maybe....... I don't think there were any paladins, and none of the bodies were wearing armor......."

There is a severe shortage of priests, and most of the combat-ready troops are in Allied camps. And it's not the headquarters of the Crusader Knights, but the individual shrines of the Five Great Lords on the Ecliptic, and they're small.

It makes sense that there wasn't a single paladin.

The ramshackle temple could have been attacked by a mob, and it's not impossible that everyone was killed.

A mob entered the temple, killing priests and worshippers and setting the temple on fire.

It's not impossible for it to happen. It's just less likely. The persecution of the Tuan and Alth faiths is a reality of the ecliptic.

Ludwig found it unbearable to see people's anger directed at innocent people in such a way.

"Like you said, if it was a mob, the Guard and the Crusaders won't be able to catch them all, and that includes me."

Just because she's Ellen doesn't mean she can do anything.

"I guess so......."

Ludwig sought out Ellen, thinking that there might be another way, that someone other than him, someone with more brains than him, might be better than him.

But just because it's Ellen doesn't mean you'll find anything there if it's a mob raid and looting of the temple.

Ellen remained silent and thoughtful, as if to say that if what you said was true, it was most likely something I would never know.

At this point, Louise von Schwarz stares at Ludwig.

It was clear that Louise had a huge crush on Ludwig because of his good heart. And yesterday, she'd even gotten some help herself.

So, it was clear that Ludwig wanted to do something to help him in his time of need.

"I don't know the details, but there are some issues that need to be clarified."

"Which......?"

"That we need to think about this case in three distinct phases."

Louise holds up a finger.

"Murder."

"Arson."

"And looting."

"This case has three distinct phases."

"So it's all about the order."

"Killing first, arson first, looting first. You have to be clear about what the objective of the raiders was in the first place."

Louise compartmentalizes the case.

"It's possible that the goal was plunder. If they raided the temple to do so, they would have been discovered and killed by the priests during the raid. If so, they would have stolen before the raid. When they were caught, they killed the priests, and then set the temple on fire. Why they would set fire to them, I don't know."

Louise says slowly.

"It could have been murder. If so, they would have stormed the temple, killed the priests, and looted the empty temple. The temple's contents may have been too valuable to leave behind. Setting it on fire may have been an act of anger."

Heinrich was listening to Louise's words.

"It is very unlikely that arson was the purpose. But Ludwig, you say that the priests were all dead when you entered the temple, so the arson must have come after the murder."

A story about the sequence and purpose of events.

Fireproofing is first priority.

Looting or murder would have been the goal, not arson. The words froze Ludwig in his tracks.

"Is the order....... Why does it matter......?"

"It's important."

Louise says.

"Because the murderers, looters, and arsonists might be other people."

Louise looks at Ellen.

He looks at me like I don't understand what he means.

"You're saying that three different things could have happened at different times, and by different people."

"Yeah."

What seems like a single event may actually be a series of events at the hands of different people, Ruiz said.

"Even if it was a mob in the first place, the people who killed the priests, the people who stole the stuff, and the people who set the fires would be different, and the timing of those things would be different."

"And."

"Ludwig, as you say, the temple is poorly guarded. I think you're right."

"No matter how many mobs there are....... No matter how incapable of combat the priest is."

"The likelihood of a priest the size of an archbishop being killed at the hands of a mob seems....... seems very low."

Neither Louise nor Ellen seemed to recognize that this was anything out of the ordinary.

At the end of the day, sitting down and talking doesn't change anything.

"Let's go to the field."

Ellen says

The crucial difference between Ludwig and Ellen.

In the land of men, there is no door that does not open at the name of Ellen Artorius.

It's not the Guard, it's not the Crusaders.

"Me....... sister."

Heinrich looks at Louise cautiously.

Louise looks at Heinrich with her usual stony expression. This is the man who, in all honesty, seems to be as cold as they come, but who, after all, killed two of his brothers with his own hands for Heinrich's sake.

I can't tell you how much I hate Heinrich and how much guilt I feel for him.

"You're helping a friend, who am I to tell you what to do, and I've had a hand in it."

Heinrich and Louise have come to rest.

I'm not here to be political.

"Of course, if you think it's dangerous, you should stop."

Louise says and looks at Ludwig.

"So I'll follow you."

Whether she helps or not, she seems to want everyone to back off if she thinks it's dangerous. There's no reason for her to stand by and watch Heinrich do something dangerous.

"Go, thank you......."

Ludwig was ecstatic when Ellen stepped up to help the unexpected.

This is something.

Things just keep getting bigger.

Somehow this job. I don't think it's going to end well.

So you have a bunch of people in this room who are suddenly up to no good.

I have a feeling this isn't going to end well.

I wanted to say something, but I'm a cat, after all, and I couldn't say anything except meow.
