The day after the council.

After the meeting broke up.

Elise and I stood side by side in a deserted hallway, the wind howling outside.

I leaned back in the hallway, Elise staring straight ahead with a determined expression on her face.

"Is this....... correct?"

"Let's hope so."

"Degradation. I've lived a long time, and I've never even heard of an artifact named Akasha, and I'm....... I'm afraid it exists, if it does, and if it doesn't, I'm afraid I don't know what Antrian is up to."

Elise's fears were understandable.

I'm scared, too.

I was nervous that something worse could happen than what happened with Gate.

Wouldn't it be better to do nothing and face a scheduled gate event?

When you start getting involved with a mysterious ancient artifact called Akasha, things can get really out of hand.

The future is unknown.

Of course, I've never been so afraid of anything in my life.

"......I made a mistake."

When I didn't speak, Elise squeezed my hand.

A chill ran down my spine.

"I'm sure you're more afraid of him than anyone else, but I'm afraid of him......."

"......."

I wonder if he's conveyed the fear I'm feeling right now without saying it.

Eleris seemed to be convinced by my demeanor that I wasn't plotting to end the world.

Not everything will work out, but you have to believe in it.

If you're not going to do anything, you shouldn't have started anything.

"Everything will be fine."

I spoke with the power of the spirit, but my voice echoing down the hallway was hollow.



* * *



After the meeting reconvened, I asked Antony a few more questions.

How the first contact with Cantus Magna was made.

In the end, it wasn't so different from my idea. Antirrhinus dabbled in black magic and sobriety to find the secret of immortality.

"The whole point was to call in the sobriety hunters, but if you get immortality in the process, that's not a bad thing."

I'm not aware of anybody who's ever done anything outrageous in the name of immortality.

So it was quite a strange feeling to see Antirrhinus.

For example, it was like watching a villain who dreamed of immortality, which is common in the early and middle episodes, not the later ones, fulfill his dream without being cut down by the hero.

I don't know the extent of the misdeeds committed by the Lord Vampires here, but Antirrhinus was a truly evil warlock.

It's like a few hundred years after Qin Shi Huang's immortalized dream.

That asshole is.......

Is it okay to leave it as it is.......

"So the booze hunters came, and I asked to be one of them, and I could be one of them in exchange for all the booze I had."

"Does Cantus Magna readily accept new members?"

"No, they only took me in because I had so much sobriety, and they'd have to bleed to take it away from me, and they were probably going to purge me sooner or later."

Antirrhinus didn't give Cantus Magna the lame excuse that he had betrayed him because he was going to be purged anyway.

Apparently, Antirrhinus doesn't care about rationalization.

Antirrhinus and Cantus Magna briefly collaborated on each other's needs, and technically Antirrhinus was the loser, as he paid for the wine and never got to see the Akasha.

Of course, this was the price Cantus Magna paid for failing to get rid of Antirrhinus, so they each lost out by exposing their secret agenda to the outside world.

"By the way, I'm telling you that with your own vision and sobriety, contacting Cantus Magna is a surprisingly easy matter."

The Vampire Council is not much different than a secret society. The Black Order knew of the existence of the Lord Vampire, but not necessarily of the five vampire families.

After all, the sobriety or magic that only they possess is not yet available to Cantus Magna.

In other words, if Cantus Magna learns of the Council's existence, or if the Lord Vampires make their presence known, contact itself is easy. In the form of them coming to you.

"That sounds like something I need to think about carefully."

Galarsh said, and I agreed.

"I don't like it."

Lerouen snapped, not wanting to take that level of risk.

Honestly, I agreed with that.

"I don't think it's wise to expose us."

"What would you do then?"

At Antony's question, I crossed my arms.

"Last time I had contact with the Black Order, I killed one of their members."

Everyone but Eleris was stunned by the news.

"It was tangential at best. It wasn't a big deal. The important thing was that I told them I could give them information about Cantus Magna."

It's likely that the Black Order doesn't know about Akasha.

It's not like the Black Order doesn't know how to contact Cantus Magna. However, they're at odds with each other, so they'll want to get to know each other beforehand rather than engage in an all-out war. They just need the information because they want to fight from an optimal vantage point, whether it's a surprise or not.

There's a reason the Black Order didn't take the risk and go head-to-head with Cantus Magna.

Can we use this information to turn the Black Order and Cantus Magna against each other?

And, is it really the right thing to do?

"It's not too late to try and negotiate with the Black Order, see what kind of attitude they come out with, and then make a decision, because it's not worth the risk."

They all nodded at my words.

If the Black Order gets it right, Cantus Magna may be irrelevant, though it's clear that there's a nasty little thing called Akasha.

Still, they succeeded in preparing information about Cantus Magna before the Black Order contacted them.

We've gained the cooperation of the Vampire Council, and we have information about Cantus Magna.

There's nothing left for the council to do until the Black Order case is resolved.

"For now, that's all I need."

We don't need their power yet.

Hopefully it won't come to that.



* * *



I thought it might be quite long, but the Vampire Council only took two days.

I'm curious about Antony's intentions, but it's hard to tell since the important information and mood shift came from his side.

You don't know if it's an enemy or an ally, but it helps for now.

That's what alliances are for. Revolutionary forces will try to ally with us, knowing that they'll be pointing knives at each other later.

The council has concluded and tomorrow we return to the ecliptic.

With nothing better to do, I wandered around Epiax. The snow had stopped falling, and the sharp wind had died down.

Even though it is under the care of humans, Epiax is not frequented by humans.

So the castle would be empty most of the year. I wandered into a room.

Pantheon.

I saw a statue of Eleris here and knew it had something to do with vampires.

As I gazed up at the seven gargoyles, I suddenly felt uncomfortable.

If this was a gargoyle of Gazoo, then it was a gargoyle of Elves and Orcs. So there had to be statues of Galarsh and Leruen.

But none of them had long ears or looked like an orc.

Sure enough, the statues of Lucinian and Antirrhinus were there.

"I've changed it since it's been in the human eye."

I turned at the sound of a voice behind me, and there was Lerouen.

"We've decided not to tell the humans what this place is like, because even if we did, they might say it's unclean if there are any suspicious orc or elf statues."

In reality, the statue in Moyo's location did not have long ears, but it did resemble Lerouen.

Of course, the statue of Friday, where Galarsh was supposed to be, had the appearance of a normal person.

Lerouen stood in the center of the pantheon, facing a certain direction.

"From what I hear, I'm the oldest of all road vampires."

"Listen to ......?"

Sensing my doubt, Lerouen smiled wryly.

"I'm erasing my memory in 200-year increments."

"Ah."

I guess that's one way to endure eternal life.

If so, then Leruen, the oldest being, would have the least memory of the past.

Lerouen had chosen to erase his memory, not die.

"You forgot because I wanted you to, but you did it because you had to......."

Lerouen stands in the center of the Pantheon, arms crossed, looking in any direction.

"I can't help but wonder what the hell I knew before I wiped my memory like this."

There was something wistful in his eyes.

"For what reason did the elves become extinct?"

"What the hell happened to Sunday and Monday. What were they in the first place."

"Surely, I should have known all along."

"Why did I have to erase those memories."

"No, I wonder if I erased that memory."

Lerouen looks at me.

I read more of a desire than a curiosity.

He'd erased his memories, but he couldn't figure out why he'd had to do it, and Lerouen seemed to crave the missing memories.

I was wondering why I had to delete it.

Lerouen stood still, watching Sunday, Monday, and his gargoyle.

Unlike Antony, the Lord Vampires were complex beings, both good and evil.

"Is there such a thing as wind in the Thurday gazoo?"

"You mean like Lucinil?"

Like Lucien, who wanted to have a soul, does Leroy have one?

"Well, technically....... It's about getting your true memories back. All the memories you've forgotten."

Lerouen said, and then shook his head.

"But if I had to find them all, I'd definitely go crazy."

You want your memories back, but you're not sure you can handle them.

"Yeah, well, I don't really have any desires, but I don't want to die, so I'm just going to keep on going, and I'm going to keep on delaying death, and I'm going to keep on living with only the most important memories, like the fact that I'm a lord vampire, and that I have a clan."

Time has been ticking away, with all the memories of magic, power, and lore blotted out, except for the ones that are useless.

"Live......."

As if compressing himself. Lerouen seems to mull over his last words, then shakes his head. I wonder if he thinks the word "living" is inappropriate for the undead.

"I think it's more like dying a very slow death."

Slowly dying, with death postponed indefinitely into the future.

When their immortality becomes unbearable, they choose death.

So you're not living, you're just slowly dying, Lerouen says.

I wonder how that's different from living, after all.

Living and slowly dying.

The end result is the same thing, but the nuances are wickedly different.

"When everything you've planned is done and you've truly rebuilt Darklands, what will you do?"

Lerouen looks at me with that question.

There is a deep sense of emptiness in this ancient being. It is aware that it is living, but that it is doing so for no reason.

And then the next, and the next, and the next.

Is that what you're asking?

Unfortunately, I have no intention of becoming a true demon. So such questions are pointless.

Because I hadn't thought about it.

"I'll do something."

"......?"

"You're right, they're going to do something, they're not going to do nothing."

But if it does, I'm not going to do anything about it, so that's all I can say.

Lerouen chuckled at my comment.

"Haha....... Haha! Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do something....... something."

Lerouen's ears perked up as he realized what was so funny about my comment.

"Good, maybe that's a better way to think about it."

I don't know how my cursory answer resonated with Lerouen.

However, Lerouen said it had been a long time since he'd laughed like that, and then quietly walked down the hall and disappeared.

Nothingness does not belong to those who have given up thinking.

You've overthought it and overthought it and overthought it.

As if she would even realize such a thing. Lerouen's steps seemed quite light.



* * *



The next day.

The other road vampires had no use for us right now, but they agreed to cooperate.

While Akasha is a great source of power in her own right, she said she would investigate how to open the portal to the otherworld I mentioned.

"This is something I've never thought about before. I'm intrigued."

Antirrhinus said.

Regardless of whether or not it's possible to collaborate with the otherworld to bring down an empire, the theme of exploring the existence of the otherworld seemed to appeal to me.

Great minds with nothing but time on their hands. Plus, he's a wizard, so I was just intrigued.

"The council will reconvene if the Demon King needs our help."

Lerouen said.

Normally, the council rarely convenes unless something extraordinary happens. However, since the Vampire Council chose to link up with me, it seemed like they were fulfilling their alliance responsibilities.

I don't really have anything to offer, and everyone cooperates with me for their own reasons.

One by one, I watched as they began to teleport out of Epiax.

Eleris has left the ecliptic for now. She is unlikely to return to the ecliptic until she has a new hiding place or camouflage.

So for the time being, I'll be staying on the council as a liaison.

I'm sure we'll always be able to see each other via teleportation, but the distance is just too great.

That's a bit of a bummer.

Still, it was nice to be within easy reach.

In the great hall of Castle Epiax. Eleris inclined her head toward me.

"Take a look, degradation."

"?"

What is this?

"I need a ride. You want me to go alone?"

"Ah."

Eleris shook her head when I said that.

"Looks like Lucinil hasn't told you yet."

I wondered what this was all about, and before I knew it, Lucinil was standing next to me.

"Archdemon, you're coming with me."

"...... Why?"

"I'll be staying here for a while, so if you need magic, Lucinil will help you."

a.

Something like that.

Lucinil has no clan and is alone, so she has more freedom than other Lord Vampires.

Between Radia's care and her duties as the Council's liaison, Eleris has decided to stay for the time being.

So I'm unable to get support from Eleris for the time being.

This meant that from now on, if I needed to go somewhere via teleportation, or if I needed powerful magic, Lucinil would be there to help me.

"Lucinil is much more versatile than I am, so he'll be able to cover the drop-off better than I can."

She wonders what kind of debt she owes that the Lord of Demand would help her like this. Elise seems to trust Lucinil quite a bit, even if the other Lord Vampires don't.

"Boffin, Elise, that makes me feel like I'm beneath him."

"Oh, sorry, Lucinyl. I'll correct that to protection."

"Chit."

"When you say protection, you make it sound like I'm some kind of child who needs a babysitter."

"Wasn't it ......?"

"Chet."

I have to admit.

It's not really a nanny, but it's nice to have an archmage around, and since Eleris is busy with other things for the time being, it's like having another archmage around.

Lucinil is a homunculus vampire who seems like just a goofy kid on the outside, but is really just a kid cosplaying as a homunculus.

"Get ready. We're coming."

Lucinil signals to me when she's done casting.

"Jae-hyung, take care of yourself."

Elise looks at me with concern.

"You be careful, too."

Somehow.

I have this weird, bizarre feeling that I'm being separated from my parents for life!

Soon, Lucinil triggered a mass teleport.
