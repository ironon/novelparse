We don't know when Ellen will get to the truth. But it was clear that Ellen was going to find out a lot more than she bargained for.

There's no stopping Ellen.

Something I did provoked the Crusaders, and someone digging into the case to investigate it got a lead.

And was killed.

Tracking down an incident without knowing anything is bound to take a long time.

The culprits are never caught, but Ellen is about to learn a very unpleasant truth.

We don't know what judgment Ellen would make in the face of that truth.

I can't get in Ellen's way.

So, I do what I have to do.

So now.

"Why....... are you here?"

I watched as the crusader leader shook with fear.

"Well, I didn't think I'd be sitting here either until a few days ago."

My first contact was with the Pope of the Order of Als.

At the convened meeting, I confirmed the support of the other four popes for my candidacy.

And finally.

Elayon Bolton, Crusader Knight Commander.

"I think we can all agree, even if it was my people who caused the Gate, I didn't want it to happen. You know that, don't you?"

"The five great and sublime popes have now recognized my intentions, and they have agreed to support me in the future, though they cannot do so openly....... So we'll negotiate behind the scenes, until the time is right."

"I wish you would have trusted me sooner, but it's sad that trust can only be earned after the fact, but what the heck, that was then, this is now."

"Okay, we're going to make this a solid, sticky, tight relationship."

"There will be no more division, no more infighting, no more eye-rolling, because you're tired, that sort of thing."

"Now trust me, your prophet, and empty your brains."

"You're the only one left, Crusader."

The look on Elayon Bolton's face as he listened to the story of how, unbeknownst to him, the leaders of the Order had already turned to the Devil's side.

He looked like he'd lost everything overnight.

"You know, if you refuse, it's going to tear the Grand Master and the Templars apart, and even within the Templars, it's going to tear them apart into factions that support the Pope and factions that support the Grand Master."

"Are you willing to gamble with the fate of humanity and the Order?"

"Or do you want to just come in here under me and pretend nothing happened?"

"You like that."

"Status quo."

I never thought I would have to make a threat like this.

Elion Bolton is not without veto power.

It's just that if you refuse, you won't die alone.

There will be a civil war, and a civil war is the end of humanity.

If you start screaming about how there's a demon in the ecliptic, you're going to cause chaos across the entire ecliptic, not just the Order.

If you come under me, you betray humanity.

But if you don't get under my skin, humanity may cease to exist.

He has to think about something he never thought about until he walked into the room.

In a short period of time, he will put a lot of things on the scale and put them down.

Elion Bolton is not a big fan of change.

But that's not technically the point.

If you don't like change, there's an underlying fear and reluctance to disrupt. Hence the status quo.

I want it.

But when you realize that everything is bound to change.

When you realize that it's impossible not to change.

"......No options."

They change more easily than anyone else in the world.

Elayon Bolton stares at me, his eyes burning with hatred for the five popes who handed everything over to him.

"What do you want, demon?"

"I told you, the status quo you like."

But once again, my ramblings raised eyebrows, not only at Elion Bolton, but also at the five popes.

"......what?"

"That's all you need to do."

I am here to stop the feud between the Crusader Knights and the Five Great Houses.

It's just that it eats them up.

The popes were preparing to join me, and the Crusader leader was uncomfortable with the move.

You will then need to raise one of your hands.

The Empire can't lift the hand of a Crusader Templar. It would cause a backlash from the popes.

But I can support the popes. The popes can override any pushback from the Crusaders.

"What, did you think I was going to come out and say I want to wipe out the human race, so kill them all, because that's not going to happen."

"......."

"Keep it this way. There's no need to set up a conflict in the empire. I'll be the liver or the gallbladder for those of you who want to be the liver and the gallbladder, so to speak."

All that talk of swallowing them up is just talk.

There is only one reason why the popes were willing to change, and only one reason why they really did.

They know I have no intention of turning against humanity. They know I'm not going to ask them to do anything crazy.

It's just taking advantage of me.

"So let's get this out of the way and get to the most important thing."

You can gain the cooperation of the Crusader Knights and the Five Great Houses. And if you want to rule, you can rule. But that is not possible right now.

And these serpentine old papists will treat me like the traitor of the century again when they decide I've outlived my usefulness and the Empire is stronger.

It's not exactly gross and disgusting.

It flips like the palm of your hand depending on the power dynamic.

If you're weak, you'll be ignored; if you're strong, you'll be ignored.

Right now, they don't really know what the empire is doing.

That's why I'm trying to take my side. The Devil himself and his forces believe they can erase humanity at any time.

And it's true.

Elion Bolton realized that the situation was irreversible, and he was faced with a situation where he had to think long and hard, but only short.

So I figured he should cooperate with me, no matter how he felt about it.

More importantly.

"Rowen, did you kill him?"

The real killer of Rowen.

I want to know it.

Was she purged, as Bertus said?

"No."

Elion Bolton shakes his head.

"I didn't kill him."

The Empire did not kill Rowen.

Bertus raised the possibility of a purge.

But the popes said they didn't do it.

"That's weird, even the popes here said they didn't do it, so unless you're the culprit. Who the hell killed Rowen?"

The leader of the Crusaders says he didn't do it.

"I tried to kill him, that's a fact."

The popes' expressions couldn't help but change.

"But I didn't kill Rowen, though I don't know about the other interrogators."

"Hmmm....... That means......."

There are a number of possibilities, but unless they're lying, this is the most likely one.

"No way, he's not dead?"

That's right, self-inflicted.

"That's right. The body was a fake with a face mask on."

Rowen is not dead.



* * *



A fire has broken out on site.

That was weird.

The whole time, it bothered me.

That's overly conspicuous.

If it's a purge, it should be stealthy and all evidence should be destroyed.

But if Elion Bolton or the Popes had tried to purge Rowen, the fire should not have happened.

Fire draws too much attention to itself.

So if this is a purge, there shouldn't have been a fire.

But a fire broke out, and an unspecified number of people saw the temple on fire. So the looters came in droves.

And Ludwig saw it, and it reached Ellen, and now she's after the truth.

"Yeah....... I mean, it's almost like the fire was started in hopes that someone would find out that they were torturing civilians to death in the basement of the temple."

A fire breaks out, and civilians enter to loot the temple. The horrific sight of the basement goes unnoticed by the civilians, partly because no looters are crazy enough to go into the basement of a burning building, and partly because Elion Bolton is quick on the uptake.

But in the end, there was no stopping Ellen, even if she did see the basement.

It was an attention-grabbing incident in the first place.

It's not impossible that the Crusaders and Popes are lying right in front of me.

But it's very odd that they ended up forcing it into the spotlight.

And Rowen's body was fake in the first place.

Inquisitor Rowen is alive and well.

"Why were you keeping that a secret?"

The Pope of the Cult of Tuan asked, glaring at the leader of the Crusader Knights.

"You've never even hinted to me that the popes would make a deal like this if they had the chance."

The Pope of the Tuan Order, as well as the others, grew sullen at the mention of a subject who had betrayed mankind and had been labeled a demon.

"A new....... This is also a decision for the good of humanity......."

"Shut up."

I'm the one who said that, not Elion Bolton.

Disgusting assholes.

They've gotten under my skin, and it doesn't look good.

I don't want to clean up traffic.

I just want to get this over with and get back to eating Ellen's jerky.

"So it's true that you tried to kill Rowen, but I don't know the details, but you failed to do so?"

"Yeah."

In response, the Pope of the Order of Tuan glares at Elayon Bolton.

"Captain, why did you want to kill Archbishop Rowen in the first place?"

Even if Rowen didn't die in the end, we know that Elion Bolton tried and failed to kill her.

"I ordered them to stop all investigations, but they didn't listen."

"......."

At that, the popes all fell silent.

Of course, Elion Bolton knows what he's talking about.

If you mess with the empire, you'll be in trouble.

After returning to the ecliptic, Elayon Bolton would have updated Rowen, who would have been in charge of the case, on the progress of the investigation.

The empire is suspicious.

Elion Bolton's orders would have been simple. Dig no more.

"I think it's safe to say that digging for an empire at this time of year is not a very good idea....... I'm sure you'll agree."

The five popes looked uncomfortable, but that didn't stop them from directly refuting Elion Bolton's statement.

The popes think about joining me, but that doesn't mean they want to fight the Empire.

An incident in the basement of the Crusaders' Great War.

Tracking it down, Lowen realized that the Empire might be the culprit. So he approached Ludwig.

But when Elayon Bolton found out, he tried to stop Rowen, believing that messing with the Empire would destroy the entire Order.

But Rowen disobeyed the Crusader leader's orders.

Elayon Bolton had a plan to purge his men who would touch the powder keg, and he carried it out.

"Loyal as a dog, and then there's a case of obvious foul play and they won't let me investigate it, they even tried to purge me......."

He would have seen his men killed by the Crusaders, not any other faction, with his own eyes.

"If your eyes don't roll, that's a weird situation."

I could see Elion Bolton gritting his teeth as I spoke.

The other Inquisitors are almost certainly dead, and the paladins sent by Elayon Bolton for the purge are almost certainly dead to Rowen.

It's no wonder you feel betrayed by the Five Great Houses.

Rowen disguised one of the corpses as himself, set the temple on fire, and fled. By faking his death and fleeing, he bought himself some time.

I have no idea what you're going to do with all that extra time.

At the end of the day, Elion Bolton's behavior is at the center of this case.

But what if I were Elion Bolton?

The Empire had nothing to do with the theft of the Crusaders' underground remains, but they were powering the bodies of their fallen.

Just digging into the case creates friction with the empire.

It's dangerous enough to pry into the empire, and Rowen would have argued that he had no choice but to pry into this case.

In the end, Elayon Bolton was only half successful in his purge. He killed all of Rowen's men, but failed to kill Rowen himself.

Half of them failed, and Rowen disappeared, leaving only a fake corpse behind.

"Whatever happens next, it doesn't change the fact that it's my fault. I wasn't perfect."

The Crusader leader made what he thought was the best choice, but in the end he was unable to kill Rowen.

No one knows what kind of ripples it will cause.

"I don't know what Rowen is going to do, but we need....... Coincidentally, we need you the most."

What are you talking about.

Do you need me?

It wasn't Elion Bolton who answered.

"I don't know what the Devil thinks, but....... Rowen was a radical."

These were the words of the Pope of the Order of Tuan.

"Radicals?"

"Within the Cult, especially within the Tuan and Als, there are....... there are many such priests."

"What kind of priest is that?"

"Those who believe in the devil as a prophet."

"......?"

What is he saying?

"There are quite a few people who believe that the devil is the true prophet."

What the heck does that mean?

"It's not just the two denominations."

These were the words of the Pope of the Order of the Ritter.

"On that day, the paladins and priests who saw you in the temple....... You know they were no small number."

Even Elion Bolton said it.

"They were high-ranking paladins and priests of the Order, and Rowen was among them."

I didn't want a gate situation.

The priests I saw explaining how to deal with the gate situation because it was too late.

Only high-ranking priests and paladins with proven divine powers and skills could be there in the first place.

The future of the church saw me as I was then.

That means they know as well as I do that I didn't really want a gate situation.

"Do you realize now that I didn't make this choice just to save face?"

While lower-level priests and paladins may not know, those at the highest levels of the Church are bound to know the truth of the Gate situation to some degree.

Therefore, you must be perceiving yourself differently than the world perceives you.

"Archbishop Rowen, among others, has been quite supportive of you."

The upper echelons of the Five Great Houses were being filled with my followers.

Psychologically, there were more and more people supporting me than the empire.

If the popes are going to be on my side, it's not just their judgment.

It was inevitable: public opinion.
