            Episode 313.





Putting on a dress and applying makeup to get ready for Miss Temple isn't something you can do all day.

After taking off her dress and removing her makeup, Ellen took a shower.

Riana didn't just go over the dress code and makeup, she also had me practice my facial expressions. She says you have to be prepared.

It didn't seem like she had done much, but the unfamiliarity of it all made Ellen feel very tired now. Both physically and mentally.

That didn't mean I didn't like it.

I realized that I was discovering a completely different version of myself that I didn't even know I had, so I looked in the mirror and thought, "Is this me?" dozens of times a day.

Ellen dried all of her hair and laid back down on her bed.

Tomorrow is the start of the Miss Temple contest.

-curl

Ellen narrowed her eyes at the rumbling in her stomach.

Normally, it's time for a late-night snack with Reinhard. Ellen thinks of Riana's firm caution.

"You, don't pick up anything tonight.

"......Why?

"I know you're not gaining weight, but what if you eat something the night before and your face is puffy the next day?

"......I'm not sure.

"If you're not going to eat it anyway, don't eat it. Maybe another day, but not today.

"......Yes.

I'm not saying starve yourself, I'm saying don't eat late at night, but you can do that. I can handle it for a day.

But routines are scary.

-cough

"......."

When you don't eat at the time you usually eat something, and your body is telling you that you shouldn't.

What's more, when someone tells you not to do something, it makes you want to do it even more.

I've gone to bed without eating a midnight snack quite a few times, and now I'm even hungrier because I know I shouldn't be eating today.

Normally, Ellen is very self-controlled. But even when she does eat, she tends not to gain weight due to her physical activity and constitution, and there is always plenty of food in the Royal Class dormitory. She even stuck with Reinhardt, who would do anything for her.

Ellen realizes that she has rarely been able to resist eating lately.

Still, I must do better tomorrow. I can't keep my hunger down this long.

I'm trying to force myself to fall asleep, but I can't.

Maybe it was the moonlight streaming through the window. Ellen scrambled out of bed to draw the curtains.

And.

Holding the curtains closed, Ellen could see the street outside her dorm.

In the dark, under the moonlight.

You see two familiar faces.

Reinhard and Herriot de Saint-Ouen.

They were walking, hand in hand.

"......."

Ellen stays still, watching the scene from inside her room.

Harriet walking beside Reinhardt with her head down in shame, and Reinhardt walking beside her, holding her hand slightly.

Ellen watched the spectacle, frozen in place.

Hold hands.

What a special act that is.

I've held her hand as many times as I can, and I've hugged her as many times as I can.

I've done it myself. I've been friends with Reinhard for as long as I can remember.

So, it falls into the category of things that friends do, and that's how it should be understood.

You have to understand that it's perfectly acceptable.

But.

Ellen can't take her eyes off their clasped hands.

Already.

Was it taken away?

No.

A long time ago.

It's an illusion to think that there's something that only you can reach.



"Long time no see!



Actually, already.

A long time ago.

Is that what happened?

Why are those two.

Substitution.

A hand is something you can hold.

It's a hand I've held many times myself.

I thought it was my privilege to be able to touch Reinhardt, so when I saw that he and Harriet were merely holding hands.

My heart is like, why is this.

Is it precariously close to breaking.



'Me, me, you know....... Really, really....... sometimes.'

'I think you're really, really mean.......'



Something Herriot had said once echoed in Ellen's head.

Ellen suddenly realizes that Harriet has always felt this way.

In a place you don't know. Watching from afar as they create stories and memories you don't know.

You've created a relationship that you can't break.

You have to watch it, and you can't do anything about it.

So this is what it feels like.

You feel betrayed, you don't know what to do, you're angry, you're upset, and you're frustrated.

Herriot summarized this feeling in one word: cheesy.

I don't think that's the best way to put it.

Ellen sees them walking back to the dorm.

It may be too late.

She's doing what she has to do. There is no need or reason to hate her. To hate that, Ellen would have to have been hated by Herriot long ago.

Ellen tries to convince herself that Harriet is doing her own thing, and that she doesn't have to hate her for it.

So, you do what you need to do.

You just have to be good tomorrow. If Reinhardt sees himself tomorrow, he might be a little different than he is today.

We'll talk about this and that, and maybe we'll do things a little differently.

That's it.

Today is today, and tomorrow is tomorrow.

Ellen squeezed her eyes shut, trying to erase the lingering images of the two of them from her mind.

That night.

I swung my sword in the smoke screen.

No Cliffhanger, no Ellen. So I banged on the scarecrow for the first time in a while. I could have asked Tana, the violinist, to teach me, but it was getting late, and I knew I wouldn't be able to get to bed on time if she did.

So, I swung my water sword at the scarecrow.

-Puck!

"......itis."

Your water sword is broken.

I don't think I've ever been that into swords as much as I am into trance.

What it is.

I forgot the time.

I was already well past my standard bedtime. It was time to call it a night, even with Saviolin Tana's lessons.

My whole body was drenched in sweat.

I gathered up the remains of my broken water lily sword and tossed it into the trash, then opened the window to the smokehouse.

A stinging cold breeze brushed against my cheeks and sweaty clothes.

Me Now.

Apparently, you're upset.

What should I do?

I couldn't figure it out.

It was well past my bedtime, and I knew I'd break it again if I tried to swing it, so I decided to get cleaned up and get some sleep.

I thought about doing something, but I didn't feel like doing anything by myself without Ellen.

"Uh."

I walked down the hallway and bumped into someone. He looked at me and scratched his head.

It wasn't anyone else who ran into me, but Bertus.

Aren't you busy managing your horsepower train? What's going on in the dorms at this hour?

"What, you're not going to bed until this time?"

Bertus said what I would have said.

"Some from the haze."

"...... Training late at night on a festival. That's amazing."

Bertus smirked.

"What about you?"

"Oh....... I've been working a bit, and now I'm going to take a break."

The festivities aren't over yet, are we done with the Zodiacal Horsepower Train?

Whether it was the vigil or too much work, Bertus had dark circles under his eyes. You shouldn't be praising me for training during the festival, shouldn't you? You're more uptight than usual.

"Oh, I heard you won the tournament. Congratulations."

"Uh....... Yeah."

Bertus patted me on the shoulder and walked toward his room. If the fatigue on his iron mask was any indication, he'd had a rough couple days.

He was about to go on his way, but then he looked back in my direction as if he suddenly remembered something.

"Oh....... Wait a minute."

"Uh....... Why?"

A cold sweat breaks out all over my body.

All the others passed with flying colors.

This one is not yet.

This is the first time he's seen me since he saw me cross-dressing.

Bertus narrows his eyes and glares at me.

No?

You're not recognizing me, are you? Honestly, I mean, we've met face-to-face, but it's been a quick glance.

"Hmmm......."

Bertus stared at me, frowning, and then shook his head.

"No, you look a little tired."

Bertus made a spine-chilling noise and went back into his room.



* * *



Entering his dormitory room, Bertus dragged his heavy body through the water, bathed, and flopped down on his bed.

Manage the operation of horsepower trains during festivals.

I didn't think it was a big deal. The Horse Train is the most important mode of transportation on the Yellow Road, and even at this time of year, riders come from all continents.

Goro.

Some people have never seen or heard of a horsepower train in their lives.

Children cry because they see a monster running, and adults run away in a panic.

This one's for you.

Even in the far corners of the continent, there is such a thing as status.

If you're willing to travel all the way to the ecliptic to see the temple festival, you've got the money to pay for the warp gate.

That's why, in general, those who are more retarded in their own region come to the ecliptic.

Not to mention, there's a whole bunch of people who want to know why there's no noble carriage on the magic train. There are plenty of people who ask how they can use the same transportation as commoners.

It's almost laughable to think of ants doing sequencing, but Bertus had to be good at it.

It was stressful trying to resolve every incident and mishap as smoothly as possible.

I didn't even get a chance to rest, so I went back to my dorm, thinking I'd call it a night.

Bertus's head is about to explode.

But when I looked at Reinhardt, something clicked.

You're too caught up in work to think about it, but you remember the girl you ran into last time.

The moment I saw Reinhardt, I immediately thought of that silver-haired girl.

Unforgettable.

Bertus can't get the look off his face for the rest of his life when he makes the ridiculous mistake of spewing black tea in the face of a woman he's never met before.

'Looks alike, apparently.

I thought maybe I was mistaken because I was tired, but after thinking about it, there's a definite resemblance.

Of course, you'd have to stand them up next to each other to get the full picture.

There's no doubt that the silver-haired girl and Reinhardt look a lot alike.

But Bertus's thinking takes a strange turn.

First.

Bertus is busy and unaware of the festivities. At best, he knows that Reinhardt won the first grade tournament.

So we don't know who the silver-haired girl is, and we don't know that she competed in the Temple pageant.

So, to Bertus, a silver-haired girl is just a silver-haired girl.

Two very different things.

But it's similar.

He even looks like he's got a bit of a mouth.

I was curious about the silver hair, so I asked her about it, and she said it was dyed.

And Reinhardt is from the streets.

"Does Reinhardt have a brother or sister?

It's entirely possible that Reinhardt didn't know he had blood relatives, even if he did.

Just ask Reinhardt.

Do you have a younger brother or sister?

Of course, you'll get a don't know or a yes or no answer, but Reinhardt will wonder why you're even asking.

"Well, maybe not, maybe not.

I'm just wondering if it's possible to have an unnecessary human resemblance.

Reinhardt would be pretty disappointed if you told him that you met someone you thought was your brother or sister, when it wasn't.

'Let's talk about it.......'

You don't even have to tell Reinhardt.

If it's true, it could lead Reinhardt to his lost blood relatives.

If not, it's just a matter of returning the handkerchief that wasn't returned.

Thinking it was nothing more than a frivolous task, Bertus slowly became immersed in Suma.
