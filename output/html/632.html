            Episode 632.





Arnaria, the White Palace, had always been a tranquil palace, but now it was even more so.

Far from bleak, it's deserted.

Silence can inspire a certain amount of fear, but the silence of Arnaria was more like stillness.

The Archduke was right about it being a lonely place, but it was still lonely.

The Archduke climbed up the stairs to where I could see Arnaria in the distance.

The Archduke said nothing.

He walked a bit ahead of me, and I followed, waiting to see what he would say.

I felt like I was being punished.

Honestly, I'm on the hook.

I'm here to tell the Archduke to take my side in a situation where I have ten mouths to feed.

If I've gotten to this point in my impatience, I should be able to understand if the Archduke tries to cut my throat.

The Archduke is a man who has suffered tremendously because of my presence.

His reputation is in tatters because his daughter disappeared with a demon, he's hated by the people of his duchy, and he's favored by the Alliance.

The St. Thuan family's long-standing reputation as a path of righteousness has been tarnished in an instant.

What is honor.

To most people, this would be meaningless, but to someone like the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan, it's very important.

It was all evaporated by my mere presence.

The Archduke was silent for a long time, and I couldn't help but think of the palace.

I wonder how everyone is doing.

Her mother or her brothers.

My brothers are all mages, so I know they're in the Alliance, and I know they're safe.

But there's a world of difference between being okay and getting along.

I couldn't bring myself to say anything because I didn't feel qualified to even ask how everyone was doing.

For almost an hour.

The Archduke said nothing, and I was a honeyed mute.

It didn't feel like I was being punished, but I was.

After that long, long silence.

"That's weird."

The Archduke said that out of the blue.

Weird?

The Archduke glares at me.

"No matter how you look at it, you appear to be fidgeting......."

Actually, it does.

So if you're confident in this situation, doesn't that make it even weirder?

Is that the kind of thing that says, "Roll up your sleeves and come out swinging"?

"Well, it's....... Me......."

"......."

I want to say something, but I can't find the words.

I have nothing to say to the Archduke that I wouldn't say to anyone else.

I'm sure the Archduke knows that I didn't kidnap Harriet, I just followed her. But what's the point of that, when it's already bad enough that I've kept a secret and befriended his daughter?

The Archduke looks at me.

"Do you think I've done something wrong?"

No.

So if this isn't wrong, what is?

"It's ......."

I have no idea what the Archduke is thinking.

"Hmmm......."

The Archduke considers, then nods slowly.

"Okay, so tell me about it."

Did he mean to say "quit your job"?

"What do you think you've done wrong so far?"

The Archduke walks with a cane.

Standing in front of me like a judge, he said.

"Whatever you did to me."

"Whatever you did to my daughter."

"If you....... for example."

"Oh my God."

"Whatever they did to humanity."

"If you think something is wrong, what is it."

One who has never been untouched when it comes to evil power and trickery.

A man who pursued righteousness with righteous strength, who was noble and lived for righteousness and justice.

Someone who hasn't done anything wrong, but has lost so much because of me.

Someone who has done, and continues to do, what they are supposed to do, without a single bit of bitterness or resentment.

Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan.

"Tell me about it."

He is, perhaps, the one who is qualified to judge me.

It's been a long story.

But in the end, it boiled down to trying to save everyone and bringing everything to this point.

What Akasha is, who Cantus Magna was, and why he created Richie's Tomb. How Akasha was originally intended to be used.

By the time I realized everything, it was too late.

I had been lying for so long that no one could trust me, and the people who felt the most betrayed could only hate me.

The story of trying to change the future and ending up making it happen.

If I hadn't done anything, nothing would have happened.

"Not chosen by the gods, but cursed by them."

The Grand Duke, having heard the whole story, said simply.

Are you saying that having two holy relics of the gods is a curse, not a blessing?

"Not you, but mankind is cursed."

But as if reading my mind, the Archduke corrected himself.

A curse on humanity?

"If the demon had no intention of harming humanity, and was using Akasha to escape to another world, there was no reason to fight."

Bali wanted escape, not war.

Fearing the threat of the demons, humanity invaded the Darklands and wiped out most of the demons, as well as their king.

Instead of trying to understand, I was afraid.

This happened because of a misunderstanding.

"Did I not cause the destruction of mankind by misunderstanding that my neighbor would kill me, and by misunderstanding I destroyed my neighbor?"

And the Gate debacle was all about misunderstanding and misinterpretation.

"Whether you want revenge or not, the truth remains that the Devil has taken the most decisive and certain revenge on mankind."

Regardless of my intentions, in the end it wasn't revenge, but at the same time I couldn't say it wasn't revenge.

I played the biggest role in the extinction of humanity.

That truth never changes.

"How can I do this, and not be cursed by the gods?"

You killed your neighbor in a misunderstanding, so you get it back in a misunderstanding.

This was the gods' judgment and curse upon mankind, or so the Archduke seemed to think.



* * *



Is this a curse from the gods?

The Archduke looks up at the grayish sky.

"Of course, we'll never know if this is truly a curse from the gods or a mere coincidence."

If it was just a terrible coincidence, how could we calculate the probability?

"But even if this is a curse from the gods, it doesn't take away your sin, and it doesn't make you innocent. It doesn't change the fact that it all came from you."

Yes.

I don't want to say that I didn't do anything wrong.

No sin, no accountability, no going away.

The Gate debacle happened to save me.

Antirrhinus impulsed, Sarkhegar insisted, and Eleris activated Akasha.

That, too, is a stark truth.

"But is it not too harsh to say that you would rather have been dead?"

"......."

"I woke up with all my memories gone, my country gone, my father, king of a world and absolute, gone with the warriors, and the last heir to a fallen nation, with nothing more than a stigma. He knows only one thing: the world is about to end......."

"......."

"How did you make it this far, or rather, how did you get here....... Isn't it miraculous......."

The fact that I was the last Archdemon of a doomed realm was an extremely unfavorable condition for my survival.

It would have been better to be a man on the street, a nobody.

But in the end, I came close to destroying the world, and in the end, I rebuilt the Darklands, which is now inhabited by humans.

A lot of coincidences saved me, and a lot of coincidences got me into this mess in the end.

But in the end, he became the rebuilt King of the Demon Realm.

How did they do it.

The Archduke thought it was bizarre, and I thought back to the beginning and wondered how it was possible to do what I had done.

If someone had told me that I would be where I am now, years after I started, I wouldn't have believed them either.

"You may not be the most powerful demon in history, but you are the greatest demon in history."

That's how it works.

Rebuilding a destroyed nation.

We've rebuilt Darklands.

Therefore, I was able to face the Archduke as one who could call himself a demon, not a Reinhardt.

And perish.

It also succeeded in taking revenge on humanity.

I didn't do it all by choice.

However, the demon has done everything it was supposed to do.

"Now you've brought humanity to the brink of destruction, and you have the potential to become master of the entire world. You are the greatest, most perfect demon who ever lived."

And to be the master of the world.

"Isn't it pathetic that you, who never wanted the life of a demon, have become the closest thing to fulfilling the Archdemons' desires that anyone has ever achieved?"

I didn't want to be the devil.

I didn't want to be a king.

"Archdemons must be cursed to never live the life they want."

Yes.

If Archdemon is a race with such a curse.

Rebuilding Darklands when we didn't want to rebuild Darklands.

I can understand this situation where you don't want to see the end of humanity, but it's happened.

In the lineage of generations of Archdemons, I may be the only one who didn't want to be a demon and didn't hate humans.

Therefore, I have destroyed all mankind, rebuilt destroyed nations, and have the opportunity to make the whole world mine.

Is there really such a thing as a curse?

That's why the demons keep failing.

"That's a big deal."

"What's the big deal?"

If you have a curse like that, you're in trouble.

"Because the gate crisis will never end."

If an Archdemon has such a curse, there will never be an end to the gate situation.

Then it's bullshit again.

It's enough to send chills down your spine.

"Haha....... I see."

The Archduke laughed weakly at my words.

I don't know if there is such a curse or not.

Most importantly, it seemed to convey to the Archduke that I was desperate for the Gate debacle to end.

"So in the end, it's your fault?"

The Archduke said, "Tell me if I'm wrong.

So I said what has happened so far.

"That's the....... I put Harriet in....... and it's my fault for doing so......."

It's his own fault for following him, but it's the Archduke's fault in the end.

"You haven't heard from me since....... You must have been worried. Anyway....... It's all my fault. The world is the way it is, and it's all......."

"What has the world come to?"

"Yes."

"Why is that wrong?"

The Archduke looks at me.

"You said the world is the way it is because of me, so it's my fault......."

"All of that may be your sin, but why is it your fault?"

Are you saying that sin and wrong are different?

I couldn't figure out what he was really trying to say.

"Let's say you really did cause the gate incident with the intention of destroying the human race. Let's say you did."

The Archduke taps his cane against the marble staircase, and Nazik says, "You're right.

"You, you can't do that, can you?"

"......Yes?"

What does that mean?

"The Darklands never thought of war with humans, until they invaded the Demon Realm and destroyed your country, killed your fathers, killed those who were like family, and even enslaved you."

a.

"If, after what has happened to you, you have tried to destroy the human race, who is to say that it is unjust for you to have such a heart and to do such a thing, that it is wrong?"

Many died.

If I did it because I really wanted to, it would be a sin.

But it wasn't unfair.

The Archduke is talking about revenge.

Killing and murdering out of revenge is a sin because it cannot be justified in the end.

However, the vengeance may be justified.

Sin is right.

However, it is possible to do so.

You could have.

That's what the Archduke is saying.

I am what I am.

So you may be guilty, but you're not at fault.

That was what the Archduke was saying.

The first thing he asked me was, "If you think I've done something wrong, tell me.

The Archduke didn't say I did anything wrong.

"I did you wrong."

"......Yes?"

"If the War of the Demons was wrong from the start, then it was not you who was at fault, but I who did it to you first."

The Archduke was a participant in the Demon War.

So if the Demon War is a war gone wrong, then the result is the destruction of Darklands.

It was the Archduke, not me, who had committed an irremediable sin.

"Even if it was a just war, it's only natural that the heir to the ruins would seek revenge on all those who fought in the Great Demon War."

"......."

Ever since I knew I was a demon.

The Archduke believed that everything I did to humanity, however sinful, was justified.

I was justified in everything I was doing because I had a right to revenge on every human being.

The Archduke is technically one of your enemies.

As an archmage, the Archduke would naturally have had a great deal of experience in the Demon War, and that experience would have been earned by killing demons.

If I were a real Bali, the Grand Duke would be the one whose name would have to be very high up on the list when I wrote down that I was a murderer.

"Why do you come with the look of a sinner to the dwelling place of your enemies to apologize?"

In the past, I've worn a human mask, but since it's known that I'm a demon, that mask hasn't changed, even in situations where it's appropriate to remove it.

"I, I don't understand it."

The Archduke didn't seem to understand, coming here with the demeanor of a guilty man, looking on.

"Yeah......."

The Archduke looks up at the sky.

Beyond not even having the vengeance he should have, he doesn't really have a grain of wheat's worth of hatred, but rather only thinks about what I did wrong to the Archduke.

"My daughter was right."

The Archduke said so with a hint of something, a deep guilt in his voice.

"You may have sinned, but you have not done wrong."

The Archduke mumbles to himself.

"I have sinned and done wrong."

After learning the truth about the Demon War, the truth about the Ancestral Demon Valie, the Demon War was nothing but killing.

Humanity was not saved by the destruction of demons.

This brought back the gate situation.

It turns out I wasn't the only one who just needed to be still.

In the first place, it was a matter of humanity standing still.

I'm not a Valerie.

That's why there's no such thing as a vendetta against the Archduke.

The Archduke is just misunderstanding.

When I say it all came down to me, I don't mean because I caused the gate.

This absurdity was created from scratch by my own hands.

So there was no revenge or resentment or anything like that, just a deepening of the guilt.

Like the Archduke feels guilty about me.

Me, I couldn't help but feel guilty.
