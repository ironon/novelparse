Honoree banquet.

As a banquet to bring together the people responsible for the Gate debacle, the size of the arrivals was significant.

There were tons of people, and naturally, the Palace of Spring was bustling.

It's a gathering of people who have made a huge impact, so it's not just the big names from all over the world, but also individuals who are not big names but have made a great impact.

It's a banquet to which most of the people who are the backbone of the empire are invited, so it's a big deal, and the Emperor and all five Empresses attend.

The last of the five empresses to arrive was Airi.

Her presence is enough to make people fall silent.

Succubus Queen.

The bloodline of one of the greatest demons of all time.

She's a member of a race of succubi called seductresses, which are considered the great demons, so it's no wonder she's in the spotlight.

"Hello?"

"Yes."

When they reach the second floor, where the Emperor is, Airi nods in agreement.

People are mesmerized for a while, then they go back to telling stories and dancing.

There are also those who secretly glance in the direction of Airi.

Airi was originally a representative of the demons who married the Emperor.

I thought so too.

In reality, Airi is in charge of the demons, and her main job is to find the remaining hordes of demons in the Darklands and integrate them into the Empire.

Charlotte is also an Archdemon, but she doesn't have the energy to run the entire empire, so Airi does.

"No matter how you look at it, of all the empresses, you have the most support for this....... Isn't that a little odd?"

Airi smiles subtly at the Emperor's words.

"You don't know what's going on in the world."

Nicknamed Mafu, Airi is actually the most recognizable among humans.

Archmage.

The last Empress of the Imperial House of Gradias.

Regent of Cernstadt.

Ruler of the Holy Empire.

They're all great at what they do, but Airi is the only demon.

Humans support Airi for one reason only.

The most beautiful empress.

It lives up to its nickname, the Archdemon of Seduction, by keeping things simple.

I can't tell you how much that alone has changed the way humans perceive demons, and how much money it would take to win that with propaganda.

When the Demon Empress was revealed to the world, Charlotte did not stand idly by as soon as she realized the perception was spreading among the people.

Just like we did in Edina.

We had succubi doing psychological counseling, and we had the empress doing poverty work.

The only Empress of Demons among the Emperor's Empresses, she serves the people in the lowliest of positions.

Airi and the other succubi had been doing it long enough on the Edina Archipelago to have their teeth chattering, and it was something they loved to do.

So, ironically, unlike the other empresses, whose heavy duties made it difficult for them to travel outside, Airi was the empress closest to the people of the zodiac.

Public outreach to raise awareness of demons.

Airi might not be the only one.

As such, Airi was the only Empress of the demons, and the most famous and supported.

There are even humans who hate the Emperor but support Empress Airi.

Airi won people over in the simplest, most obvious way.

"Maybe we'll get some new Shadowwalkers this time."

"Really?"

"Yeah, we're a pretty grim species, but we've survived because we're good at hiding. They like dark places and have good ears. Don't worry, they're not cannibals. I could work in intelligence. I wouldn't mind living in the ecliptic."

"Good."

Of course, that doesn't change the fact that she's also an advocate and protector of the demons.

It's a place where humans are the majority, but eventually, demons have to live alongside them.

The demons, who cannot live in the land of the humans, must be given a home, and a place where only they can live.

The Emperor stares down at the banquet hall.

Some faces you recognize, some you don't.

Some faces I haven't seen in a while.

As they greeted each other, some of whom hadn't seen each other in a long time, they stared down at the emperor.

The emperor stays still and looks in the opposite direction.

It's not Irie, it's Scarlett, who's always there.

"Go down."

"Yes, Your Majesty, but I'm......."

In a ballroom where everyone is wearing a dress or suit, Scarlett is still wearing her armor.

"Come on, let's go say hi to Ivia."

If you're going to stick around this long, why not say hello?

The Emperor watched as Scarlett hesitated and walked down the stairs.



* * *



The entire Spring Palace was like a banquet hall, with tons of people eating and drinking everywhere.

Naturally, cliques congregate, and there were people all over the ballroom.

There's a lot of gossip, and it can range from private to public.

Among the stories buried in the music, some people were happy to see each other after a long time.

But there were also a lot of familiar faces in the room.

Such is the case with Harriet and Adelia, who have been apart for a while, but now meet up every chance they get and mumble, just like they did in Temple.

The two of them were muttering now, papers lined up on the banquet table.

"I'm not sure how efficient this would be, but wouldn't it be a little less versatile? I'd like to be able to use it in ways other than harvesting."

"No, that's not how it works. Because there's a joint here in the front, and if you replace it, it'll look like this."

"Yeah, and?"

"Then you can act as a plow, and you can sell as much land as you want."

"Ah....... I see. It's efficient because you can swap out parts to make it versatile. The core is the same, so it's easy to repurpose."

"Right."

As Adelia and Harriet talk about it in the ballroom, Riana, who's emptying her champagne glass, slams it down as if it's not good enough.

-Tak!

"What the hell, you come all the way over here to make me smell like manure?"

"Huh?"

"Oh......?"

"Do I have to come all the way out here and listen to you talk about building a farming golem? I don't know about you guys, but I'm sick of it."

At Riana's words, both Adelia and Harriet reorganized the pile of plans on the table.

Herriot's reaction to the initially awkward topic prompted Adelia to pull out her design drawings and start fidgeting.

It's no wonder Riana's not thrilled with the idea of getting all dolled up and wearing earrings, necklaces, and a fancy dress.

Cliffman chuckled beside him.

"......Funny?"

"Sorry......."

Naturally, he laughed without thinking, and with one glance, Kliffman hung his head.

Riana can't help but have a seizure at the mention of farming.

Liana was the general manager of the vast Saint-Tuan Agricultural District, the breadbasket of the empire.

Agriculture to livestock, forestry to fisheries, and processing afterward.

When it comes to food, Liana de Granz is in charge of everything.

Once an absolute powerhouse when it came to war, Riana's psychic powers are now responsible for feeding the entire nation.

In a way, I was given a more important job than I had before the war.

Riana's territory is much larger than most countries. It produces food that stretches across continents.

As such, it was the second largest military presence after the Ecliptic, and Riana was one of the few beings authorized to call upon the Archmage in an emergency.

One is, of course, the Emperor, and Riana is the only person other than the Emperor who can call on Heriot in an emergency.

So all this talk about food is very important to her, but it's also the last thing she wants to hear.

There's a reason the Empire's massive food warehouses are located in the Grand Duchy of Saint-Tuan.

And there's a reason why Adelia is showing off her design drawings and Herriot is interested.

"But when the automated golems are finished, food production will explode, and we'll be able to supply the entire continent, which will reduce your burden, which is good for you, right?"

Herriot said, and Adelia nodded.

The technology to make golems for warfare is now shifting to production.

Create an automated machine for agriculture.

In fact, there are a lot of golems in the farming business, and they are now dreaming of full automation.

Thanks to the Duchy of St. Thuan's golem technology and Adelia's collaboration, the knowledge that once created the Titans will now be used for agriculture as well as mining, in part to gather useful things.

Of course, we all know that there's a certain, uncomfortable possibility that a small change to the production line could turn agricultural golems into fearsome war golems.

Depending on what you attach to the part, it can be used for production or destruction.

Riana narrows her eyes at the notion that it's all for your own good.

"Who says you can't do it at all?"

Riana's painted nails tremble, her painstakingly drawn eyebrows come together, and her red lips part.

"Let's not do it now."

"You guys know me....... You know how I usually am?"

"Do you think I'm sitting in some elegant salon or something, saying, "Rain, rain, rain, snow, snow, snow"?"

"I'm wearing suspenders, rummaging through manure bins, and staring at the rain all day when I need rain."

"I don't know why my crops are behind, so I spend all day asking farmers about it."

"The boars are eating the roots, the monsters have ruined the farming, the pests are rampant, soothe the depressed and take action, eh?"

"That I am."

"Not in a long time."

"I put on a dress, I put on makeup, I painted my nails, I was a little bit cocky. All the way to the palace, huh?"

"Do I have to hear about it again today?"

"Well, we can forget about that for today, and listen to it tomorrow......."

"You guys who've been holed up in your labs don't know me......."

"You guys who like to study don't know me......."

"Do you know how I feel about you guys talking about how it's good to be able to study......."

Adelia and Herriot actually say that.

They ask me why I don't like it when I can just do research. I don't consider it work in the first place.

"You don't know how much I want to play, you guys don't know......."

Eventually, my eyes go blank in confusion and I mumble to myself.

"Uh, yeah....... We can talk about this later at the mage meeting......."

Adelia and Herriot had noticed, too, and they turned to face Herriot and nodded.

In the end, only Cliff could drag Riana, now a super-sword, to the dance floor.

"Did you think she....... can dance?"

At Harriet's question, Adelia stares blankly as Kliffman dances with Riana.

"You know what? That one, that one, the polarity, it makes me dizzy sometimes."

It wasn't Adelia who answered, but Kaiir, who approached from a distance.

"Ah, Kaier."

It wasn't just Kaier Biorden.

A wheelchair with Kaier sitting in it. Behind him, a woman pushing it.

"It's been a while, Sister Adelia, and Archmage."

"Hello. Senior."

"It's been a while."

Behind Kaier was Redina.

About two years ago, Kaier Bioden woke up from a coma.



* * *



It was Redina who cared for Kaier, who had been in a coma since the war.

Naturally, being war heroes themselves, they were provided with support and periodic visits from a priest to check on Kaier's condition.

But Redina was always there.

In truth, Redina shouldn't have had to care for Kai so much.

But Redina stayed by his side for the entire three years he was in a coma.

We didn't know if Kaier would regain consciousness or not.

I stayed with Kaier, whose only heart was beating.

And then one day.

Kaier opened his eyes.

They've been together ever since.

I helped him rehabilitate and lived with him.

Perhaps, if his rehabilitation goes well, he'll regain his strength and get out of the wheelchair.

That's what Redina had been telling Kai all along.

-Brother, eat this.

-Sober is...... okay? I hope you don't drink, though.

-What do you want to eat?

-Want to take a walk?

Herriot and Adelia watched it go by.

It's miraculous that Kai'er regained consciousness, and they've both visited him from time to time to see how he's been taken care of by Redina.

And I think it's fair to say that the heavens were touched by Redina's care that Kai'er actually regained consciousness.

There is no such polarity.

"......."

"......."

If the polarity on the male side is Cliffman, the polarity on the female side is Redina.

It's nice that it's working out, but in the end, they both realize that it's a bitch.

After spending a while asking Kai if he was okay and if he needed anything, Redina took a breath when Kai said he was going to go talk to some friends for a while.

Redina looks at Harriet and smiles.

"By the way, I saw your book, Archmage."

"Oh....... Is that......?"

"Yes, the Book of Samurai. We're only up to the introduction, right?"

"Yes."

The magic that made Herriot an Archmage.

After the war, Herriot tried to organize his realizations in writing.

Redina is fast at doing magic, but she lacks absolute horsepower.

So if you can unlock the magic that Herriot has awakened, you can solve your own problems.

So I thought I'd try to understand Herriot's book, at least the introduction.

"Does anyone even understand that? I don't understand any of it, not even a little bit."

This is not a book for everyone, even wizards.

Like Adelia, Redina is a member of the Magical Society, so she has access to Herriot's book.

"Oh, yeah, right......."

"You won't be disappointed, in fact, I think that's why you should use it."

"Yeah. Honestly, I didn't understand....... at all."

But there's a reason why I can't help but say, "I have no idea what your book is about, so you can go ahead.

The council is reserved for the best of the best among mages. When its leader, Herriot, decided to put his greatest realizations into writing, everyone in the council objected.

It's too powerful a spell, and it shouldn't spread so easily.

So Herriot started by writing an introduction.

And to the people of the masquerade, let those who wish to see, see.

But neither Redina nor Adelia understood.

Other members of the council have had similar answers so far.

Herriot explains the magic she's come to realize.

But the wizards can't figure out why this is possible.

Some people don't understand how the magic works.

Even if you understand how the magic works, you may wonder if it's humanly possible.

The theory exists, and it works.

But it's a very simple conclusion that there's only one person in the world who can make it work: Herriot.

"So you can keep that spellbook, it's a spell that no one will ever use anyway."

No one will understand you anyway.

But great magic must be recorded for posterity.

So it would be significant to preserve the magic in a spellbook that no one else of the time could understand.

"By the way, you're not an Archmage for nothing, you're a spellcaster before you're thirty."

It's not even just magic, it's the greatest magic in the world.

Herriot couldn't help but blush at Redina's crass remark.

"By the way, I heard your sister Adelia is getting married soon, too?"

"Oh, that....... Yeah."

Soon, Adelia was to be married to the third son of the Grand Duke of St. Thuan.

Somewhere in the distance, the Grand Duke of Saint-Antoine, also a member of the cabal, was talking to someone, and the Grand Duke's three sons were also present.

"So we're family now?"

"Oh....... Well, is that......."

Harriet smirked as she watched Adelia blush and shake her head.
