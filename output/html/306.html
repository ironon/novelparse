            Episode 306.





As of Wednesday, my own participation in the festival was over.

As long as Riana is helping Kliffman and Ellen prepare for the contest, there's nothing I can do about it.

Today, Thursday, is the main round of the Unlimited Tournament. And tomorrow, Friday, we have the Miss & Mr. Temple contest and the finals of the Unlimited Tournament.

I had qualified for the unlimited tournament by winning the first-year tournament, but chose not to play.

I suppose it wouldn't be a bad idea to get some experience, but I'm not sure I'd want to risk injury, and I'm not sure I'd want to risk my health when I'm using a power boost.

My lighthearted first-year tournament turned into an unexpected struggle, and now with the Black Order and the Vampire Council, I don't know when I'll have to play for real. I couldn't push myself any harder in the tournament.

So there's not really a schedule to participate in.

The damned cross-dressing contest was canceled, and of course the Black Order thought I was a bastard with bad taste.

Herriot was in Group C of the main bracket of the Unlimited tournament.

Participants had to get to the stadium early to set up, so Herriot had to leave early.

Before we left, I had a chance to chat with Herriot for a bit.

"I don't know what to say, but....... Would that work?"

I feel bad saying this, but I don't even know how the hell Herriot made it through the qualifiers.

"I'll figure it out."

Herriot chirped, annoyed by my concern.

I've been nervous since the morning, so I've been asking her questions, and she doesn't seem overly confident, but she doesn't seem overly nervous either.

"Earrings?"

She wasn't even wearing her serenity enchanted earrings.

At my words, Harriet sighed.

"Artifacts are off limits, right?"

Was it?

Come to think of it, yes.

Granted, I'm a full-time artifact user at the point of Sarkhegar's Ring, but I didn't really check to see if I'd gotten the artifact.

That said, you'll have to fight with Herriot's easily-excited temper without anything to back it up.

"Anyway, don't force it. If you feel like you can't, just hit him. You won't get hurt, but you might, so be careful. Almost all of the finalists will be able to enchant, so think about that......."

"Hey, even my mom doesn't nag me this much!"

Eventually, Harriet squealed, and then looked at me with a sad smile.

"Are you that insecure about me?"

Was it supposed to look that way?

"Oh....... No. Not that......."

"No, I know, it's just the way it is. And the truth is, I'm not that offended that you're doing this."

Herriot sighs.

"I know you're just worried about me, thank you."

While it could have been hurtful to take the nagging as a sign that she didn't believe in herself, she chose to look at it positively.

"Still, I'm trying to be different."

I want to be strong.

It's a physical strength thing, but I was thinking before that it's a mindset thing.

Ellen was thinking that her mind was ready, but her body wasn't.

Herriot didn't think either was ready.

In the end, after many days and events, both Ellen and Harriet had changed. There was no single event that caused this, but rather a series of events that overlapped and accumulated to instill a desire to be strong.

To both Ellen and Harriet.

"That, I'll show you this time."

Herriot said it proudly. It was the first time I'd seen him smile in a long time, and he'd always seemed so serious and serious lately because of everything that's been going on.

"Is that something to look forward to?"

"No matter what you expect......."

Herriot chuckles.

"More than that?"

With those words, Herriot left.

It's hard to believe, but when Herriot said that no matter what you expect, you'll get more than you bargained for, I knew he wasn't lying.



* * *



I know of only two people who make it to an unlimited tournament.

One is Herriot de Saint-Ouen, who has just taken off for the stadium.

The other is, of course, Olivia Ranze.

When I said to Ellen that she was Miss Temple or that she could beat me in a no-limit tournament, it wasn't a taunt, it was because I actually played in both.

After Harriet left, I found myself at the front door of the dorm.

"Hmph, were you waiting for your sister?"

"Well. Right."

"I didn't think so. I'm surprised."

Olivia spotted me on her way out of the dorm, squinted, and smiled.

"By the way, senior, can't you use divine power?"

We know that Olivia is confident in her abilities. Although we don't know how much.

Still, Olivia's greatest asset is her divine power.

But of course, since she had renounced her faith, Olivia shouldn't be able to use divine power, regardless of whether or not she could. At my words, Olivia smiled.

"Right, because we can't fall prey to the Inquisition."

"Is ...... really that bad?"

"Unauthorized use of divine power is, of course, forbidden."

You're confident of winning the tournament without even using your long-term divine power? Of course, you've already proven yourself by making it to the main draw.

At my question, Olivia tilted her head and gave me a coy smile.

"Huh? Do you care?"

"......Well, you'll figure it out."

"Chet."

Olivia stuck her tongue out at me for almost feeling too good.

So confident, even when she can't use her most important ability. I wonder how good Olivia really is.

And I had one more question.

"I have a question."

"What is it?"

"Hey, I thought you didn't go to Miss Temple last year. And the tournament."

"You didn't have time last year because you were out serving, did you?"

"You said it was like that before, you weren't really interested."

"Oh, yeah. I did."

Olivia is not a person who likes to show off. Before this, she's always been humble, caring, and even took a year's leave of absence to do rear-guard duty in the Demon War.

Anyway, Olivia Ranze is not the kind of person who likes to show off, even though she has changed. She's never been to Miss Temple, she's never been to a tournament or anything like that.

"You want to know why I'm leaving all of a sudden?"

"Yes, it is."

You're constantly being urged to compete in Miss Temple or tournaments, so why are you suddenly competing in all of them?

"That....... It's not really that great......."

At my question, Olivia blushed and scratched her cheek with her finger.

How Olivia Lanchester, who was never interested in flaunting beauty or power, suddenly became interested in both.

Shyly, Olivia opens her mouth to speak.

"That....... money....... because......."

"Money?"

"Uh....... Yeah."

Money?

Someone who seems to be more indifferent to money than showmanship is competing for it? Olivia ahhhhs and laughs coolly.

What to say.

He looked a little silly and innocent.

It was the first time I'd seen a genuine expression on Olivia Ranze's face in a long time.

The first time we met, I felt like I was seeing the Olivia Ranze of old, when she complied with a rude first-year's unexpected request to meet face-to-face and talked to me in earnest.

"Well, I'm the one who got kicked out, not technically."

"......Ah. Yes."

"So....... I don't have any money, so now......."

a.

Was it?

As the daughter of a crusader knight commander, she may not have known anything else but that money was scarce.

But now that Revere Lance has been dismissed from the Crusader Order and his relationship with Olivia Lance has broken down, Olivia's been able to pull some strings to stay out of trouble, but now she's in trouble she can't tell anyone about.

He has no place to get his pocket money.

I needed money, so I started competing in tournaments with huge prize money and Miss Temple.

It was all about the money.

Olivia blushed, embarrassed to say the words.

Still, it's kind of cool.

"......Doesn't the dignity fee come from the template?"

Royal class students receive a monthly pocket money in the name of maintaining their dignity.

Four gold coins per month.

Four million dollars may seem like a small amount to some, but it's a lot of money.

On top of that, Olivia is someone who doesn't seem to have any interest in luxury. She doesn't wear any jewelry or accessories, and she doesn't have any expensive hobbies.

Isn't the dignity fee from the temple enough then?

"That....... Yeah, but......."

Olivia bit her lip slightly.

"This is really stupid and kind of. I thought you might be embarrassed, so I wasn't going to say it, but......."

Olivia eventually sighs heavily and looks at me in frustration.

"I have a nursery school that I've personally sponsored for a long time, but I gave up my faith, not the kids. I used to have a lot of pocket money from my ex-father-in-law, so it wasn't a problem, but even after this, I've had to cut back on my sponsorship. There are some places that don't have enough money......."

"......."

"So I'm running out of money, and I'm kind of stretched thin, so I'm going to......."

I could see why Olivia was reluctant to tell me.

She knows she's going to be told she's stupid.

It wasn't a place she could support with her own hard-earned money.

But even now, when money is tight, I can't cut back on my donations or quit, so I need the money for tournaments and Miss Temple that I wouldn't have otherwise been interested in.

In the end, it was all about the money, not about getting in Ellen's face for nothing.

Olivia's lips twitched, as if she were making an excuse.

"Well, at least I....... that bad?"

"What's that?"

"The money I get paid to play for places like Chanapelle is not the kind of money I would use to....... for a sponsorship, it's not like that."

I once asked Olivia why she couldn't live for herself.

I wonder if he thought I'd be upset if he told me the real reason he needed the money.

"Actually, I've been thinking about it, but I talked to you the other day and I think it's not the best idea....... I'm thinking about it, but it's okay."

No matter how you use the prize, it's yours to keep.

I'm guessing that the organizations she's supporting are not financially comfortable. We don't know how much Olivia's donations are, but if they're reduced, they're going to be affected.

When I said nothing. Olivia smiled weakly.

"After all, I'm an idiot......."

Olivia mumbles to herself in disbelief.

"I do think it's stupid."

"......."

Is it stupid to try to help others when you can't even help yourself?

I used to think so. I still do, to some extent.

"Still, can that be a bad thing?"

However, those who don't live that way have no reason to look down on those who do.

Be yourself.

There are just some people who live like Olivia.

I don't know and can't judge its rightness or wrongness.

At my words, Olivia looks at me with wide eyes, slightly surprised.

That's not a bad thing.

By no means did I say it was a good thing to do.

"Thanks, Reinhard."

But Olivia smiled as if she was being cheered on. I felt my breath catch in my throat whenever I saw Olivia's expression, not her usual fake one, but her genuine one.

"You are my strength. So much."

Olivia smiled sheepishly, stroked my hair, and winked at me.

"Sis, I'm going to win."

"I didn't mean to say ...... to win."

"......Don't beat around the bush if that's how you got it!"

Olivia scrambled and ran out of the dorm.

......That was a pretty big deal.

By the way, Olivia did not compete in the grade level tournament.

If the prize was money, I could have gone to a grade level tournament.

He thought it wasn't fair because his opponent would be a fifth grader, when in fact he was in school for one more year, and he wouldn't be able to play in the sixth grade tournament.

I think that's why I only played in unlimited tournaments.

As I watched Olivia walk away, I became a little more agitated.

Miss Temple, and unlimited tournaments.

Olivia said after both of their dominant wins.

And I'm pretty sure Herriot and Ellen would be at a disadvantage there.

So, aside from my personal feelings, I was psychologically rooting for Ellen and Harriet. They were fighting a losing battle.

But Olivia was entering both competitions not just for fun, but for something very serious to her.

Now it's hard to know who to root for.

But the nursery's funding is a problem.

This was a bit of a mystery to me.

That can't be right.......

"Oh, there."

After Olivia left, I was walking back to my dorm when someone called out to me.

I was a student, and as the lowest ranking member of the Royal Class, I couldn't possibly have a junior, so it had to be a senior.

"What?"

"You're Reinhardt, right?"

"Yes, by the way."

It was a senior woman with a good-looking face, who called me over, but she was looking off into the distance, not at me.

He was staring in the direction of Olivia's disappearance, to be precise.

"What did you and Olivia talk about?"

"......Well, it was just a small thing."

But who is this guy?

"...... is it?"

The senior in front of me started to glare at me.

I didn't see anything hostile in that gaze.

What to say.

I'm overcome by a strange feeling that sends chills down my spine. He's smiling at me, and I don't know what to say.



It's a weird feeling, like smiling isn't really smiling.

"So, who are you?"

"Oh, you didn't introduce yourself."

He held out his hand to me.

"It's Schmidt. Radia Schmidt. Sixth grade."

"......Ah, yeah."

I clasped her outstretched hand.

Despite its good looks, I felt it in my hands.

Not a normal person.

For some reason, I feel uncomfortable, so I stare at him.

"What can I do for you?"

"Oh, no, Reinhardt. Nothing to do."

He looked at me and gave me a coy smile.

"Not yet."

What is it?

Leaving me with a strangely creepy comment, the unnamed senior slowly walked away from me.
