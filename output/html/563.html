Louis Ankton's talent is academic.

They can't use magic, so they can't help in combat.

But he was still with the Allies, and I saw him again and again in the Royal Class garrison.

Louis Ankton is a sorcerer, a wizard who can't do magic. He actually helped design the Power Cartridge and Moonshine.

In the original, Louis helps the kids improve their magic level, and I'm sure that's what he's doing here.

Sorry Louie, but technically Louie is backwards compatible with Herriot.

But that's because we're comparing apples to apples, not that Louis is a bad boy.

While he can't actually use magic, he has the talent to fully understand and design all lines of magic.

There's a problem with starting there in the first place.

Louis Ankton had nothing to do with Adelia's project, Titan Research. But he would have been a great help.

Louis Ankton is not affiliated with the Titan project.

He may have been working on refining and improving the combat magic of the mages, but he's more than capable of handling the big stuff.

Still, Louis' lack of involvement in the development of Titan suggests that he was working on a completely different project.

Louis Ankton has a talent for understanding black magic, literally.

So if Anna is working on a project involving the undead, Louis Ankton could help her with it, or even lead it.

So, while we don't know for sure yet, we do know some things.

Anna is not eating and sleeping in a lab somewhere in this garrison.

There is no reason to conduct research related to black magic in this Allied garrison in the first place.

The temple will have a lot more facilities and will be easier to secure.

You're in the wrong place at the wrong time.

To learn the true nature of what the Empire does, you must go to the Temple, not here.

Is Anna really involved, and is Louis Ankton involved.

If she's involved, what the hell is she doing.

What you think is a death knell is likely to be very different from what you think it is, and you can't predict what it will be.

Do I really need to see that?

If so, how?



* * *



When I realized that Louis Ankton and Christina were gone, I realized that I was being lopsided.

I had assumed that the desolate atmosphere of the Royal Class garrison was due to the aftermath of the Battle of Serandia.

It's winter, it's cold, and there are a lot of people hanging out in the barracks.

But it wasn't that, it was the fact that there weren't many people there, giving it a lonely vibe.

The garrison won't be moving for the winter, and the monsters around it are less of a threat now that Serandia, a key monster spawning area, has been cleared.

Royal class members get special treatment, so they were being accommodating to those who wanted to return to the temple to spend the winter.

I've seen soldiers who seem to be on vacation in the ecliptic, and I can't imagine there are any in Royal Class.

If I knew one, I'd know ten, and if I knew one, I'd only know one.

We don't know if there's actually a relevant experiment going on in the temple.

But with Anna almost certainly back at the Temple, it's very likely that the experiment, if it's happening at all, is happening at the Temple and not at the Allied garrison.

The facilities and security are far superior at Temple, and there's no need for risky experiments in a snowy Allied garrison.

It's ridiculous.

If it's a vacation or a school break, it's normal to leave school.

This is the way it is, and the students would rather go back to school than take a vacation.

I finally get a proper look at the dingy Royal Class garrison.

What's going on.

How do we verify that?



* * *



Bertus was on the Yellow Planet.

Tetra, the emperor's office in the Imperial Palace.

Bertus starts reading the report.

For a moment, Bertus was speechless.

Saviolin Tana didn't speak either.

After a long silence, the Emperor spoke briefly.

"Lord Tana, if heavenly punishment is given to those who have sinned, what punishment should I receive?"

Terrible things.

I couldn't have said it better myself.

The greatest sinner in the world would be Bertus, for the sin of the one who ordered it would be greater than that of the one who did it himself.

God's punishment for such a person shouldn't end with the taking of their life.

Bertus wondered what punishment was worse than death.

"Your Majesty, all of this is for the future and well-being of humanity. You are making a decision for the good of humanity. You cannot call this a sin."

"Do you really think so?"

This was an overly exemplary answer.

"......."

Just because it's necessary doesn't mean it's not a sin.

Both Tana and Bertus knew it was just words to comfort the emperor.

That's why Tana had no answer to Bertus' overly direct question.

Because you can't block the sky with your palm.

"Well, there's no such thing as punishment, so I'm just saying."

If God watches over the world, why is there sin in the first place and why did the Gate debacle happen?

"When I think about it, it would be funny with or without the punishment."

"Funny......?"

"What kind of ridiculous joke is it when you give someone a trial they can't overcome without sin, and then judge them?"

"......."

"If there's no punishment and no reward, why did this have to happen in the first place, and what did the gods throw this into the world for?"

"......."

"Well, I don't really care about gods anymore. I'm starting to think so, though......."

Bertus clicked his tongue briefly.

"I apologize, Lord Tana. I must have gotten carried away. It's useless......."

Bertus washed his face a few times.

Retribution.

There is no such thing in the world.

Then why is there sin at all.

Who is responsible for the sin.

Who should bear the burden and who should be punished.

"By the way, do you have a handle on what's going on with the Crusaders?"

"......We don't know which groups are specifically involved, and the scene is beyond our ability to investigate."

Not long ago, Bertus had been informed of the destruction of a tomb of saints beneath the Crusaders' headquarters.

A cemetery has been destroyed and the remains stolen.

"It looks like Elion Bolton will be returning to the ecliptic soon."

"......Yes."

The work of the Crusaders is the work of the Crusaders.

Hoping this doesn't spark anything, Bertus looks at his tea, which is now cold.

"One of my classmates died, and another was crippled."

"Yes......."

Dead classmates.

And a crippled classmate.

"Ludwig, I don't know about you, but I thought stubbornness wasn't your thing."

"Yes, it is."

Saviolin Tana had watched Ludwig's swordplay when she was a dormitory warden for Charlotte's bodyguards.

Originally an excuse to watch Reinhardt's sword, Ludwig has long since grown accustomed to stumbling and falling and begging for instruction.

Similarly, Delphine had been looked at, but not specifically.

Delphine is dead and Ludwig has lost his arm.

Bertus, of course, knew everything about his classmates, if not in detail.

And Bertus was getting the full scoop on each of their performances, not only during the Temple years, but also during the Gate debacle.

Ludwig.

One of four classmates who awakened without ever learning to enchant.

Even though the comparison is between a warrior and a demon, Ludwig was unrivaled for someone his age.

It's a monster.

If it weren't for the war, he'd be in the master class in a few years.

"I know you're not the kind of guy to give up like that."

"Probably, yes."

And not just skill, but personality.

His best friend, Delphine, was dead, and he'd been picking dangerous battlefields throughout the Gate crisis, so he wasn't about to give up the fight just because he lost an arm.

Stubborn to the point of death.

Even without seeing it, Bertus knew what was coming.

To prevent the death of a classmate's dog.

Before the moth burns out.

"Tell them to return to the template."

Bertus issues an imperial decree.



* * *



There are some people in the world who don't need to be persuaded or convinced.

If you want someone to come, you tell them to come; if you want them to go, you tell them to go.

Bertus is such a thing.

This is how the world has come to be, and still is, at least in the land of men.

Torn between anger and despair, between fighting on and fighting on, between Klippmann's rants, his friends' persuasions, and his teacher's advice, Ludwig needed time to think.

"Ludwig, this is His Majesty's imperative to return to the Temple."

The Emperor's orders came from the mouth of Mr. Mustang.

"If we go to the warp spot and deliver these papers, we'll be able to return to the ecliptic."

"......."

Mr. Mustang gave me detailed instructions on where the warp spots were in the Allied garrison and who to look for.

It's a shame.

Longevity doesn't come by accident.

A direct order to return to the temple, even if he was a classmate, because he was wounded and would insist on fighting, shows how gentle the emperor is.

A royal class, even a crippled one, who didn't need to be bothered.

It's the right thing to do.

I don't need people to convince me, I don't need a reality check, I don't need Ludwig to accept it and go along with it.

Go back.

With those words, Bertus can force Ludwig's behavior, and Ludwig has no choice.

Dr. Mustang was also very impressed that Bertus, now Emperor, cared so much about Ludwig himself.

But when he saw Ludwig's stern expression, Mr. Mustang's face hardened.

"Ludwig, it's Huang Ming. It's not something you can refuse. You know that, don't you?"

An attitude of hesitation.

It's an imperial gesture.

You can't say no, even if you're going to get your head blown off.

Coercive consideration.

"Yes, sir. I know. Of course......."

Ludwig nodded steadily.

Mr. Mustang breathed a sigh of relief, because he hadn't expected Ludwig to yell at him.

Ludwig receives the document containing the Emperor's decree and stares at it in silence.

Ludwig knows that no matter how much he wants to leave this battlefield, he cannot refuse this order from the Emperor.

Now, really, I can't help it.

What you have to accept, you have to accept.

You have no place on this battlefield, and so many people care about you that they're trying to get you to leave.

You can't deny it anymore.

"Even if I go back to the ecliptic, there must be something I can do, right?"

"Well, I told you, there are plenty of places that need you. You have friends in the dorms now, so you won't be lonely."

Mr. Mustang thought Ludwig might be stubborn, so he smiled and nodded at Ludwig's comment.

No stubbornness, no obsession, no desire to fight.

His brief resolve and determination to kill the demon with his own hands is eventually broken by others.

Finally, with the Emperor's orders, Ludwig must leave the battlefield.



* * *



I didn't have to say a long goodbye.

The very next day.

Ludwig said a quick hello to his Royal Class sisters and brothers, packed up his things, and headed for the warp point.

Lanyon Sessor and Scarlett followed to see Ludwig off for the last time.

"You've got Christina, you've got Louis, you've got Anna, you've got Detomorian, so you're not going to be bored."

"I see."

"Take care, Ludwig."

"Thanks."

Ludwig lost his arm saving Scarlett's life, and Scarlett's expression is tinged with guilt as she realizes that it was her fault that Ludwig had to leave.

"Don't be sorry, Scarlett."

"Ludwig......."

The more Scarlett hears this, the more distressed she becomes.

You've decided to leave the battlefield.

So let's not get carried away.

As Mr. Mustang says, even in the ecliptic, Ludwig thinks he has a job to do.

Whatever it is, their work is not insignificant, and he believes he can do something about it, even if he can't fight in this war.

The Emperor's command is something to be thankful for, not something to be bitter and divisive about.

If I ever ran into the Emperor, I'd have to get down on my knees in gratitude.

Between people and transports returning to the ecliptic from the warp spot, the mages in charge of the warp begin casting Mass Teleport.

Beyond the boundaries of the warp spot, Ludwig gestures to his friends who remain on the battlefield.

"You have to be okay."

Death is a sad thing.

Wishing your friends well in distant eclipses is the only thing left to do now that news of the battlefield is out of reach.

That's a shame.

Ludwig leaves, knowing that there is no place for him now.

"Yes, Ludwig, too."

I will fight for your share, and I will survive to the end.

Scarlett told Ludwig so again and again, and Lanyon Sesor waved at him until the end of his long, long mass teleportation cast.

Mass teleportation casts take time.

It's not a spell that anyone can use, it's a way of transporting people and supplying people at the same time, so it's activated at certain times. And the warp spots were not the only ones in operation in the Allied garrison.

So until mass teleportation was activated from the warp spot, Ludwig could watch the supplies and people arriving on the ecliptic, one by one.

Ludwig hadn't been back to the ecliptic since his departure, so it was his first time at a warp spot like this.

But even Ludwig, who had never been to a warp spot before, couldn't help but notice that something was out of the ordinary.

"......Crusaders?

It wasn't just soldiers returning to the ecliptic for the winter, but paladins as well, gathered at the warp spot.

That's as far as it goes.

Paladins, however, were far more numerous than the others.

"Are we going to go all the way back to the graveyard?

And the leader of the Crusader Knights, Elayon Bolton.

Even Ludwig could recognize the faces of the heads of the big groups by now.

Ludwig couldn't help but feel strangely uncomfortable as he saw the seriousness in their expressions.

What happened.

That wasn't the end of it.

-Ellen......?

-Is Ellen going back, too?

-Yes, I'm just going to go back for a second.

In the distance, Ellen approached, causing Lanyon Sesor and Scarlett to look up when they spotted her.

Inevitably, everyone's eyes shifted to Ellen.

A warrior, Ellen Artorius, approaches the warp spot, dressed in plain clothes rather than her usual ceremonial armor.

In many ways, Ellen was an exception to the rule, allowing her to use as many warp spots as she pleased, with permission from Command.

But this isn't the same Ellen everyone is used to seeing.

You are holding something in your right hand.

-Hello!

-Buck!

-Ahhhhhhh!

In Ellen's right hand was an odd cage, with a black cat inside that appeared to be panicking, spinning in place and crying.

-I thought it would be safer to leave it in the ecliptic.

-Yes.

-Yes, that's right.

-Cat!

Ellen hugged the cage like it was precious, and the cat bounced around in its narrow confines, wide-eyed with panic.
