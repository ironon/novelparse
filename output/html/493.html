            Episode 493.





In a mountain village where night falls early, even the seasons come early.

When you're done with the ugly, earth-shattering, yet delicate, task of uprooting all the trees in a logged forest.

Early winter has arrived in the mountain village.

Time has passed.

Too much has passed.

In that mindset, all Reinhardt could do was do what he had to do.

I'd already gotten used to spending my days energized. Steps to make staying enchanted as natural as breathing.

Reinhardt had already gotten to the point where he could maintain his enchantment even when he was sleeping.

A state in which your enchantment is always present, even when you are not consciously aware of it.

Now that the work of uprooting the tree is done, turn the ground over and sift through the roots and debris, and Luna's work for the summer is done.

Not satisfied with that step, Reinhardt stuck his first shovel into the forest.

-Bam!

However, the shovel blade, made of iron, made an unpleasant clang as it hit the ground.

"......."

The winter that came early froze the ground.

-Chang!

Throwing down his shovel, Reinhardt picked up a pickaxe this time.

-Pak!

The downward thrust of the pickaxe didn't dig into the ground, it hit the ground.

Once again.

-Pak!

The pickaxe strikes the ground, hitting the exact same spot.

I don't know how many times I slammed it down like that.

-Puck!

He lifted his pickaxe, and the ground gave way.

"......."

As if possessed, Reinhardt searches the ground, picks out stones, and throws them.

As if there's nothing else you need to do.

As if I had forgotten about everything but this.

-Puck! Puck! billion!

Reinhardt slammed his pickaxe down like he was possessed, and a faint, blue smoke of magic wafted from his swing.

One day like that.

Two days.

One week.

Boom.

One month.

Naturally, the task of breaking, crushing, and digging through the increasingly frozen ground would become increasingly difficult as the winter progressed.

Digging and picking became breaking and crushing the frozen ground.

When it was snowing in the mountain village, Reinhard was in the forest.

Without using any holy objects, and without using the Flame of Fire.

As if faced with a destiny, Reinhardt would find himself in a forest during a heavy snowstorm, and even when the snow turned to ice, he would break the ice and break the ground.

"It's snowing too much, at least wait until it stops."

Watching Reinhard shovel and pickaxe into the bare earth, even in winter, the lesser Luna grabbed Reinhard by the shoulders and said, "I'm sorry.

"Uh....... When did you get here?"

Reinhard replied with a blank look, as if he hadn't even realized Luna was here.

We were in the midst of a foot-deep snowstorm, and Luna was covered in snow from head to toe.

But Luna was silenced by the sight of Reinhardt.

Reinhardt never got snow on his head or shoulders, even in heavy snow.

My overheated body was melting any snow that touched my head, face, and shoulders.

"No matter how many times I called him, he wouldn't answer."

"Oh....... Really?"

"Yeah. Do you realize how ridiculous you look right now?"

Luna covered her mouth and laughed at the sight of Reinhardt.

"What do you think?"

"It's like an angry pot calling the kettle black."

He looked like a boiling pot of water, his hair billowing out of his head.

"Rest today, I command you as the chief of Rizaira."

"It's ......."

At Luna's words, Reinhardt slung his pickaxe and shovel over his shoulder and walked along the slippery mountain path.

"Not the kind of thing to do in the winter, didn't you think?"

Luna, still walking ahead, says.

Reinhardt, of course, knew what he was talking about.

Naturally, picking the ground was not a winter activity.

It was the right thing to do at a time when the ground was thawing and seeds needed to be planted.

But as if on cue, Reinhardt had to do the hardest thing to do at the hardest time.

"That's why it's better."

Reinhardt says, strapping on his shovel and pickaxe and following Luna.

It meant that when things are easy, the rewards are easy, but there's a lot to be gained by doing the hard things at the hardest times.

"I'm glad you thought of that, I was worried you'd think I'd given you a tough job just to spite you."

"Isn't that ......?"

Reinhardt's words made Luna sigh heavily as she walked ahead.

"Yes, I know now that you're twisted in this way, but I can't say that I had any intention of harassing you. I admit that there was a part of me that wanted to give you some trouble."

"Surprisingly, I know my mom is a grumpy person in this way."

Luna narrowed her eyes at Reinhardt's attack on her, which sounded remarkably similar.

"...... You don't say a word."

"You don't have to lose, do you?"

"You're not supposed to talk to them."

Luna strode ahead, not wanting to deal with him anymore.

The snow was deep enough to make walking difficult, and it was still snowing heavily.

I don't know how long we walked through the snow, Luna says to Nazik.

"Aren't you worried about what's going on outside?"

At some point, Reinhardt became possessed and focused on what needed to be done, never mentioning the outside world.

So much so that it was almost like she had to ask.

"You told me to trust you."

"I did, apparently."

"If anything goes wrong, I'm going to blame it on my mom."

"......."

At Reinhardt's sudden rant, Luna stops walking and looks back at him.

Luna's eyes narrowed as she looked at Reinhardt.

"How did you get peace of mind, but with that same old mindset, that if anything goes wrong, it's all my fault?"

"If I go to Moro, I'm just going to go the way I'm supposed to go, right? I'm just going to think that way because it makes me feel better."

"Hah......."

"If this goes badly, I'm going to blame you for the rest of my life, and you know it."

"You've been in Rizaira a long time, judging by your behavior."

Reinhardt chuckled at Luna's comment.

"It's been a long time."

Reinhardt sees snow on tree branches falling into stormwater.

I stayed in Rizaira until the seasons changed twice.

"I'd like something hot for dinner tonight."

"You must have gotten too used to it, because ...... is getting cheekier and cheekier."

-Bam!

"Eek!"

True to Reinhardt's words, Luna's tongue lolled and kicked after being fed honey chestnuts.

"Don't get too comfortable with Lizaira."

Luna adds, walking still.

"You have to leave sometime, don't you?"

You need to leave.

Reinhardt's expression hardened at Luna's line-drawing words.

We must leave Rizaira as soon as possible.

However, I realize that there's a part of me that doesn't want to leave Rizaira.

Luna's words just made me realize something.



* * *



I don't know much about rural life, but I've learned that in the winter in mountain villages, just as the land freezes, so do the people.

So it's no exaggeration to say that in a place with four seasons, life in a mountain village is all about surviving winter, the season when everything freezes.

The whole act of making preserves and storing grain is more of a preparation to get through the winter when food is not available.

This is why residents are less active during this time.

It's not like there's anyone out there who's gritting their teeth like they're obsessed with something, like I am.

Winter was both a long break and an impatient time, waiting for it to be over.

Of course, Rizaira is no ordinary rural area, and the people are very strong, so food was never a problem.

Firewood for the winter?

I got enough done this summer to last me until next year.

The town's firewood shed has a huge pile of firewood that I've chopped and the townspeople have dried.

People light fires with last season's firewood, nibble at their stockpiles of food, and wait for the thawing ground to thaw and a new spring to arrive.

But now it was snowing heavily, and people were shoveling snow.

"Go up to the roof in a bit and clear some snow."

"You told me to take a break."

"......."

No.

That's right!

You told me to take a break, and now you want me to work as soon as I get back?

Luna's mouth begins to twitch.

Look at this.

This.

See, I'm trying to pout because I honestly have nothing to say.

"Yes, rest. If the roof collapses from too much snow overnight, you, sleeping on the second floor, will be the one hurt the most."

"You know what, mom? You know how you've been pretending to be someone you're not?"

"Whatever. I know."

I'm the most cringe-worthy of all because I'm the one who casually says I know.

"I used to think you and Ellen were the most alike in face, but do you know you're more alike in personality?"

"......Personality?"

At my words, Luna tilted her head as if she'd never heard of it before.

"Yeah. And then there's the pouting when you run out of things to say, and then there's the sneaky things you say."

"I hate to admit it, but based on your usual demeanor, you might as well be insulting your mother-in-law and your wife at the same time. What a son-in-law you are."

"This is what it's like to pout like this."

"Yeah, you have a knack for pissing people off, but you're wrong, so let's not talk about it."

The casualness of this conversation reminds me that I've been at Lizaira for a long time.

We walked along a path where people had cleared the snow. It was still snowing, so the accumulated snow would have to be cleared again and again.

When will this snowstorm stop.

"Do they really look alike?"

Luna said out of the blue.

"Yeah, they look alike."

I don't think people will notice the resemblance.

Maybe he was thinking of the comment about having similar personalities.

From the look on Luna's face, it was nice to be told she looked like Ellen, and she smiled.

"It's not exactly a mystery that parents and children look alike, is it?"

"Hmmm. I guess."

Luna continues to laugh.

"But that's what makes it all the more mysterious, isn't it?"

"That a being that is like me, that resembles me, but is never me, can come from me."

"That which comes from me, but cannot be me, is born and lives."

"How beautiful."

"Sometimes, I find it so mysterious, so lovely."

I didn't quite understand what Luna was saying.

Maybe it's because I don't have kids, or maybe Luna is on a whole other level of thinking.

"Why do you like Ellen?"

It was an abrupt question.

I don't know what it has to do with the snow, but Luna and I have been talking more than usual today.

Why I love Ellen.

It's been in Rizaira for quite some time, but it's something she's never brought up until now.

I've been avoiding the topic because I know I'll have to confront Ellen at some point, and that includes Ronan, her father.

Why do you like Ellen.

I thought about it for a long time, and sometimes I think about it alone, but there was only one thing I could say.

"......I'm not sure."

I can't honestly say that there was one moment or one event that made it happen.

I don't know.

I don't really know what to say other than that it just happened at some point.

"That's a satisfactory answer."

"I'm not sure if that's a good answer, but I'm glad you like it."

"I mean, we've spent so much time together, I can't really explain it."

"Is that....... is that how it works?"

"Whatever."

Luna smiles and walks away.

What's next, what's happening, what's going on.

It's not enough to have a good past without a good future.

-Woah!

-Save me!

People were busy shoveling snow, but the kids who didn't know any better were building snowmen, throwing snowballs, and just having fun.

Snowball fight.

And a snowman.

Then something occurred to me.

"I once built a snowman with Ellen."

"...... is it?"

"Not a snowman, but a human-shaped snow sculpture that looks too much like a person....... I made something that looked like a human eye and asked what it was, and he said he and his brother made them all the time."

"Haha, yeah, we used to do that because we were both unusually dexterous."

Luna laughed as she remembered a memory from long ago.

It wasn't until after I spat out the words that I realized I hadn't even put Lagan Artorius in my mouth.

"Arta and Lena did it too. Lena gave up because she couldn't do it, and Arta stayed up all night trying to make a snowman that was better than Ellen's, and she got a bad cold....... So that's when Ragan helped Arta build the snowman....... Yeah....... That's the kind of thing......."

Luna says, still smiling.

"There was a time when....... there was......."

His voice was wistful, as if he was recalling a long-ago memory, feeling both sadness and joy at the same time.

"I'm sorry."

At my words, Luna looks back at me.

"It brought back fond memories, why should I feel bad about that?"

Luna walks still.

"Thank you, Reinhard."

There was something about Luna that made me feel like she had been accepted into the family at some point.

We don't know when, or even if, that happened.

But at some point, it just became that way.

Like I don't know that moment of clarity.

Luna didn't know that.

What if Ellen were here.

I wish I had.

It's a snowy winter day.

I imagined a picture that couldn't exist, and I couldn't help but smile bitterly.
