            Episode 605.





I've gotten used to people who don't know me hating me, hating me. I thought it was inevitable.

But this time it's the opposite.

People who didn't know me were worshipping and loving me. Even within the Order of the Five Great Houses.

Just as Ellen is hailed as a warrior, they see me as the rightful champion of Als and Tuan, even if I don't have the world's recognition.

Quite a few people have seen me make my closing arguments.

Those who belonged to the Five Great Houses were high-ranking clerics and paladins of the Order, and they knew that the Gate was caused by my men, but apart from that, they knew that I did not wish it.

It was inevitable, then, that I would develop some supporters within the church.

Rowen was a radical among them.

In the first place, if there are radicals, there are moderates.

If you're a moderate who believes the devil had his reasons.

The radical is the one who says the devil is absolutely right.

That's assuming they both support me in the first place.

Does that mean that at some point, the majority of the higher-ups support me?

The popes didn't betray humanity, they just went with the flow?

Suffice it to say that even Elion Bolton, who was busy on the battlefield, is no stranger to this.

The Five Great Houses had been waiting for me to show up, and they had been my de facto supporters for some time.

"The radicals' claim that....... what?"

"It's not you, it's the empire and humanity that caused all this."

Those who didn't believe in me.

Is the argument that I'm responsible for all the people who didn't trust me, assuming I'm not at fault?

"Some of them, they want the empire to collapse."

In the end, it's the same thing.

Hold someone accountable.

It's just that it's not me.

Rowen was a believer in me.

And he was an empire-hater.

He tried to investigate the Empire's corruption, but the Crusaders stopped him and even tried to kill him.

"Rowen would have hated me, beyond the Empire, for not allowing him to reveal his corruption......."

Fire.

I was going to show the spectacle to someone.

I wanted an unspecified number of people to see it.

"You must now hate and distrust me and the Church."

Radicals are those who believe that empire is not only responsible, but humanity is also responsible.

That would mean that the Five Great Houses of God could never be clean. There would have been paladins, priests, and popes in their place.

What if we told you that the temples of the ill-regarded Tuan Cult were capturing, killing, and torturing civilians?

Otherwise, the abomination would have gone mad.

And the empire wouldn't be sleeping.

Without people, there would be no empire, and the empire would have to fall to the sword of the Five Great Houses.

"If we almost had a civil war in the ecliptic....... Is that too much of a stretch?"

At my words, Elion Bolton nods.

"Not necessarily, but it would have been a possibility."

From the beginning, Rowen was an Imperial Responsibilityist who went beyond investigating the case and basically held the Empire responsible for everything.

Elion Bolton would have seen Rowen as dangerous and would have wanted to eliminate him. Rowen would have wanted to bring down the empire if he had the chance.

As such, it was probably in the Crusader leader's best interest to purge Rowen. Left unchecked, the friction between the Order and the Empire could have turned into real bloodshed. Rowen was the kind of person who would rather detonate a bomb than avoid it, so it's not hard to see why Elayon Bolton's decision made sense.

If you leave Rowen alone, you do something dangerous.

So the fact that he tried and failed to do so would have made Rowen even more dangerous.

It's strange to hope that Rowen will stay sane after the Order he's been loyal to his entire life has tried to take his head.

That's what Elion Bolton means when he says you need me.

Rowen considers me a prophet, which means that when I meet with him, everything is solved.

We need to find Rowen.

Before you do something I don't want you to do, in the name of doing it for me.

Bertus led Ellen and the others to the underground laboratories of the Temple College of Magic.

It was a horrible sight.

Everyone watched what was happening underground.

Reanimated corpse, reanimating corpse.

Where they are now, what they're doing, and how they're going to be electrified.

Ellen, Ludwig, Louise, and Heinrich could all see what the demon had seen the other day.

Everyone was speechless.

Not just warriors, but heroes from the past who are long dead.

Saw it.

"Like I said, I have no intention of scrapping this plan, no matter what you guys say."

Bertus eventually told me everything, and then nailed me to the wall that he was going to do what he said he was going to do.

"So if someone dies in the future, you're going to keep bringing them back this way?"

Ellen asks, and Bertus nods.

That means a lot of things.

Even if Ellen dies.

This means that if Saviolin Tana dies, we will bring her back to life and send her into battle.

This shouldn't be happening.

But at the end of the day, what is a corpse worth other than its weight in gold?

If you can use something like that, you should, right?

"Ashardo....... This is how you brought him back?"

Looks nothing like a living person.

If you can come back to life and speak and remember the same way you did when you were alive, then you're really alive.

At Ludwig's question, Bertus shook his head.

"Failed."

"You can't really bring back....... never happened......?"

"Yeah."

This is a half-hearted resurrection.

It can't be about electrification, it's about making weapons.

Delphine can't even find the body, so she can't even try.

What if you could really bring the dead back to life, not just in one piece, but with their memories intact.

A half-hearted resurrection, the mere fact that it was even halfway successful, leads to false hope.

Louis Ankton, Anna De Guerna, and Christina.

These three were the core of the study.

Ludwig says still.

"I want to see it."

"You better not look at ......."

As the Dettomorian said, find the ashram and you will know everything.

But we haven't reached Asher yet.

"If it failed, how did it fail......."

I have yet to see it in its full glory.

"I think you should see......."

Bertus looked at Ellen and Heinrich, who seemed to be of the same mind as Ludwig, and sighed deeply.

Not everyone needs to be away as much as they did when the devil came, so all four of them stayed and watched the wizards go about their business.

You can't tell if they're an alchemist or a warlock by their outfit.

But they were doing what they had to do with a straight face.

If one evil wizard builds a dungeon and does horrible experiments in it, then if you do this on a national scale, you have hundreds of wizards doing horrible things.

An isolated area in an underground lab.

There, they were able to put a face to a name.

Christina.

Anna De Guerna.

Louis Ankton.

"You guys....... how......?"

Louis Ancton froze in his tracks at the sudden arrival of the Emperor, and Christina and Anna were equally surprised.

But I shouldn't have been surprised to see it in an unexpected place.

There was only one port in the quarantine zone.

"Is this Ashar......?"

Ludwig was looking at something in that port with a frozen expression.

The other bodies had been returned to life as if they were taxidermy, but with what could only be called a grotesque mass of flesh.

Ellen paled, Heinrich did the same, and Louise looked away with her mouth covered.

"What is this....... What is this....... This can't be Ashur. This is....... What did this do? What......."

Anna and Christina are both a bit taken aback by the sudden appearance of these people.

I realized that Bertus had granted me access, and I realized what was going on.

She always had an upbeat attitude.

But as if it were all a mask, inside the lab, he shook his head stoically.

"It just hasn't worked yet."

"What......?"

"There are still a lot of things we can try. I was able to talk a while ago. I was just doing what I was told, but apparently....... I could."

Anna and Louis were biting their lips at Christina's attitude.

I tried to revive my friend.

But it failed.

However, there are those who refuse to admit failure.

Something that's inside a port, but doesn't look like anything more than a trace of something.

Everyone sees it and calls it a failure, but there are those who still see the possibilities.

"Nothing is impossible."

It was possible to raise the dead halfway.

She asked why it was impossible to bring it back to life completely, and she believed she could do it.

Flimsy possibilities lead people to despair and false hope.

She lost her cool, mesmerized by the possibilities.

"If you're going to talk about failure, get out."

Inside the lab, Christina was a completely different person than she was outside. Faced with the possibility that she might be able to reverse her friend's death, she continued to touch Ashir's body.

After that failed, I tried a different approach, once again.

If that fails, another way.

Next.

You try dozens and dozens of times, thinking that one day you'll bring your dead friend back to life.

The result of all those attempts was this bizarre, chimerical mass.

Still, she had no intention of giving up.

Anna and Louis had already accepted failure, but Christina had not.

Ellen stares at the port with a stony expression.

It's an impossible task, but let's say you succeed.

Suppose you could bring the dead back to life.

If so, is there a place in the world for such a thing?

Ellen couldn't judge until then.

However.

I could tell that Christina, who had seemed fine in the garrison, had been broken long ago.

If you find yourself dead before the gate crisis is over, you may find yourself like this.

That you can fight even when you're dead.

That you can be a force for good, even after you've paid for your sins in death.

Should we be grateful for that, or despair?

But I never wanted to be a pile of flesh that didn't help anyone.

Ellen couldn't bear to see Christina in the midst of this horrible scene, desperately searching for hope where none existed.

"This is....... This is......."

There's something wrong with that.

Maybe I shouldn't be doing this.

In the end, there is only pain and despair for the living and the dead.

Already, Ellen could tell just by looking at her that Anna and Louis were reluctantly there, not to help with the research, but to shut Christina up.

Bertus tried to stop her, but he knew he couldn't.

It should stop.

It's only going to get crazier.

Find Ashur.

We find Ashur, but it's only a trail.

"Stop....... This is......."

Ellen says what everyone in the room wants to say.

Ellen pauses for a moment, and when she finally gets the words out, Christina turns and stares at her.

"Why?"

When Christina asks her to explain, Ellen stares at her.

"You know it won't work....... It's only going to make it harder on you......."

Ellen could already see the despair in Christina's abysmal, dark eyes.

This is not the look in the eyes of someone who is truly looking for hope.

This is not the look of someone who actually believes it's possible.

I couldn't resist, just in case.

You can't have the mechanical look of someone who is just hanging on because it's all they can do.

Even if it succeeds.

If you speak like Asher, and have Asher's memories, can you really say that you're alive?

But if you fumble with the memory, if you can say.

That's when it becomes something you really shouldn't do.

She was about to do just that.

Everyone is silent, but they agree with Ellen.

The fact that Anna and Louis, who must have been watching the whole time, were shaking their heads in sadness was proof enough.

You want her to stop, but you can't tell her to stop, so you're reluctantly helping her.

That stubbornness was destroying Christina and the other two in real time.

At Ellen's words that it's time to stop, Christina's abysmally deep eyes darken even more.

"You."

"This one here."

"Even if it was Reinhardt."

"Are you going to say that?"

On that note.

"......what?"

The mere mention of the name froze the air.
