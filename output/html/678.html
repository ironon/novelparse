The list of things to say to the Allied General Headquarters wasn't long.

Withdraw all allied forces and send them home to focus on rebuilding.

Effective dominance is not immediately possible or meaningful.

This is after they have become self-sufficient and self-sustaining on their own land.

For now, it's better to break up the coalition and let them scatter, so they can neither come together nor fall apart without our strength.

The fact that I have decided to dominate you does not bring actual domination.

The list of things to do gets longer, not shorter, as you solve them.

After ordering the Allies to prepare to withdraw, I left it all to Rowen, Louise, and Harriet for now.

The rest of us had more pressing problems to solve.

An empty imperial palace.

We need to fill in the gaps in the ecliptic as quickly as possible.

With no battles scheduled, there were only three of us at the palace: me, Charlotte, and Olivia.

As if the palace guards knew we were ducks, they naturally cleared the way when I showed up.

I couldn't see the expressions on the faces of the guards in their helmets.

However, they were fully prepared to enter the palace bloodlessly.

By Bertus, of course.

The palace was nearly empty, save for the guards guarding the entrance.

As the palace's defense, the magical barrier didn't really need people in the first place.

But the most important people were still there.

"You're back, Empress."

"I can't call it that anymore, but yeah. I'm back."

Chamberlain.

The person in charge of all the administration inside the imperial palace.

While he wasn't one to go out and about, he stayed behind to run the palace.



* * *



All I had to do was step into an empty palace and it was mine.

To be clear, this is not my job from here on out, it's Charlotte's job.

Charlotte would naturally know the inner workings of the palace and would be up to speed on its operations.

So I didn't have to do much.

So Olivia and I walked through the Tetra, the central imperial palace of Imperatos.

The central palace was solemn, serene, and huge.

Olivia looks up at the soaring ceiling of the Central Palace.

"Something....... doesn't feel right."

"Sure."

I ran to the end of the war.

But what happened after the war was so continuous that I wondered if I was dreaming.

All I could think about was getting here safely, and I didn't know what to do next.

The Emperor's palace, once untouchable, is now mine.

But I wasn't happy at all.

"I'm so....... Is it because I'm too small?"

Olivia looked at the enormous palace and felt more overwhelmed than fulfilled.

"Me too."

The palace is huge, but the world is nothing compared to it.

Our words make the world go round, and a single mistake is irreversible.

It will be torn apart, it will be merged, and sometimes it will be disputed.

Just as I'm a centerpiece, Olivia is a giant centerpiece.

It is charged with the enormous task of unifying and reforming all believers in the Five Great Gods.

So there was a lot of pressure on me and Olivia.

"Still....... We got here somehow."

Olivia holds still and hugs me.

"I can't lie and say it's all going to be happy."

"It's ......."

"Still, let's trust that we can do it. We've done it before, and we'll do it again."

After rejecting religion, she is forced to return to the path she left and do what she least wanted to do.

It's all because I wanted it for her.

I was always on the receiving end.

I'm still giving it away.

"Thank you, always."

There was no reason not to thank her, so I hugged Olivia fiercely.

Like I'm shaking a little bit.

Olivia, hugging me, was also clearly shaking.

You still have to trust that it will work out.

Just as feeling defeated doesn't necessarily mean losing.

A hopeless vision will only bring despair.

You have to trust that it will work out.

How much time has passed.

At the summons of the servants, Olivia and I made our way to the Emperor's office. Charlotte cleared the papers from her desk and placed them neatly to her right.

"All you have to do is come and sit down."

"...... Is that it?"

"Yes."

While Charlotte knew most of the details, Bertus left with a clear handoff.

"I think most of the key bureaucrats knew what was going to happen. We're just going to call them back and let them do their jobs. Of course, there are some who run scared, but in those cases, we have a plan in place as far as who to name as their successor."

National politics is not a vacuum.

Bertus had already made arrangements to ensure that the status quo would be maintained when I arrived.

"That doesn't mean it's all good, though, because there's still absolute starvation, there's still a lot of backlash against the Empire, and there's still a lot of opposition and rioting that's going to happen when you're crowned, and that's not something that Bertus can do anything about. We're going to have to take care of ourselves."

The war was dragging on and people were getting tired.

You can take over an empire.

However, an empire on the verge of collapse has immeasurable problems.

We're not drinking from a poisoned chalice, we're drinking from the poison itself.

Taking over an empire isn't always easy.

I inherited a sandcastle that was on the verge of collapse.

The bureaucrats remain, so you can run your empire through them, but the challenge of normalizing the situation in the ecliptic remains.

Once we stabilize the ecliptic, is that it?

Beyond the ecliptic, there is the matter of imperial territories and empires.

It will be necessary to gain their complete submission, and to begin to aid them in their self-reproduction.

"The good news is that when the Allies pull out, we'll be able to spend our military resources on the ecliptic, which would have meant another year or so of this, so it's a good thing out of a bad thing."

The rapid withdrawal of allied forces results in the conservation of resources.

For us, and for the rest of the world, Herriot's presence is a huge help.

Indeed, Herriot became the greatest wizard of all time, molding not only humanity but all races.

Charlotte stares blankly out the window after she says that.

I can only imagine what you're thinking.

You're probably thinking about the missing Bertus.

With everything ready to go, Bertus disappeared.

No, it ran away.

But neither Charlotte nor I thought Bertus would run away.

Somehow, I don't think that's what he had in mind.

"I rather like it. The people will hate the fugitive emperor, and it will make it easier for the Gradias imperial family."

If the emperor had been executed, there might be some who believed in the emperor's injustice.

But the emperor's escape would mean the end of the last thing he had left.

So Charlotte will think that Bertus got away, and that she's lucky to be alive. Just like I'm thinking that right now.

But neither Charlotte nor I were sure if Bertus had really thought that and run away.

"Christina, Louis, and Anna are unaccounted for. I don't think we'll ever find them. We'll have to see what happened to them, but the infrastructure for making Immortals was destroyed, and we'll never be able to rebuild that on an individual level, but you never know with people."

We need to find out if Christina is really dead, and if so, if the other two are too.

You can't say you're not a hot root, either.

And what happened to Ludwig.

Plus the problem of Antirrhinus.

It's not all over yet, and I don't know everything.

There's more and more to do, and more and more to keep up with.



* * *



It's been two weeks since the Battle of Diane.

In the meantime, Charlotte took over the administration of the Zodiac.

The Allies slowly began to make a comeback under Herriot's leadership.

As soon as they return, the story will spread across the continent that the gate incident ended in a Union victory.

And stories of imperial treachery and demons will spread.

The rest of the chaos that will ensue will be left to people everywhere to sort out.

Conflicting claims will ensue between those who reject me and those who have seen me in action in the Alliance, and it will cause countless conflicts across the continent.

You can't be everywhere at once.

May the leaders of mankind do what they say they will do.

I don't know what else to say, just that you guys have fun and live well.

It's the next one that really controls them.

For the time being, it was hard enough to keep up with the ecliptic.

After the Allied withdrawal, the complete end of the Gate Crisis was announced to the ecliptic.

All troops returned to the ecliptic.

And.

At the same time, the story of the devil devouring the empire will be spreading.

A joy so great that it drowns out all the confusion.

And, a bizarre story that will suddenly make that joy seem bizarre.

Imperial betrayal and demonic domination.

It's a story that's bound to be told at some point.

The blackout begins.

The Gate was actually caused by the Emperor, and the Devil has been trying to protect humanity.

That pretty much sums it up.

The Great Hall of the Central Palace Tetra.

b.

Herriot.

Charlotte.

Olivia.

Airi summoned from the Edina Archipelago.

Riana.

Sarkegar.

Four Lord Vampires, excluding Antirrhinus.

There's Rowen, the Crusader Knightmaster.

And Louise von Schwarz.

Here were all the people who were about to take over the reins of my regime, so to speak.

I wish the Grand Duke of St. Thuan could be here, but he has returned to his duchy with his army. leaving his daughter in charge of everything.

"......I honestly don't believe it even if I did."

Everyone in the room nodded slowly at my words.

Black propaganda.

Honestly, it was a little too obvious.

It is nothing more or less than the new regime badmouthing the old regime to justify its rule.

"I mean, why not?"

I nodded at Olivia's words. Whether people believe in it or not, it's good for me to have a few more people believe in it.

"Let the words of those who have seen you fight in the Union Army be your witness."

Black propaganda that doesn't make sense.

Actual veterans can attest to that.

I agree with Charlotte that that will get you some traction, and that's enough.

Charlotte begins to explain.

"What's happening on the continents is out of our hands, and our first goal will be to keep the entire ecliptic afloat and stabilized."

"Perhaps many of the forces that went home will have a different mindset over time."

"Many of them may be unwilling to accept our domination now that we're about to start functioning as an empire, and that may be the position of the rulers, or it may be the result of representing the position of the ruled."

"But there isn't a single power on the entire continent that can invade the ecliptic by force, so while they may be able to resist our rule, they'll never pose a real threat to us."

"It's going to be hard to get the political legitimacy, but if you subordinate them, obedience is bound to follow."

"It doesn't have to be power to make us dependent, it can come from the power we have or the resources we have or the technology we have."

"In the long run, we need to subjugate entire continents to the Empire, not politically or militarily, but economically. Once we're full, we create a situation where the moment they refuse to recognize our dominance, it's all over."

"Everyone may hate us, but we can dominate them if we make them realize that without us, everything they have is gone."

"Luckily, we have the blueprints for the new warp gate."

Charlotte looked at Harriet as she said it, and Harriet nodded.

New warp gate.

That's the second button on our way to dominating the entire continent.

"The primary goal is to stabilize the ecliptic."

"Then, restore and redesign the warp gates around the continent to unite the continent economically. Once we have control of the warp gates, no one can oppose us."

You can live a comfortable life in exchange for miserable submission to the devil.

So subjugate them economically rather than militarily.

Eventually, economic prosperity will speed up the rebuilding of civilization.

The moment we have a warp gate, we have the leash of an entire continent in our hands, just by being in control of it.

We talked briefly about where we need to go from here.

"We may actually have to use force. We're running low on food, and we've got Edina's problem to worry about, so I suggest you stay at the palace for now. You never know when or where you'll need it."

The ecliptic is a boiling cauldron right now.

An emergency can strike at any time, so we need to stay in the ecliptic for now.
