Saviolin Tana gave us a brief introduction to Larken Simonstein.

Larken Simonsteidt was the director of Chanapelle when Saviolin Tana, now quite old, was a rookie.

Like Saviolin Tana now, he held the title of the strongest swordsman on the continent. Larken Simonsteidt taught Saviolin Tana many things to help her become the next Schanapelle.

After grueling training that forced even her prodigy to unlearn everything she had learned at the Temple, she was able to rise to the rank of Knight Captain of Shanapelle's 1st Company.

Larken Simonsteid was already over eighty years old when Saviolin Tana was a rookie. Like Savior Tana, he was well past the age of retirement, though his training and manipulation of magic had slowed his aging.

So once he had trained the next generation and Xavier Tana's skills were well established, he passed the torch to someone else and retired.

It was nothing out of the ordinary, so everyone assumed he would retire and live out the rest of his days quietly.

As the stakes of the Demon War grew higher and higher, the Empire needed strength, and it turned to a retired Grandmaster.

But.

In a completely unexpected turn of events, Larken Simonsteid became King of the Demon Army, carrying the prestigious title of the first King of the Four Thousand.

I had no idea about the Four Heavenly Kings, but one of them is human, and he's even a teacher to Savior Tana.

In the original, even the dead demons are rarely mentioned, so there was no reason to mention the Four Heavenly Kings. Even when I was living here, I would occasionally talk about the devil, but never about the Four Heavenly Kings.

So it was a bizarre situation where I was the only one who didn't know what everyone else knew.

"Why he became the Four Thousand King of the Darklands can be found at......."

"I don't know."

Saviolin Tana shook her head.

"We'll never know."

I had established that she was a character who felt guilty for not being able to participate in the Great Demon War. But there was a backstory I didn't know.

Why did Larken Simonstein betray humanity and side with the Darklands?

I wonder if Sarkhegar, Loyaar, or Eleris would know?

I didn't ask the questions about the Four Heavenly Kings because I wasn't curious about them in the first place, but now that I've heard them, I'm curious about the stories about the Four Heavenly Kings that don't exist in the world.

Still, if he was given the title of First Lord of the Four Heavens and Airi was taught swordsmanship, it seems like he was treated well in the Darklands.

Saviolin Tana had many questions for Larken about his betrayal of the Empire and humanity, but in the end, her duty to the Empire prevented her from traveling to Darklands.

So it was bittersweet to arrive at the Demon King's Castle only now that it was all over.

We walked further, and eventually reached our destination.

The center of the demon castle.

A vacant lot that's been abandoned.

It must have rained and snowed long after the battle was over, but the scars of the battle were not easily erased by the overwhelming force of the fighting.

"This is where humanity won its final victory."

The site of a battle between a demon and a hero.

All the columns and statues were destroyed, and the ground was caved in.

Despite being a very large space, there were signs of heavy fighting everywhere, and the walls of the surrounding demon palace had been blown away or collapsed, as if something had torn them apart.

"......It's an unbelievable sight to see two beings fighting."

Even Saviolin Tana, the world's strongest player at this point, seemed to have had enough.

"Over and over again. Just how powerful the demon was....... I have no idea, and neither does the strength of Artorius against him......."

We walked out into the middle of the clearing.

"I can't believe Ragan Artorius was....... I can't believe it."

Saviolin Tana seemed shocked in a different way.

No matter how great Lagan Artorius was, he was no more than thirty years old.

Even with a strong team, he had killed a retired grandmaster and defeated a demon. Saviolin Tana was beginning to wonder if that was even possible.

"Due to the nature of the fight, the demon's body could not be found, but Artorius was found on the spot with his Alsbringer plugged into the ground, seemingly asleep....... was found."

I didn't see this fight, and I didn't describe it, but I know the truth.

The Four Thousand Kings may not know it, but it wasn't Lagan Artorius' strength that brought down the demon.

It was the power of Alsbringer.

No one knows what Alsbringer is really for except me.

Als, the War God.

Als Bringer.

It is, quite literally, a sword that can summon a war god.

It was Lagan Artorius, the incarnation of Als, who fought the demon in the first place.

The price is life.

Artorius killed the demon in exchange for his own life.

Ludwig becomes master of Alsbringer.

In the original story, Ludwig eventually used the true power of Alsbringer.

So.......

As a tragicomedian, I ended up doing the crazy thing of killing off the main character in this novel that started out as an everyday story.

Charlotte dismissed the commander, saying that she was done.

He assured her that it was okay to roam the upper floors, but never the basement, and left.

There were soldiers roaming the palace, but not many. If there were any, they were dedicated to searching the underground.

The Commander has told us this and that, but we're not here to tour a turning point in human history, we're here to find a clue that will improve Charlotte's condition.

"Your Highness, do you feel something?"

"......at all."

The place where the demon died.

I got there, but Charlotte didn't seem to feel anything.

After all, it's just a random place. There's no corpse of the demon left, and it's too much to hope that the demon's soul, if there is such a thing, will linger here.

Worst of all, too much time had passed. It was the site of a great battle, but there was nothing left of it except the traces of it.

"We can only hope there's something underground."

"But....... seems to be quite a bit riskier than I expected."

"Whoa, that's right."

There's even a class of enchantments that attack the mind, rather than just traps that trigger if you step on them.

"Let's start at the ground level, just in case there's something up there."

There was nothing to be found at the site of the last fight.

But the palace is large.

You don't have to go underground to explore, Charlotte said.



* * *



My memories of Mawang Castle were not so clear.

The urgency of the situation, and the speed with which time had passed since I'd met Charlotte. There was no time to spare, and I felt like I was running full speed across the ice, knowing that the slightest mistake would kill me.

This was partly due to the fact that I was in a psychologically extreme situation.

"I should have brought Darius."

Saviolin Tana said quietly.

"Hmmm....... I don't think Sir Dyrus had any fond memories of the place, so I didn't think it was necessary to bring him here."

"You're right about that, too."

Just as my memory of Mawangsung is fuzzy, so is Charlotte's. Charlotte would have spent most of her time in the camps.

Unlike me and Dyrus, Charlotte had nothing but horrible memories of the Demon Castle. Not only was it a harrowing experience, but she ended up awakening a strange power and killing everyone in the camp.

Cannibalization shock.

The resulting despair, fear, and disgust.

In the end, Charlotte killed her mother and everyone else in her cell.

Charlotte couldn't tell if she was thinking about the trauma. She was just walking through the halls of the Demon Palace.

It was new to me, too.

You're not being chased by someone and your life is not in danger.

I was able to watch the Demon King at a leisurely, if not relaxed, pace.

The ceilings in the hallways were high and the aisles were wide.

I've seen all kinds of palaces.

The Palace of Spring, the Central Palace Tetra, the White Palace Arnaria, and the Castle Epiax.

But the castle was larger than life, with ceilings and passageways that were more than adequate.

"Wow, that's huge, I wonder if it needs to be this big......."

Apparently, I wasn't the only one who thought so, as Savior Tana muttered.

"It's not like humans are walking around."

It was Charlotte who answered, not me, the demon prince.

"Ah."

"...... Isn't it?"

No.

I feel like such an idiot because Charlotte told me what I needed to know.

I don't know, because I'm not actually a demon prince!

Some demons will be bigger than that, and some will be hulking, so it makes sense to build them big.

Is this enough to get around the ogre?

Of course, not every room was big enough for those behemoths to fit through.

The hallway was littered with the remains of destroyed statues. The destroyed pieces had been removed, but the size of the alcove suggested that a sizable statue had been there.

Charlotte stopped in front of him.

"This is......."

"What's wrong?"

"...... because I remember hearing about it from Darius."

Charlotte looked at the shattered statue.

"Darius and....... that....... ugh, ugh......."

I started to say, "The kid," but Charlotte caught my eye and cut me off.

You said you were going to forget about Bali, and now you're bringing it up again.

I'm not sure why I'm even bothering with it.

"Oops, oops. Anyway. He came into the palace and got the teleportation scroll to rescue me, but when he tried to leave, he said that the knights of the Duke of Salerian had attacked to silence him."

"......such a thing."

It was the first time Charlotte had ever told Savior Tana about what had happened in the Demon Castle.



"Then, I heard that the gargoyles suddenly activated and attacked the knights, so they managed to escape unharmed......."

The memories were more vivid to me because they were mine.

The knights of the Duke of Salerian had tried to kill us, and I had thought that as I watched the gargoyles.

In this situation, you'll usually see a .

That thing was moving.

Something like this.

As if in response to my thoughts, the gargoyles activated and attacked the knights, killing one of them on the spot.

"So they must have destroyed all the statues."

There was a precedent, Charlotte seemed to conclude, and they destroyed all the statues afterward.

"......."

Saviolin Tana was silent, her eyes downcast.

She has pledged to remain politically neutral.

However, the fact that she was nearly killed by Bertus's minions after she was finally rescued from her ordeal in the Demon Castle is bound to stir up some emotions.

Of course, you're not hearing this for the first time, you probably already know this.

But as she returned to the scene and heard those words coming out of her own mouth, she could see her expression threatening to crumple.

She's already not neutral in the first place.

1Trying to save Charlotte's life, even if it's for her own survival, is never neutral.

Once Charlotte's safety is assured, we can take our hands off her problems, but that time hasn't come yet.

Her neutrality was already shaken, and it was clear that it was being further shaken by the overly horrific things Bertus was about to do.

The same goes for the things that happened to me in Mawang Castle, and afterward, I couldn't escape the after-effects and returned to Mawang Castle with terrible memories.

Despite feeling so bad for Charlotte, Savior Tana could tell that her heart was very much with Charlotte.

I could tell Tana was struggling with her belief in staying neutral and her heart leaning toward Charlotte.

"It's all right, Lord Tana."

Charlotte walks ahead again, speaking in a low voice.

"If our situations were reversed, I would have done exactly what Bertus tried to do to me."

"......."

Charlotte said with a straight face.

"That's why I knew what was coming in the first place."

In the end, it's just more of the same.

It's not that Bertus was bad, it's just that it was the right thing to do in that situation.

"So, you don't have to feel so sorry for me."

"......I apologize. Your Highness."

Charlotte said, and walked slowly down the hall.

I'm not defending Bertus, and I'm not putting myself down.

It was just something she said to ease the psychological pressure she was feeling.
