Ellen left.

Olivia stared at the back of his head in disbelief.

As much as I don't like Ellen, I'm still stuck on the idea that this isn't the way to send her off.

It was painful to imagine the look on Reinhardt's face when he woke up.

It didn't make sense to Olivia to let Ellen go.

I don't know about anyone else, but I'm sure Charlotte would want Ellen to stay.

But beyond telling me to let it go, Charlotte's demeanor bordered on harsh.

Charlotte was responsible for all aspects of Edina's nomination.

So, when the Age of Demons begins, it will be Charlotte who actually rules the world.

Eventually it comes full circle and Charlotte becomes emperor.

You have to think about the unfathomably big picture, so you can't get hung up on personal feelings.

So is it possible to tell Ellen to just let it go because she's better off without it?

With that thought in mind, Olivia glanced over at Charlotte and couldn't help but gasp.

"......."

Charlotte's eyes were squeezed shut, her mouth closed, and she was crying harder than anyone else.

What a relief.

It was Charlotte who felt the most guilty, saying that they had betrayed each other and that Ellen shouldn't be here.

So, as she watched Ellen leave, Charlotte sobbed under her breath, unable to get a proper cry out.

You know you're in the same boat.

You've made him leave of his own accord, and he won't be able to live with that.

It all worked out so well that it didn't feel like it could have.

In the end, it can't all work out.

So Olivia does something she wouldn't normally do.

"It's all crying and shit on a good day."

"Ew....... Ugh......!"

Olivia picked up Charlotte, who was sobbing under her breath, and gently patted her back.



* * *



Ellen walks through the cluttered Union camp with her hood pulled down.

Some were collecting the dead, some were trying to assess the damage, some were crying, and some just stood there, dazed, in the middle of nowhere.

The damage was probably the largest of all the battles so far.

The fight was over, but no one was celebrating.

Now that some fears were over, there were many more who were excited about the new world to come.

Because no one knows what's going to happen next.

A demon declared to be absolute evil, and a warrior touted as the one to defeat it.

The demon has saved humanity, and the warrior is on the run, slipping through the Allied lines.

People will never know who was really at fault.

Those who are exposed to a fabricated truth will be exposed to another fabricated truth.

As one disruption ends, another begins.

The fight against the monster isn't completely over, either.

But now that all the warp gates were destroyed, civilization could be rebuilt.

As time goes by.

One day, we could return to the days when civilization spread across continents.

And, although we can't be sure, if the demon does his job well, there will be no fighting between demons and humans in that world.

A world where demons and humans coexist.

Can such a world be made whole.

Can mutual hatred be overcome.

Unknown.

But Ellen can't join that world because she's the last foreign object from the Old World.

You need to live in a quiet place somewhere.

As if they don't exist.

There are still two holy relics.

The monsters remain.

So Ellen still had a lot of work to do.

You don't want people to know that the warrior is alive.

From a lowly position, somewhere in the world.

You will live to kill the remaining monsters.

If he could take responsibility for his actions in that way, he should.

Charlotte said they would see each other again someday, but Ellen didn't think they would.

You shouldn't expect that.

I think it's a little disrespectful to come back after a long time and ask if there's still a place for you.

As time passes, Reinhardt's name will remain a memory.

So, just watch from a distance.

Hopefully the new world will be a good one.

It's enough to do what you can, in a lowly position, for people in a lowly position.

And so it was, by the time the acrid smoke reached the outskirts of the cluttered Allied garrison.

Where to go.

In the middle of nowhere, in a vast expanse, trying to follow the stars.

-Ellen......! Ellen!

Ellen gritted her teeth at the sound of a voice behind her, a sobbing voice, and couldn't help but turn around.

-Where....... Where are you going! Where are you going......! Where are you going......!

Herriot de Saint-Antoine, looking like a mess and crying, came running up to me in desperation.

He can't even run properly, and he's stumbling around like he's going to trip over a rock, and he's running in a frenzy.

Despite being a great wizard, she was still in poor physical condition, so in her desperation she ran, gasping for breath as she reached Ellen and grabbed her by the sleeve.

"Don't go....... Where are you going....... I told you to stay with me. Stay with me....... I told you to stay with me, ah......."

That's it, we're done.

You said we can be together now.

You're breathing hard and your face is red with tears.

"Please don't go....... Please, don't go....... It's over. It's over. It's over. It's over. It's over. You don't have to go. Huh? What's wrong? What's wrong with you....... What about Reinhard? What's Reinhard going to do....... Huh?"

This is why I didn't want to see it.

It was also painful to have others catch on.

It was especially painful to watch Herriot.

That it's all going to be okay now, that there's only good things to come.

It pained Ellen to hear him say that, with a big smile on his face after hugging her when she woke up.

So, while she was out for a bit, I tried to make a run for it.

Why would anyone do this?

People who should love Ellen's absence, hold on to her departure.

They're the ones who should wish I wasn't there.

Now that Reinhardt is unconscious, the very people he should be wishing away are holding him captive.

Ellen looks down at Harriet, who is crying, clinging to her as if she will never let her go.

Herriot was Reinhardt's next best friend at Temple.

But we couldn't fully like each other.

We knew from the start that our hearts were in the same place.

So as much as we liked each other, as much as we cared about each other, we were bound to hate each other to some degree.

And the direction of that emotion has always been, to some extent, Harriet's jealousy of Ellen.

But now, Harriet is begging Ellen not to go.

Reinhardt said, "What are you going to do?

That's what we're talking about.

"Don't go. I don't know why you're doing this, but....... If you don't have to go, you don't have to go. We can stay together, okay?"

In the end, it's probably because Herriot de Saint-Ouen values himself as much as he values Reinhardt.

If you think about it.

It's always been that way.

At some point, this is who he's always been.

She was always giving in, always wanting to be with him, always giving in a lot to Ellen.

When jealousy and bitterness exploded.

Cheesy.

That was the harshest thing I could say to my friend.

"Actually, you don't have to go to....... to go there."

In fact, there may not really be a reason for you to disappear.

Maybe you just need to stick with it somehow, for whatever reason, and stay with it.

Whether people say the devil gave in to the hero or betrayed him.

You can also let people imagine whatever they want, pretend you don't know what's going on, and just live happily ever after.

But I've been selfish enough so far.

I betrayed Reinhardt, and I got too much.

In the end, I crossed the river of no return and was somehow saved.

I can't be any more selfish than that.

I'm blind to the other problems it will cause.

To love, to be loved.

It's crazy to ask for more than that.

You can't allow that to happen to yourself.

Give yourself that happiness.

Such anon.

I can't believe that's what life is like for me.

Compulsion to live in despair.

Feeling guilty and compelled to live to atone.

All other reasons aside.

Recognize the dark compulsion to leave, to leave only because of it.

"Then don't go....... If you don't have to go, you shouldn't go......."

Looking down at a crying, pleading Harriet, Ellen eventually stops crying.

Rather, it smiles.

"Reinhardt is right."

"Hmm......?"

Harriet looks up at Ellen, tears in her eyes at the sudden words.

What Reinhardt always called Herriot.

You want everything to work out, and you don't want anything that's only good for you.

They can't be selfish.

The biggest pain in the ass is going to go away, but he begs her to stay for Reinhardt's sake.

"You're an ass."

"Uhhh......?"

What do you call someone like that if not an idiot.

Harriet may be the smartest person Ellen knows.

In the end, it was the dumbest.

Harriet stares at Ellen in disbelief, not wanting to cry.

"I've already been given so much, so much, so much."

There is also a sense of insecurity, as if there will be some sort of punishment for being greedy.

"......."

"If you're too nice, like you are now, you'll never have anything."

You can't be nice and have nothing.

You give and give and give and give, and eventually you're out of a job.

If you want it, you can have it.

If you dream of a situation that's too perfect, you may wake up and realize that everything else has been taken away from you.

"Don't let Reinhardt take you for granted."

"......."

You'll cherish it, but if you allow yourself to take what's next to you for granted, you'll stop being desperate.

You'll always be pushed to second, third, and so on.

Without Ellen, Reinhardt was desperate for her.

With Ellen's life at stake, Reinhardt's only thoughts would be about Ellen.

I don't know Ellen Reinhardt's heart.

The mind is neither absolute nor eternal.

A lot of time has passed, and no one's mind is quite the same, and that includes Reinhardt's.

They may not even realize it.

Come to think of it, I've never made a single concession.

I hadn't even thought about that.

I don't know if that's a concession, or if I'm even qualified to say that.

But now that I've had my fill, it's time to make way for those who deserve it a little more.

Any more greed than that will lead to worse things.

So, if you're this nice, you're a little bit.

You have to stay awake.

Looking at her friend, who doesn't know what she's hearing, Ellen smiles sadly.

Because, in the words of a dear friend, you're cheesy.

Because it's always been that way.

"I'll be there."

It will fade away, unceremoniously and unwillingly, until the very end.



* * *



This is an unfamiliar ceiling.

"......."

The moment I thought that, my body jumped out of bed.

A pungent odor from somewhere.

I couldn't help but intuit that it was the smell of battle.

Cot.

And the barracks.

It means I'm in a tent.

What's going on?

"Hmph......!"

I heard a noise next to me, turned around, and there was someone there, startled awake by my getting up.

Herriot.

"Wake up......!"

-Wrong!

You're safe.

Before I could think about it, I realized that Herriot was alive.

"What....... happened?"

I fainted at the last minute.

After giving Antirrhinus his final instructions, there was no telling what would happen next.

Being alive means that Antirrhinus did not or could not kill me.

Harriet pats my anxious back gently.

"Rest assured....... I'm done."

Herriot's voice speaks volumes.

Relief mixed with sadness.

That tells me that a lot of people are okay.

But the sadness in his voice.

I had a hunch as to what that meant.



* * *



I was knocked out for three days.

Soon, three days had passed since the Battle of Diane.

We caught up with Herriot to find out what happened next.

Charlotte is taking my place, cleaning up the mess and reorganizing the Alliance.

Just cleaning up the chaos and divisions in each army would be enough to bleed them dry.

After a bit of back and forth, I heard Harriet crying as she spoke.

Ellen left.

"Sorry....... I didn't catch it....... I wanted to catch it somehow....... Somehow......."

I gingerly picked up Harriet, who was sobbing so hard that I could barely breathe, even though it had already been three days.

Ellen left.

Although I'm getting a little nervous.

I think we're good to go.

Anyway, it's back to normal, and I think it left on its own.

There are many reasons why it's shocking but not hopeless.

Perhaps, on some level, she knew that's what Ellen would do.

I only thought about getting Ellen back.

It's overwhelming just thinking about what to do.

After I got Ellen back, I didn't think about how I was going to carry her.

I didn't think about how to deal with that, and I didn't know.

According to Ellen, her presence in the world we're about to create is the seed of a great discord.

So.

It's almost scary to think that this isn't a good thing.

I realized that in the path I was about to take, I would never be the same.

The things you hold dear become worthless in the name of reality.

I'm going to have to accept that sometimes I have to throw things away and tear them down with my own hands.

Ellen returned.

Alive.

That's it.

Even that was a luxury we gave each other.

There was only one future: either one of them would die, or both of them would die.

It was impossible for us to face the future with each other alive, so I guess we should be grateful that it's possible now.

If you want more than that, you're asking for too much.

I couldn't help but laugh bitterly at the thought.

You, too, probably walked away thinking.

Thinking that anything more is a luxury.

Like I did.

So did you.

"Don't cry. It's okay."

"Black......! Hmph! Ugh......!"

Therefore, I held a sobbing Harriet in my arms and patted her back quietly.
