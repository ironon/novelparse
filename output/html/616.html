            Episode 616.





A few days after the snow stopped falling on the ecliptic, an unusually warm climate prevailed.

The new year was already upon us, and the new January had already brought with it unseasonably warm weather, even as the political climate remained frozen.

Ludwig was walking through the streets of the Temple in the unexpectedly warm weather. The gates of the Temple were just around the corner.

"Ludwig, I think you have a visitor.

"...... Guest?

The story was told to the few remaining dorm users.

'Yes, he doesn't have authorization. He said he'd wait for you outside.'

'ah.......'

As he exited the Temple Gate, Ludwig saw a woman in uniform sitting on a chair in the square in front of the dormitory.

It was the uniform of the Crusader Knights.

She stood up and smiled brightly at Ludwig.

"Ludwig."

"......."

"I'm sorry, I've been busy with a lot of things and I'm just now getting around to seeing you."

Rowen came to Ludwig alone, dressed in the uniform of the Crusaders.

"What can I do for you, new Crusader Master?"

We have just received word that Archbishop Rowen has been named the next leader of the Crusader Knights, following the sudden retirement of Elayon Bolton.

Ludwig's look at Rowen held no hostility or malice.

All that remained was the cold demeanor of a man who had closed himself off to the world.



* * *



The murder of Rowen was originally investigated by the Crusader Knights.

It was up to the Crusader Knights and the Cult of the Lord to announce who had died in that burned-out temple.

Rowen wasn't just faking his death, he was never dead in the first place.

She has now been named the next Crusader Knight Commander following the sudden retirement of Elion Bolton.

That decision was made at a papal meeting.

How can there be a papal conclave if there are no popes?

To Ludwig, who had seen five popes die at her hands, the story was a farce.

Ludwig doesn't know if Elion Bolton really retired or was murdered.

But now I didn't even care about that.

Sitting on a bench in front of the Temple Gate, Rowen said something to Ludwig, who didn't even bother to listen.

About what happened and why it happened.

Why he was almost killed, why he faked his death, why he needed time, why he approached Ludwig.

When Ludwig hears the reason for all this, he stares at Rowen.

There was no shock, no horror, no sense of betrayal at learning the truth.

"So, what did you do?"

Ludwig would only say that.

"......It's just, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's frustrating."

"Are you telling me this because I'm worthless, that you're the one who impulsed the pagans to do what they did, and that's why the Empire killed people like that, and that's why it's the way it is. Are you telling me this because no matter who I tell, no one will believe me?"

"Um......."

Rowen hesitates for a moment, then finally nods.

"I wouldn't necessarily say no, because in this day and age of rumors, people don't believe them as much as they believe them, so if Ludwig went around saying that the new crusader knight was actually the one who pulled the strings in the refugee camp, no one would believe him."

"I'm going to leave what I don't believe, and the inquisitors are going to get me."

"You're right."

I don't care if you know, so don't tell me.

Ludwig stares at Rowen with a hard expression.

"Anyway, did you think that if I heard that, I'd be convinced, that there were circumstances, that what you've been doing has been done with good intentions?"

"I didn't think so, I thought they'd say something mean or try to kill me."

"If I try to kill you, will you die?"

"Nope. Not at all."

Ludwig doesn't show any reaction to Rowen's embarrassment.

Just keep talking in a calm, cool tone.

"So you're saying that you can tell me the truth because I can't kill you for hearing it, and I can't tell people the truth because they won't believe it?"

"I wouldn't say no."

"I'd rather kill you, but not even that......."

"......."

"Not even worth killing?"

"To put it bluntly, yes."

Ludwig was not enraged by Rowen's cruel words.

"Yeah, that's fine."

"......."

"Isn't that weird?"

"What is it?"

"A few days ago, I was treated like I was useless and shouldn't know, and now I'm being treated like I'm useless and should know. Who the hell decides that?"

Some truth.

You don't need to know because you're not important.

It's okay to know, you're not important.

Ludwig ultimately found the behavior and attitudes of those who handled the truth stranger than the truth itself.

In the end, there is no value in truth.

"I've been thinking about it for a few days."

"Yes."

"Your business, the Devil's business, Ellen's business, the Empire's business. I've thought about all of those things, and I've come up with......."

Ludwig opens his mouth with a deadpan expression.

"It's not like Ellen is going to tell you that it's all your fault......."

"It all happened for a reason. I don't know, but there's a reason, there's a story."

"You wouldn't say that, or act that way, unless you had that."

"They can't be looking at each other like that."

"Everyone looks sad, and no one seems to be happy, so I'm guessing everyone had a reason."

"Well, I guess that doesn't matter anymore."

Ludwig looks at Rowen and says.

"You guys seem to think you're in a position to decide something like that."

"That's what matters."

"That's the problem."

"It's not what the truth is, it's not what the story is, it's that attitude of controlling the truth. It's the attitude that you're pretending to care about people, but you're not, and you think you can decide whether they know something or don't know something, and that's the problem."

"I saw that in you guys."

"A very unpleasant, offensive, disgusting sense of superiority."

"You don't know."

"But I'm doing something very great and noble that you don't know about."

"So you don't need to know. Get out."

"You don't know."

"But I did something really great and noble that you didn't know about, and even though it looks bad, it's not, so you understand."

"So listen. How about, listen, am I right, this is what you're doing to me?"

"Isn't this offensive?"

"Sometimes it doesn't tell you, sometimes it does."

"Same reasons, different behavior."

"If the reasoning makes sense, but the behavior is the opposite, then you're just being selfish."

"So, the attitude is the same."

"They don't even treat people who are nothing, people like me, who are worthless, like people."

"Tell me or don't tell me."

"If you go any further than that, you're thinking you're entitled to save or kill someone."

"Just as the popes, whatever wrong they may have actually done, have been put to death by your judgment."

"You guys are just a bunch of weirdos with some very presumptuous delusions."

"Truth?"

"That's it, I don't even want to know anymore."

"It doesn't matter what you're trying to do, what you want, what you've done."

"The important thing is that you're all high on something."

"Whether it's a sense of mission, malice, hatred, revenge on the world, whatever."

"Or the illusion that you're making some great sacrifice to save the world."

"You're drunk on disgusting delusions."

"It's no news to you that you're devils who deserve hell, but I can't give you that punishment because, yes, as you say, I'm nothing."

"But that doesn't make the truth go away."

"It doesn't make the truth go away."

"You're sinners, aren't you?"

"The sinner must be punished, right?"

"Well, you didn't get punished, did you?"

"The truth is this."

"I don't know what's going on with your relationship, or your feelings, or your relationship, or whatever, that I don't know, that I don't want to know, but this is the truth, simple and clear."

"There are so many people buried in what you've done, and you keep burying people, and you keep burying people, and you breathe the truth in each other's faces, and you eat it up, and you understand it, and you lick it, and it's disgusting."

"Truth should be describable in one word."

"You should have been punished, but you weren't."

"That's the only truth."

In a maze of thoughts, judgments, and stories, Ludwig eventually found a simple truth.

Sin requires a price.

If sinners are silent in the midst of each other's sins.

Someone has to be held accountable.

"That Ellen I saw the other day looked pitiful."

"He looked pitiful, so I don't blame him, and I have no reason to blame him."

"I'm sure you have a story, too, just like Ellen's, and maybe you're a poor, pitiful person."

"But."

"Was there even one person who died who didn't?"

"I feel sorry for them, and I feel sorry for them, because they had to die, not knowing anything, caught in the middle."

"So I'd rather not know the truth about you guys."

"Now, even if you guys come out and tell me everything, I'm going to close my ears."

"Because pitying you, understanding you, doesn't make the truth that you need to be punished go away somewhere."

"Because that truth is so obvious."

"Knowing nothing, I will become your enemy."

"No matter what the truth is, no matter what the truth is, no matter how much you deserve it, you're going to pay the price."

"There are so many people who have paid the price for doing nothing wrong, and so many who have been forced to pay for nothing."

"You guys involved in this shouldn't have to pay any consequences, right?"

"Whatever the reason, you guys need to be punished."

"Regardless of your intentions, you're going to pay the price."

"That's the conclusion I came to."

Sin.

There are sinners.

However, there is no referee.

It's hard to find the right line in the sand when you're dealing with the intertwined forces of the Chinese zodiac, the Empire, the Cult of the Gods, and the Demon King.

It's only easy to find the sin.

Finding the guilty party is the easy part.

And it doesn't change the truth that they weren't punished.

Whoever it is.

It doesn't change the fact that everyone is cheating, trampling, and exploiting the little guy in the name of saving everyone.

Lowen smiles at Ludwig.

"It's like seeing the old me."

Someone who was embarrassed by their own smallness.

And Rowen, now a monster, looks at Ludwig as if he were looking into the distant past.

Like it's funny.

As if that's interesting.

"What are you going to do, Ludwig, how are you going to punish these monsters?"

Uselessness can neither be punished nor rewarded.

"......."

"To be a monster's friend, you have to be a monster."

To be a monster's friend, you have to be its equal.

Rowen did just that.

"You don't realize that it's the same if you're trying to kill a monster, do you?"

To kill the monster, you have to be equal.

You have to be a monster.

Rather, if you want to kill, you need to be more monstrous.

"I know."

Ludwig stares at Rowen with dark, abyssal eyes.

Seeing Ludwig like that, Rowen felt a shiver run down his spine in a different way than when he had faced the demon himself not long ago.

"I know."

It was the thrill of creating a monster with your own hands.

Someone who was nothing is about to become something.

Whatever the reason, whatever the intent, whatever the purpose.

It's fun to be something, whether you succeed or fail.

Rowen looks at Ludwig and laughs.

"Good luck, Ludwig."

Ludwig rose from his seat, as if walking away from something unclean, as if it wasn't worth listening to Rowen's ramblings any longer.
