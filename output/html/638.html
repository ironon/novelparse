"Your Highness, the Titan's maintenance is complete."

"Great, thanks."

The Archduke was reading a book in his research barracks as Adelia briefed him.

"Your Majesty, further maintenance or upgrades to the Titan are unlikely to be possible at this time, and we expect to reach our next battle destination sooner rather than later."

"Sure, just keep the existing equipment and don't think about retrofitting."

"Is it safe to say that Titan is complete as it is?"

"I suppose."

As it stands, the Titans are only scheduled to fight in two battles going forward.

"For the next two times, that's all the Titan will be used. After that, it's better not to use Titan."

"I see."

Adelia nodded at the Archduke's words.

I'd rather not have a huge weapon of war like that.

Once the gate event is over, it can be used to deal with the remaining monsters, but should not be used for anything else.

So there was no need to improve Titan beyond this level.

This means that neither Adelia nor the Grand Duke will have to spend time hanging on to the Titan, but will always have to keep the Titan in its current state.

It means you've finally broken out of your shell.

Adelia looks at the Archduke in his chair.

Perhaps because he no longer had to work on Titan, the Archduke was reading a book, not a research paper.

I rarely talk to the Archduke about anything outside of work.

So when I saw that the Archduke was reading a book unrelated to Titan, I couldn't help but be curious.

"Do you happen to be....... May I ask what you're reading?"

I knew it was a grimoire because of the complexity and diagrammatic zines.

"It's a family vision."

"What? Oh, I'm sorry. ...... That wasn't my intention."

How dare you stare at the Saint-Tuan family's arcane tome while reading it.

I knew how important the vision statement was, so I couldn't help but blush at the presumptuousness of the question.

The Archduke smiled faintly at the despondent Adelia.

"...... I misspoke, I'm sorry. I meant that there's nothing here that you'll find interesting. It's something you already know."

The Archduke flipped the book open to reveal the title.



[horsepowerautomation-27]



"......?"

Horsepower Automatic.

Of course she knows what it is.

"Is this a book about golems?"

"Technically, it's a book about any device that uses horsepower to move. Golems are one of those things, so I guess you can't say no."

It has a magic train, it has a warp gate, it has golems.

Adelia's talent, Magiccrafting, specializes in that.

It's a very comprehensive discipline, but that probably means that there are at least 27 volumes of those ridiculously thick books.

And by the time Adelia made the Titan, she had understood and learned almost everything there is to know about golems. Much of it was passed down from House Saint-Thuan, so it was as if she had read it all, if not more.

That's why the Archduke said it wouldn't interest you because you already know it.

But Adelia is impressed with something else.

House Saint-Thuan keeps its distance from justice and the dark arts, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have an interest in all areas of magic outside of those unholy forces.

The scale of the Saint-Thuan family's vision over the years.

The book on horsepower devices alone is that thick, with more than 27 volumes, and I wonder how many other visions there are.

The weight of that time felt overwhelming to Adelia.

Without that accumulated knowledge, the Titans could not have been created, Adelia couldn't help but think.

But it was weird.

The Archduke said that there was no need to modify the Titan now.

But you're having a family vision involving a golem. I'm pretty sure I remember everything.

The Archduke shook his head, as if he knew what Adelia was questioning.

"It has nothing to do with Titans. That's not what this book is about."

"Oh....... I see."

"To be precise, there is documented research on neural networks for remote control in horsepower devices."

"The master or....... system in the master orb?"

"It's one of them."

The Archduke and Adelia use an orb called the Master Orb to power up and control the Titan.

Remote-controlled neural networks.

Adelia didn't know why the Archduke was looking at it now.

Naturally, the Archduke can't explain why he's watching this.

I can't tell you that I'm thinking about how to disable immortals because the devil wants me to.

Even the Archduke does not know the magic of Immortals.

So we don't know how to disable it.

We can only imagine.

For now, I was working through the strands.

"Have you ever been to Arnaka?"

Arnaka, capital of the Duchy of Saint Thuan.

Home of the Archduke and home of Heriot.

At that question, Adelia shook her head.

"Sorry. I haven't seen any......."

The Archduke laughed at Adelia's comment.

"There's nothing to be sorry about, it's just the way it is. Let's go when the war is over."

Adelia thought the Archduke was a little strange these days.

He is always solemn and solemn, but at the same time, he is also kind and gentle.

But lately, something.

I find myself smiling a lot.

Is it because the end of the war is near?

If only I could have seen the dignity and poise, the unflinching pride.

Plus, he now looks like a man who is determined to do something.

In the end, it looks like the Archduke is brighter than before.

Adelia doesn't know the full story.

"Anyway, we don't use any guards in Arnaria. We have very few vassals."

"Oh....... I hear you've replaced it with an automated golem."

"Yeah."

It's not exactly a secret, so of course Adelia knew about it.

The capital of Arnaka, the White Palace of Arnaria, is guarded by automated golems.

It's natural for those in positions of power to value protecting what's theirs.

Once the human variables have been controlled, Arnaria is a perfect fit.

It's a very safe place, but it's also a very lonely place, Adelia remembered hearing that once.

"It has visions of how to automate those golems and build some sort of neural network to control them remotely."

"Oh, I see."

The biggest golem in the Alliance right now is the Titan.

But of course, Titans aren't the only ones with golem power.

Steel golems of iron dart across the battlefield in short bursts of teleportation and blink magic.

Before the Titans were deployed, and even after they were deployed, Golem power was still a great addition.

Right now, the Archduke is looking at a book that tells him how to build an army of golems.

How to automate your golem.

How to steer.

How to connect that army with a magical neural network so it can be manipulated from a distance.

It reads.

So it's already here, it's already working.

It would not be the first time the Archduke had seen the book, as he had already applied his family's vision.

In other words, the Archduke is reviewing now.

Adelia wants to help the Archduke if she can.

"Did you find anything that needs to be addressed?"

Magiccrafting is also one of Adelia's talents. So if the Archduke was stuck, she wanted to do more than just work on the Titan now that she was done with it.

Whatever it is.

If I can help, I want to help.

"No, not really."

The Archduke, however, looks at Adelia as if to say otherwise.

Is the Archduke double-checking what he already knows because he has nothing better to do?

In Adelia's eyes, the Archduke seemed to be thinking about something.

"It just made me want to think about that possibility."

"What is the likelihood that......?"

"The idea that the lack of guards in Arnaria might be a vulnerability."

"What do you mean vulnerability......?"

"Adelia, suppose you could interfere with the neural network that controls the golems of Arnaria."

"Yes......?"

"Then, Adelia, you can control the golems of Arnaria even though you are outside of Arnaria, so in effect, you can open and close all the doors of Arnaria."

Seize control of the golems.

"If such a thing were possible, would not the safety of the palace of Arnaria depend on a single wizard?"

"I haven't thought about that, but if I did....... would be dangerous."

Arnaria's golems are networked together.

If you take away that network, you take away the whole golem.

"I was wondering if it was possible to do something like that. I was wondering if it's just something that no one has tried yet....... I was thinking about that."

Arnaria is just an example.

The Archduke was talking about something else entirely.

But Adelia, who has no way of knowing, is worried.

You already have a network of golems configured.

To intercept it and wrest control from the golems.

Is that even possible?

"I'm not sure, but the fact that no one else has tried that....... I'm pretty sure."

"In the past, Dispel and similar means were used to neutralize golems. But as I said, that was in the past. There's no reason to build a golem that can't resist dispel."

We make golems because we have a way to deal with dispel. Methods of resisting magical interference are also part of the golem technology.

But not by disabling it, but by interfering with the golem's control neural network altogether.

The direction is different.

The Archduke is thinking of magic that has never been done before.

If there is such a thing as magic, it's a dangerous thing.

It's not just about Arnaria, it's about the golems that the Archduke is running now, and even the Titans could be intercepted by someone.

What hasn't been thought of hasn't been studied.

This raises the possibility that it might be surprisingly easy to do.

Adelia wondered if the Archduke was thinking this to bolster Arnaria's defenses.

In any case, the Archduke's worries may be futile, but they are worries nonetheless.

If I can help, I want to help.

"Then I'll take a look at......."

-Electric charge.

Adelia was about to say something when a voice called out to the Archduke from outside the lab barracks.

"What's going on?"

One of the wizards who entered the barracks pointed outside with a stern expression.

"There's something you need to check out."

It was more of a puzzled look than an urgent one.



* * *



The sons of the Grand Duke were also there.

"Father, you have come."

"What's going on?"

The attitude was that they didn't understand.

"It's a golem."

"Yes."

A golem fell in front of the assembled mages.

Medium Iron Golem. It has only one inherent magic, Blink, a short-range teleportation spell.

However, the explosive physicality unleashed by the behemoth sweeps across the battlefield.

These days, it's a super-heated, breath-breathing monster, but it's always been one of the Archduke's countless golems, a stalwart on the battlefield.

Like Titans, Golems can be salvaged and repaired and put back into service if their internal core systems are intact.

As such, the Archduke's golem army is not reduced in numbers by much.

"As you can see, it's still intact on the outside, but I can't get it to restart at all. I've been trying to retrieve it since the last battle, when it was abandoned without its summoning spell triggered."

"I see."

There was almost no external damage. No, it had barely seen combat.

So, we find a healthy golem abandoned on the battlefield, immobilized, and we retrieve it.

But no matter how many times he tried to bring them back to the camp, he couldn't, so he called in the archduke.

At his first son's words, the Grand Duke examines the golem.

But even the Archduke narrows his eyes.

"All the internal horsepower circuits are destroyed. No, not destroyed. Every part is intact."

The Archduke could see why the other mages had called him.

"Only the enchantments that were planted have 'evaporated', is this possible?"

If it's a total loss, that's understandable. However, there is no external damage, and the internal components, magic stones, and devices are still intact.

Only the enchantments were cleanly removed.

So now the Archduke was looking at a golem that had been destroyed in the strangest way in the world.

"Looks like a powerful dispel spell hit......."

The Archduke just said that there's no way his golem would be subject to a Dispel-type neutralization spell.

Obviously, monsters don't use dispel. And even if they did, there's no way the Archduke's golem would be immune to such a disabling spell.

Do monsters use magic now?

A dispel powerful enough to neutralize an Archduke's golem?

So what about Titans?

What if it wasn't a golem, but a Titan, that fell victim to this mysterious method?

If that had happened, every wizard in the world might have despaired.

"I....... Do you mind if I take a look?"

While the Archduke was still frozen, Adelia spoke softly.

The Archduke, as well as the other wizards, are on their way, and Adelia begins to inspect the golem.

Like the Archduke's horse, it was an oddly neat mess.

All the vital parts are intact, all the magic stones are intact.

However, the golem's magic circuitry to function as a golem has been destroyed.

No, it's not destruction. If it was, there would be no trace of it among the destroyed circuits.

It's gone, as cleanly as if someone had just ripped out the entire horsepower circuit.

Is it possible to neutralize such a sophisticated and precise dispel, especially against a golem that already has a countermeasure for dispels?

It's a ridiculous idea, both for the Archduke and his wizards.

Of the recovered golems, the most intact ones were the most damaged.

Everyone is freaking out because they think the monsters might be using powerful dispel magic.

"Ah....... I think I know what's going on......."

However, Adelia was the only one who knew what was going on.



* * *



After reassuring the Archduke that if he was right, it was nothing to worry about. Adelia headed off somewhere.

It was a Temple garrison, a Royal Class garrison.

Adelia has no choice but to know who the culprit is.

"Send the golem to......? Me?"

"Yes. Do you remember?"

It was Scarlett, the red-haired girl.
