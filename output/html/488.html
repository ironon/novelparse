Extremely refined enchantment powers are actually mana draining.

In the first place, the blue aura that enchanter's bodies were bathed in was merely a form of incomplete combustion, caused by the release of mana that had not been properly condensed.

Therefore, a proper disenchantment will not result in force release.

Full disenchantment.

I succeeded in taking that first step.

With only a fraction of my mana, I was able to compress it to the limit with calm and serenity, creating an extremely refined power enhancement that would not release any energy.

"I thought I'd gotten some kind of weird vibe from you, but it looks like you've accomplished something."

Luna smiled slightly, as if she had read something in my eyes, even though I hadn't said anything.

Technically, neither Luna nor Ronan taught me anything.

Technically, it was Arta who gave me that hint.

"Try it."

Since I knew what I was being asked to do, I went ahead and used the Enchantment.

A tiny fraction of my mana.

Not for the release of power, but for the feeling of letting my image become a stream of mana that flows through my body.

Not for combat.

It feels like a physical manifestation of a serene mind.

Nothing changes, but you feel an exhilarating rush of energy coursing through your body.

It's definitely a weaker output than when it's at full power, but there's definitely a sense that it's maximizing efficiency.

Luna watches me as I succeed in refining my magic to the limit.

And.

Looking at me, Luna puts her thumb and middle finger together and points it at my forehead.

"......Mom?"

Commonly, it's called the crab pose.

-Bam!

"Eek!"

My head was thrown back in a giant whirlwind of grinding, and it stayed that way.

No what.

Suddenly, what!

"No! What are you doing all of a sudden!"

I blurted out, and Luna smiled and pointed at me.

"Look at you."

"......?"

Luna pointed to my body, which was clearly enveloped in a pale but blue mana.

I immediately understood what she was trying to say.

A single blow to the chestnut disturbed my composure. You've lost control of your mana flow, and it's leaking outward.

"It's not ready for prime time, right?"

"It's ......."

Maintaining a tranquil mindset and being in complete control of your mana flow.

I must use this power for combat.

So the idea of being disorganized after one night of being hit was not something I could use in the real world.

With a few more deep breaths, the outward emanations soon faded and disappeared. But he hadn't disengaged his enchantment.

Help Luna up after she falls.

"Going forward, try to keep it like this for the entire day."

"That the homeostasis of the mind may be manifested in the homeostasis of the body."

"So that managing mana becomes more natural than breathing, so that by the end you don't even realize you're managing it."

"Do you understand?"

Maintaining this intact enchantment throughout the day means that you must maintain a serene mental image throughout the day.

It should become so natural that by the end you don't even realize you're enchanting.

If I can get to that point, I will have reached a point where I can maintain a serene mindset throughout the day without much effort.

Maintain a clear mind without conscious thought, without effort.

Soon, you'll enter the stage of the Mingjing Water.

"Yes."

I do disenchantment all day long, and it's very sophisticated.

You need to maintain a level of disenchantment throughout the day, and a very sophisticated level of disenchantment at that.

Could it be.

"So you start by just getting through the day."

That's what I was thinking, of course, but when Luna told me that this was just the beginning, I was stumped.



* * *



What Luna asked me to do was very simple.

Maintaining disenchantment throughout the day.

The fact remains that my horsepower is one of the highest in the world. That's why I've been able to use hp buffs for so much longer than most.

Even if you just spit out the output as it is, the way it is, it will last at least two hours. That's a lot of power for a lot less efficiency.

So, it should actually be easy to maintain a full day of enchantments that only use a fraction of the amount of enchantments I have.

Of course.

It wasn't easy at all.

"Hey, what are you doing?"

-Took

"Ouch, you bastard!"

"What, what, why are you suddenly so angry?"

Arta approached and tapped me on the shoulder, and I frowned at the glow of blue magic emanating from her body.

Maintaining immobility, not just disenchantment.

Staying that way all day, every day, was not normal.



* * *



For a week after receiving Luna's assignment, I was careful not to encounter any outside stimuli.

Of course, we realize that this is a misunderstanding of Luna's intentions.

What I would have to do was not lock myself in a corner or sit under a waterfall and stay enchanted all day, but rather go about my daily life and still be in a state of extreme enchantment.

It probably means that you need to maintain that state while eating, talking to someone, or helping with farming.

However, I couldn't even get to that stage.

Just by myself, sitting in bed, I couldn't last an hour with that extreme disenchantment.

I would break out in a cold sweat after about 30 minutes, and I would eventually get tired of the weeding and let it go.

Even if no one else touched it, it was a pain to keep it that way by myself.

When you put all your energy into maintaining your peace of mind, you become exhausted by it.

I was actually feeling this weird threshold where my peace of mind was being ruined by trying to maintain it.

When I got distracted, wondering if over-focusing was the problem, the texture of the enchantment changed, and I was forced to revert to the old way of enchanting, where mana was released outward.

In the first place, the old way of enchanting required extreme mental focus. It's already hard enough to get used to enchantments that drain your mental energy, but now you have to get used to a new method that requires you to focus your mind many times more.

Two weeks after realizing the new way of enchanting.

"......That's crazy."

Even with minimal external stimulation, I couldn't maintain this state for more than two hours.



* * *



Eventually, I realized that this wasn't going to work, and I couldn't stand the frustration, so I called it a day and met with Arta and Lena.

"What have you been doing lately, running around begging like you're sick or something?"

"......Yes."

Arta said that's where she saw him, taking a step and resting for a moment, taking a step and resting for a moment, just in case he happened to go outside and the focus of his enchantment broke.

If a stranger had seen it, they would have thought he was a bit of a dick.

Arta nodded, as if she finally understood why I was looking the way I was.

"An entire day of enchantment? Is that even possible?"

Lena shook her head, then looked at Arta and asked.

"What about Arta, can you do it?"

"Well, I haven't tried it, but I'll probably burn out before then."

No, so he can do it all day if his horsepower allows him to, is that it?

Staying floating throughout the day.

Ellen would be the right personality to do this.

Saviolin Tana, who went on to become a grandmaster, also seemed to have few emotional ups and downs.

Of course, that's Ellen's personality, but does that mean that people who have mastered the art of magical enhancement naturally evolve into something a bit more like a chump?

But no matter how I looked at it, Arta didn't seem like that kind of guy.

He's not a frivolous guy, but he's not a dick either.

"Hey, what's your secret to staying focused?"

"......Secrets?"

"Yeah."

Arta doesn't seem like a very disciplined guy.

But Arta was capable of using extreme enchantments in real life, even if it was a practice match.

I would be very cautious about even moving around while using and maintaining extreme enchantments.

Obviously, there's no such thing as a practice match.

I don't know about you, but I don't think I'd want to be anything less than Arta.

At my question, Arta crosses her arms with a hmmm.

"Well....... I'm not sure if there's a trick to it......."

In terms of sheer power, he's better than me and Ellen. In terms of actual skill, neither I nor Ellen can compare to Arta.

"I don't know. I guess I'm supposed to stay enchanted all day like you do, but I've never done anything like that."

"Then why don't we just do it?"

Arta said, and Lena nodded.



* * *



Before I knew it, Arta was doing what I was doing.

It wasn't a waterfall like it used to be, it was sitting still in a clearing and maintaining the disenchantment.

This sustained hold ends the moment I get distracted and release my mana to the outside world. I could refocus and return to that state, but what Luna wanted me to do was to maintain this state all day.

"......Whoa, damn."

I stayed like that for about an hour before I got tired of it.

There was plenty of horsepower, but it felt like my mind was being gnawed away at in real time.

Arta, on the other hand, sat still, focused, and unmoving.

I ended up sitting next to him for about three hours as I tried to focus my attention, and it got distracted.

"Ugh, I'm exhausted, I can't do this anymore."

Nearly drained of energy, Arta lasted about three hours before collapsing.

I'm feeling mentally gnawed, so about an hour.

Arta has no problem with her mental capacity, but her horsepower is limited to about three hours.

That was their limit.

"I don't know, are you saying that Arta is a big deal?"

Lena could only shake her head at this result, as she had no idea what we were doing in the first place.

"As much as I hate to admit it, I do."

"Why put a label on something you don't want to admit?"

Arta giggled, sagging.

We don't know what Arta's actual horsepower is, but it probably isn't very high. She's just using that horsepower with maximum efficiency.

This means that when I make this method completely my own, I will have strength and staying power that I have never had before.

"Anyway, anyway, I don't know. The secret to mental focus? I don't know. I don't know."

Arta said, lying sagging on the dirt floor, staring blankly at the sky.

The secret to staying focused.

When I think about it, it's like Arta said, what's the point?

I'm good at this because I'm good at focusing.

"Hmm, I'm not sure, but I think I know the difference between Arta and Reinhardt."

However, Lena, who has been watching me and Arta for the past three hours, shakes her head in disbelief.

"Really?"

At Arta's question, Lena nodded.

"Arta has no idea."

"......? All of a sudden?"

Arta bristled at the insinuation that he was an ignoramus.

"And Reinhardt has too many ideas."

"......Yes."

"So, Arta is kind of sagging, kind of letting things happen, and Reinhardt is kind of giving his whole body and eyes a workout......."

Lena looks at me.

"Reinhard, looking at you makes me tired."

"ah......."

"If I'm tired of watching, how tired must you be of doing?"

"What goes around comes around, right?"

At my words, Lena glances at Arta, who is sprawled out in the clearing.

A real-life example of how to stay focused when you're stretched thin.

Lena's simple point left me speechless.

"I do have thoughts, too......."

Arta didn't look pleased to hear Lena call him a brainless bastard.
