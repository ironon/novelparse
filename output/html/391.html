            Episode 391.





We were treated like special students in a royal class.

I'm not supposed to take my major classes on the days I have major classes, but I canceled all of my other classes and spent the entire day getting combat training from Saviolin Tana. I wasn't in a position to discuss credits, but I was told that they would take care of that.

Ellen and I played against each other, but we also ended up playing against Saviolin Tana.

Alsbringer definitely boosted my performance, especially against Savior Tana.

That doesn't make you a Swordmaster, though.

I really like the idea of Alsbringer's basic ability: the stronger your opponent is, the stronger you are.

They've stolen the cheat for the main character.

And the problem Tana pointed out.

Against Saviolin Tana, I often found myself in a situation where my physical abilities increased so drastically that I lost control of my stride, which was problematic because it made me stronger.

"Ugh!"

"Watch out!"

-Bam!

"Kek!"

She grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and pulled me back into proper position as I was about to do nothing and twist myself into a bad position.

I even tried to see if I could win against Ellen in the same state I was in against Savior Tana, but it was pointless.

It's pretty clear that you're going to lose worse than you did before.

I stared at the Alsbringer in my right hand.

"......."

"Don't feel sorry for yourself. It's natural to be unfamiliar with things you've never used before."

You have to get used to being pushed beyond your level of physical ability.

The stronger the opponent, the stronger you are, which is a very powerful but overly ambiguous buff, so it's important to be aware of your physical abilities and adjust accordingly.

It's a powerful force, but if you can't control it, you might be better off not using Alsbringer.

"Let's try again."

"Yes."

I don't know if I'll ever need to unleash the true power of Alsbringer.

However, Alsbringer is already a very powerful artifact in its own right.

I have to get used to this power.

Saviolin Tana trained us in many ways.

My duel with Ellen.

And then you're going one-on-one with Ellen and me.

After feedback time, we taught karate.

I've never beaten Ellen, and of course I've never beaten Saviorin Tana, and the same goes for pincer.

But Tana, who says she's not used to teaching, is by no means incapable of it.

That wasn't all.

"Let's talk about what to do when you're stranded in the field."

She taught us how to not just fight in combat, but how to survive in combat, such as how to survive a firefight and how to survive when isolated in enemy territory.

This would have been the same thing taught in the Temple Combat Major class, now renamed Combat Training.

Of course, that's not her role. It's just that this whole situation where Ellen and I are being educated by her is a classified secret, and Saviolin Tana is playing the role of teacher from start to finish.

I learned how to infiltrate enemy lines, how to bypass magical bindings, and how to behave in uncharted territory.

The two of us learned about things like surviving alone as opposed to operating with someone, or assassinating a factor.

That's what being a warrior is all about.

An assassin who infiltrates an enemy camp and decapitates their leader.

In reality, what Lagan Artorius did was not so different from that, which is why Saviolin Tana was teaching us to be assassins, not soldiers.

"Of course, it's also possible that the demon is lurking in the Human Continent instead of the Darklands, and even if we find him, he could escape via teleportation. We'll teach you what to do in that case, as well as how to start a war."

From how to spot hidden enemies in a human city to fighting in the streets, Savior Tana seemed to have a lot to teach us.

You're not just learning swordsmanship.

But, somehow.

When you learn how to hunt, you naturally learn how to run.

Soon, I was learning how to run away, not how to hunt.

Where eternal winter reigns.

Vampire Council.

"Antirrhinus, how's it going?"

"It's a very high-level spell, so it's going to take some time to design, but the Order's mages are very good, so it shouldn't take too long."

In response to Eleris' question, Antirrhinus said.

The construction of the dungeons and labyrinths of the Darklands was well underway. The grimoire, Quantum Maze, was of great interest to the Black Order as well as to Antrianus; it was perfect for the current situation and purpose.

"That's interesting, how did you get such a powerful grimoire?"

"I'm afraid I can't answer that."

"Hehe, you don't trust me that much."

Eleris sighed heavily at Antrian's dismissive attitude. There was no way she was going to share the location of the demon castle's underground libraries with someone who was likely to rush there as soon as he learned of them, and she had no say in the matter.

In recent times, the Vampire Council has met frequently. These meetings, which occurred once every few years or even decades, were due to the council's working relationship with the Demon King.

"How did Lucinil get into Temple?"

"Yes."

Lucinil smiled and nodded at Lerouen's question. Lucinil left the Temple after class and teleported straight to the council meeting.

"Even if it's necessary, isn't it inconvenient? It must be a pain."

"What's the big deal, I'm surrounded by cute kids?"

"You know ......, Lucinil? Sometimes I don't understand Lucinil more than I understand Antirrhinus."

"I pity your dry sensibilities that don't recognize cute as cute."

"Don't say it."

Lucinil is as much of a dilettante as Antirrhinus when it comes to traveling. He was admitted to the Temple by agreement, of course, with the understanding that he would need close protection, but when it was suggested that it was necessary, Lucinil seemed delighted.

"Anyway, let's not forget the original purpose of security."

"You're on your own, you monster."

"A monster that comes out of a flask when you shake it a few times. That's ridiculous."

"Uh, that....... That, that's a really hurtful thing to say, isn't it......?"

"You're the first one to call me a monster."

"Well, I did....... I'm sorry......."

Galarsh crossed his arms as Lucinil sulked.

"I was harsh with my words. I apologize."

You live so long that you learn to apologize quickly when you can't be bothered to argue with each other. Galarsh looked at Lucinil, his large teeth clicking together as the atmosphere subtly stiffened.

"Okay, so you're on close protection, so you're familiar with the current situation. Are there any particular threats or problems? We're holding hands for now, but we don't know what the Black Order might be up to behind the scenes......."

"Ah, yes! Alsbringer!"

Lucinil suddenly turned bright red and jumped to her feet, as if her sullen demeanor had been forgotten.

"Our Archdemon! We were chosen by Alsbringer!"

He looked like a mom who'd just gotten her kid a job somewhere nice.

Naturally, there was a momentary panic in the council. Even Antirrhinus panicked.

Tiamata, and Alsbringer.

Valier held two holy relics.

Eleris, in particular, listened with wide eyes.

Eleris had told Valerie that Alsbringer's master would be Ludwig.

It would either mean they were wrong, or the future had changed.

Or hump.

It's also possible that Valerie was lying.

"That guy, no matter what he does, he's going to do one big thing, and it's gotten to the point where it's weird not to."

The choice of two holy objects is consistent with the will of the gods. However, these are the ones who know the truth about the gods and demons. Humans believe that the gods choose for humans, but this is not the case.

The will of the gods, if it exists, chose Valier.

"Maybe the gods are finally siding with the demons."

Lerouen said, smiling faintly. It was a smile that said so, but seemed to be of little interest to humans or demons alike.

The holy objects have been on the side of the humans for so long, maybe they're siding with the demons now.

Galarsh crosses his meaty arms and mutters.

"I don't believe in the will of the gods. But having two holy relics....... like there's some kind of great current, and the Devil can't help but be a major player in it."

Eleris stared at the table, unable to keep the sadness out of her eyes.

"In a way, the thing that killed the father is now in the hands of the son."

Antirrhinus said, smiling in amusement.

"So, so to speak....... I guess?"

Rusinil looked dumbfounded, as if that perspective hadn't occurred to him.

"I don't know, you looked a little peeved."

Lucinil recalled the look on Reinhardt's face when the Alsbringer was given to him.

I thought, "Why would he do that to me when I can't even like him," but then I realized that's what he was supposed to do, and Lucinil understood.

Eleris stared down at the table, her expression grim.

'Alsbringer has....... degraded.......'

Elise stays still, watching the blizzard rage against the windows beyond the conference room.

We don't know if they were wrong about the future or if they were lying in the first place.

Bali is getting stronger.

Are you strong because there are things coming up that you need to get through with that strength.

I wonder if getting stronger brings with it things that you have to overcome.

Eleris couldn't tell.

"You mean special activities?"

Ms. Sarvina sighed when she saw Olivia's extracurricular application.

"Yes, sir."

"Olivia, it's true that extra-curricular activities count towards your senior year, but you've already had a year off, and you're aiming to graduate this year......."

"There's not much more to learn."

Olivia Ranze wasn't wrong: she'd given up on her major altogether and switched to swordsmanship to graduate. But since neither her divine powers nor her swordsmanship could compare to those of the other graduates, the classes were, to put it mildly, a waste of time.

So you've decided that it's good to get experience outside of the temple that you can't get inside of it, and that's not arrogant, it's just plain right.

"Sometimes the class will be excused, but if it goes too long, like last time, I may be forced to pay for it."

Ms. Sarvina's comment made Olivia smile.

"That's good."

Ms. Sarvina couldn't understand the words, but she couldn't seem to break Olivia's resolve.

But Ms. Sarvina shook her head when she saw what Olivia had written on the extracurricular activity sheet and where they were going.

"Yeah. It's not that dangerous here, and there's a team of investigators from the Empire here, so it shouldn't be too bad....... Why on earth would you want to go here?"

The corner of Olivia's mouth twitched upward.

"I want to find a trail of demons."

Olivia's destination.

Raziern, the capital of Levaina.

Not long ago, it was the site of a demonic attack.
