The Immortals began to slaughter indiscriminately, but the damage was minor.

Scarlett and Kono Lint, who moved up and down the battlefield and focused on neutralizing Immortals.

But the Allies saw the Immortals attacking the Allies.

No one could really see the fight going on deep inside Diane.

Even those who fought near it knew nothing about it, except that it was the site of a series of extraordinary events.

So neither the outcome of the final fight, nor the process.

No one knew.

No one had seen what happened after the otherworldly dragon disappeared.

Not even the monsters could reach the core, so it was Olivia Ranze, who unleashed the power of death and took control of the skies as she slaughtered the remaining monsters and dug deep into Diane's heart.

What Olivia saw was Reinhardt, stunned, holding Ellen in his arms, in the middle of some kind of battle.

They returned with Olivia on the dragon.

Immortals are wiped out.

All of Diane's warp gates are destroyed.

The remaining monsters were either scattered or slaughtered by the allied forces.

The rain has stopped.

The war is over.



* * *



-Tadac

All around Diane, smoke rises from the burning corpses of the monsters.

The Gate Crisis is now fully concluded, and while there will still be countless remaining monsters scattered across the continent, there will no longer be an influx of monsters from the Otherworld.

Humanity has survived.

But as ever, the mood of the should-be hopeful Allies was grim.

For one thing, the sacrifices were greater than any other battle to date.

The Immortals, who had made the war easy up to this point, suddenly attacked the Allies in the final fight.

It's as if they're trying to make you pay for taking it easy.

The resulting confusion, distrust of the empire, and anger were widespread.

Then there was the chaos caused by the sudden appearance of the demonic forces, and the fact that they fought harder than anyone else.

Not everyone on the battlefield saw the Demon appear and fight, but those who did, even from a distance, witnessed the Demon's desperate flight as he killed the monsters, luring the Immortals to kill him.

And, apparently, the fight against the final, unidentified monster, and the vague knowledge that the Devil was involved in what was happening in the depths.

Distrust of the Empire.

And whether or not to trust the long-hated devil.

In the midst of this complexity, the Allies were caught between a rock and a hard place.

At least things were better for the command center.

They were aware of the demonic involvement in the Alliance in the first place, and some even chose to support it.

And now, even those who oppose him know they have no choice but to support him.

Knowing that the Empire had fatally betrayed him when it mattered most convinced him that the Empire was no longer on the side of humanity.

The Allies would rather kill them all than have them fall to the Demon Army.

What happened in the Battle of Diane was not lost on anyone.

As such, the Allied Command was already overwhelmingly in favor of the Demon King.

That's why the leaders of the Demon Army could casually stroll into the General Headquarters barracks and take a seat near the front of the room, even if they were met with fearful stares.

But it was a very unexpected person who now sat at the head of the Allied General Staff.

"Has each military casualty been counted?"

No longer a man of the Empire, though his appearance resembles that of a demon.

Not the man of the empire, but the man who can't.

Charlotte de Gradias sat in the highest seat of the Alliance as the representative of the Demon Army in place of Emperor Bertus.

Something has changed.

It was a bizarre power shift that made me wonder if nothing had actually changed.



* * *



Near the General Headquarters Barracks, where access is strictly controlled.

Access to the General Headquarters was strictly controlled, even as the remaining monsters were being exterminated.

But everyone will know anyway.

The leadership of the Alliance will be replaced by the forces of the Devil.

"Shouldn't you be in a meeting?"

Harriet shook her head as she watched Olivia perch on a crate near the barracks.

"I don't like talking about headaches."

"......Isn't everything you're going to do going to be a headache? You already hate it, so what are you going to do?"

"I don't like....... Cut me some slack today."

"Hmmm....... If you put it that way, there's nothing I can do about it......."

In effect, Olivia was the general manager of all denominational issues going forward.

Olivia had more work to do than Rowen, the Crusader Knight Commander, who was probably chattering away in the barracks right now.

I couldn't help but feel bad for Harriet as she walked out of the meeting, sighing heavily, saying she didn't want to think about it.

Of course, Olivia's performance was nothing to write home about.

He raised legions of monsters to fight monsters, flew across the battlefield on a dragon, and raised countless others from the dead.

The dying are brought back to life by the passing of a dragon cloaked in brilliance.

It was such an overwhelming and miraculous sight that it left a lasting impression on Herriot and everyone else.

A saint riding a dragon.

Rumors were already swirling in the Allied ranks.

You're safe.

It's miraculous.

Everyone fought in the most dangerous places, but none of the demon's closest aides were killed or injured.

Everyone played a role, and every single one of them made a difference.

In the Battle of Diane, he did something so important that the absence of just one of the demonic forces would have shifted the damage scale by 10,000 units.

Herriot, Riana, and Scarlett were the biggest influences.

Without Scarlet, the Allies might have been wiped out against the runaway Immortals.

Olivia looks at Harriet, her eyes bleary with fatigue.

"Is Reinhardt up yet?"

"I think so."

"What the hell happened to ......?"

"I don't know."

But even those who played such an important role didn't know what was going on in the depths of Diane's heart.

An overwhelming monster.

Sudden evaporation.

By the time Olivia arrived, it was all over.

You realize that Ellen and Reinhardt are safe, and you bring them back, but you still don't know what happened.

"And her?"

At Olivia's question, Harriet shook her head.

"I guess I don't remember anything."

I'm referring, of course, to Ellen.

"What happened? Where the hell did that thing on him go? I'm glad you got rid of it, but was there a way to do it?"

Ellen doesn't remember anything, and Reinhard is passed out.

It's a strange finish, one that feels like it's over, but doesn't leave a pleasant aftertaste.

"But....... I'm glad you're safe. Everyone."

At Olivia's grumbling sincerity, Harriet's eyes widened in surprise.

"Yes, thank you."

"......."

Olivia blushed and pursed her lips in embarrassment, while Harriet smiled.



* * *



A barracks near the General Headquarters.

Ellen sat still in the chair in front of the cot, staring down at Reinhardt as he lay unconscious.

You don't know when they will regain consciousness.

"Ellen?"

"......Yes."

Herriot stepped into the barracks and studied Ellen's complexion.

Ellen knows what Harriet is worried about right now.

When Ellen woke up, she was so out of breath that it took a while for her to calm down.

"It's okay. It's gone. I can feel it."

"Thank goodness......."

Harriet smiled in relief and threw her arms around Ellen's neck.

I never thought I'd have a moment like this again.

But then, miraculously, this moment came.

The moment when you can hold each other and not worry about anything.

The moment came again.

Overwhelmed by the moment, Herriot started crying again, and Ellen patted him on the back for a long time.

Ellen doesn't know what happened.

It's important to know what happened in the last fight, Reinhard is knocked out and Ellen doesn't remember anything.

However, Olivia returned to pick them up from the middle of the battlefield.

I also heard all about how the Battle of Diane went.

Immortal's exit, re-entry, and runaway.

Until annihilation.

It's not hard to imagine what's to come.

The empire is gone, and it will be denied to all.

The Devil will rule over mankind.

"Let's stay together now. Because it's all over....... Because the sadness is over....... Just like before. Huh?"

"......Yes."

Ellen nodded slowly, clutching at Harriet's arm, which was holding her tightly.

You can't pretend something hasn't happened.

That's not to say there won't be bumps in the road.

But there was something to be gained, something to come back to.

Ellen stares down at Reinhardt, who is sleeping peacefully.

We don't know what he did, but Reinhardt must have redeemed himself somehow.

I don't remember, but I distinctly remember hearing a desperate voice on the other side of my faint consciousness.

I know it's been an uphill battle.

That's why he's probably in a deep sleep.

-Snarl

Ellen summons Cloak of the Sun.

Ellen doesn't realize that the holy objects have been out of her hands for a while.

Gone are the flames of hatred that flickered from the sun's cloak.

Something that was filled with hatred has taken up residence in you, a flame that burned with the fuel of that hatred, and it's no wonder it's gone.

The hate is gone, and the flames of hatred no longer manifest in the sun's cloak.

This time, Ellen summons Lament, the Moon Sword.

But the moon sword was still projecting the dark night sky.

The hate is gone.

But the sadness didn't go away.

That's why a moon sword that responds to grief still projects emptiness.

-Snarl

After returning the sword and cloak, Ellen touches Reinhardt's sleeping forehead.

The hate was gone, but the sadness was not.

It's because he knows that whether he comes back or not, he won't be there.

Reinhardt, with eyes filled with sadness, who has managed to save himself, but will never see himself again.

Your loved one's forehead and hair.

Ellen continued to sweep, over and over, as if it were the last time.

"I love you."

Forever.

I wish I could whisper those words in your ear forever.

Heroes and demons cannot coexist.

The existence of one always excludes the other.

In a world where heroes win, there should be no demons.

There should be no heroes in a world where the devil wins.

"I really....... I love you so much."

Thank you.

I love you.

Ellen whispered the words over and over again.

"Sorry......."

Ending, crying.

"I'm so....... I'm so sorry......."

My heart sank as I realized I couldn't be with him.



* * *



Night time.

When Ellen cautiously exited the tent, Olivia Ranze, leaning back against a crate, stared at her.

It's not what you'd call a good relationship.

They were uncomfortable with each other, and there were times when they actually got into fistfights.

But Olivia Ranze returned with Reinhardt, whom she had found on the battlefield, as well as Ellen.

"Thank you, you got me there......."

"Where are you going?"

But before Olivia could thank Ellen, she had a question.

Olivia looked at the dried tears in the corners of Ellen's eyes.

Olivia knew what Ellen was trying to do.

"......."

Olivia stares at Ellen, whose jaw drops, and Olivia stares back.

"I don't know what you're thinking, but just stay in there, it's over."

Ellen looks up with difficulty.

"Because it's over....... I'm not supposed to be here......."

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over.

Now something else will start.

You have to travel a long way down a road you don't know how far.

In the new history that will be written in the name of the Devil, there should be no heroes.

It will create a lot of cacophony just by existing.

Those who reject his tyranny will add many more hopes to the names of heroes. It can only be the beginning of division.

There's already a huge faction called the Mercenary Order.

Just because the devil is taking over the world doesn't mean it's going to be a smooth ride.

There will be a lot of blood.

And the presence of a warrior will only absolutely increase the amount of blood that must be spilled.

But you can't throw away the life you saved, so you have to hide somewhere in the world.

The idea of a demon and a hero joining forces to create a new world is a ridiculous idea that no one will believe.

The warriors will be divided into two camps: those who support the heroes and those who support the devil.

It will divide the world by creating false hopes, and it will cause another great many deaths.

So in a world where heroes win, the devil wins.

In a world where the devil wins, there should be no heroes.

So, just as empires doom themselves, so must heroes.

Olivia knows what Ellen is talking about.

More is not always better.

It shouldn't be.

There's nothing wrong with that, obviously.

"I, I don't deserve to be here."

Ellen betrayed Reinhardt.

In the end, that truth doesn't change.

"If I'm....... I'm not supposed to be there, I'm going to get in trouble for being there, and I don't deserve to be there."

It's already good enough to be saved.

To accept anything more from Reinhardt would be a disservice to those who trusted him in the first place.

You can't be presumptuous.

"I don't know that shit."

"......."

"Do you think it would be good for me to have you stay with us?"

"......."

"Do you think I'm saying this because I like you?"

From Olivia's perspective, Ellen has always been an eyesore.

I'd welcome it with open arms if it went away.

But Olivia didn't want to let Ellen leave.

For Reinhardt's sake, who had been waiting for this moment, I couldn't let him go.

"Without you, Reinhard would be dead."

"You saved Reinhardt, and you saved Reinhardt, and you saved Reinhardt, and that's it, don't think about anything else complicated, is that hard?"

"Just shut up like an idiot and say something!"

-Bam!

"......."

Olivia harshly squeezed Ellen's cheek.

Do what Ellen did one day, and give it back to her.

Olivia's eyes filled with tears.

"Just be still, how hard is that, just be there, it's not going to be easy, but we'll figure it out, just like we've figured it out so far!"

"I want to....... I want to......."

At Olivia's insistence, Ellen's eyes fill with tears.

"I want to be with you....... together....... like we used to....... I want to stay like that......."

As well as others.

Olivia Ranchuwado.

We'll bicker and get on each other's nerves, but I want to get back to those moments.

Ellen is shaking and freaking out, and Olivia looks on in disbelief.

"But you're not supposed to do that....... I, because of me, have killed so many people....... I, because of my greed....... Because I wanted to be with you. Because I wanted to be with Reinhardt....... I can't let people die because of me......."

There are people whose very existence is a rationale.

Ever since Gate, Ellen has been under the microscope.

You've been expecting something different than what you've actually committed to, and that will continue to be the case after the war.

The mere fact that Ellen is alive is enough to ignite a war, a huge wildfire.

So you can't just stay here because you want to be here.

It's a sad state of affairs, but with the Devil planning to take over the world, it was a foregone conclusion that the next seat would be Ellen's.

If he's living a simple life in the countryside, that's fine, but if he's got big plans, Ellen can't be around.

Ellen is the biggest obstacle to the Demon's future world. In fact, she'd be better off dead.

Olivia couldn't force it anymore.

It's not that I don't know. I know it's best for Ellen to go because of the problems her mere presence will cause.

Olivia also wants Ellen to be gone.

But don't get too excited.

In the end, I succeeded in doing what I thought was impossible.

All the way back to Ellen at the end.

After waking up, Reinhardt has to face the fact that Ellen is gone.

It shouldn't be.

So as much as Olivia wanted Ellen to leave, she couldn't let her go.

"Well, at least until he wakes up."

That's why Olivia had to say it in the end.

But even that doesn't work, and Ellen shakes her head in frustration.

"No....... I won't be able to, or rather, I won't be able to......."

The moment you speak to an awakened Reinhardt, he's going to freak out.

If you give it a little hug, it will collapse in your arms, wanting to stay there forever.

Even now, I can barely keep my feet on the ground, and I'm afraid that if I share even a few words with an awakened Reinhardt, I'll be unable to get up from the spot.

That's why I'm leaving.

It's now or never.

So Ellen tries to go when Reinhard hasn't gotten up yet.

"What a dumbass bitch......!"

Olivia was about to slap me when she finally did.

"Let me go."

A voice from behind her stopped Olivia's hand.

"What......?"

There was Charlotte, a former imperial and second Archdemon with hair so black it seemed to melt into the darkness.

"Ellen is right."

Charlotte approached slowly, gently releasing Ellen's grip on Olivia.

"It's not over, it's just beginning, and if we get the first step wrong, the whole thing will fall apart before we even get started."

"......."

"So, you have to let it go."

The only thing the Devil has devoured is the Alliance.

The work of returning to the land of men and uniting all forces in the name of the Demon King is just beginning.

Even if the warrior is present in a way that suggests he's surrendered to the devil, people will project hope arbitrarily just because he's there.

The warrior is too big a symbol to be alive with the demon.

Die, or live the life of a fugitive.

There are only two choices.

So Ellen must disappear, if not die.

Charlotte looks at Ellen.

I don't think either of them trusted Reinhardt.

But Charlotte, who had been transformed into a demonic form, was able to be with him.

Charlotte has become too much of something else to be a raison d'être.

"As if there were no eternal battle."

Ellen sobs, and Charlotte holds her still.

"There will never be a goodbye......."

"......."

"Let's make sure we believe that."

I know it's just for later, not forever.

Charlotte pulled Ellen into a strong hug.
