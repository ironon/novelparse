            Episode 267.





Dinner at the Palace of Spring was spectacular.

We ate at a lavishly set table, assisted by maids of honor. As if fewer people weren't enough, I felt uncomfortable, but not awkward, eating with someone else by my side.

I ended up eating a lot of it, and Charlotte watched with amusement as I shoved it down my throat.

In the end, I ate so much more than I expected that Dyrus and Saviorin Tana, who were eating with me, were fed up.

"......No, do you eat that much?"

"When am I going to try this?"

Charlotte quits Temple.

Bertus is irrelevant.

In the end, I didn't know anything about what happened here. Nor would Charlotte tell me why she was leaving Temple.

Charlotte was giving a warning.

If anything happens to me, it won't involve Bertus, so don't do anything stupid and risk a crisis.

Although even that is likely to be false.

It was clear that there was something strange about Charlotte's situation, but she wasn't going to get an answer.

After dinner, we had tea together and talked about things.

If the situation is too serious, people will talk about something lighter.

If you start talking about a heavy topic, you're going to get sucked into that one topic, and you're not going to be able to say anything.

That's exactly what we did.

I had to get back soon, as we were going to have dinner.

I don't want to go back yet, and the idea of sleeping here might work for Charlotte, but not for Savior Tana.

Charlotte said goodnight, saying she would get ready for bed.

"Goodbye, Reinhardt. Lord Tana will see you off."

With that routine greeting.

Soon, Tana, the savior, approached to see me off - not so much to see me off as to make sure I was on track.

"Reinhardt."

"Ah, yes. Lord Saviolin."

Saviolin Tana called me.

"Tana is fine."

I nodded at her stern words.

"Yes, Tana."

"I didn't mean to leave out ......."

"Yes, Lord Tana."

The situation is serious.

This guy is kind of cute.

Ellen is real.

"Follow me. I need to check something out."

Before letting me out of the palace, she seemed to have some business with me.

I wonder if he's seeing me off and not Darius because he has something to check.

She led me off to somewhere in the palace.

What appears to be a smoke screen.

The lights were on, but there were no people anywhere. She suddenly raised her sword.

"Take it."

It was a little creepy, but eventually she grabbed the sword and handed it to me.

"No big deal, let's see how you do."

"......Suddenly?"

"I've been wondering about the future of the Empire you mentioned. We were at a banquet at the time. I thought I'd check it out while I had the chance."

The world's strongest man wants to clash swords. I'm pretty sure she doesn't mean anything by it. But when she hands me her sword, it's bare.

There were no other weapons in the training hall. There's no way Charlotte would be practicing swordsmanship here.

"Oh, I see."

When I glared at her, she looked at her bare hands.

"Don't worry."

-Woof

In her bare hands, blue mana began to coalesce and take the form of a sword.

It's not even an auror blade that projects magic onto a sword and adds to it.

I've gotten to the point where I can make a sword out of nothing but magic.

Superhuman, even beyond superhuman.

Saviolin Tana, the Swordmaster beyond the Swordmaster.

No, but you're giving it to Mr. Sun.

"No, what if we summoned something like that?"

"Don't worry. It's a bit of a hard wooden sword right now."

As if a child could know any better, she summoned an Auror Sword and pointed it at me.

"Oh, that's a different story."

"Do something."

"Yes."

Not knowing what else to do, I approached her with Tana's sword in hand.

Her shoulders, her steps, change in response to my movements, even though I'm not touching her. She reads my movements before I've even taken a defensive stance, as if she's gauging the gap and knows how I'm going to attack.

Feeling like I'm going to get stuck the moment we cross swords, I back off a bit again and gauge the distance.

This has never been possible before.

However, once I realized my 'gut feeling', it became possible.

Mood is the most deceptive of the many traits I've received.

Of course, a warrior's bloodline or divine spirit can be tremendous, but the deceitfulness of Qigong lies in its generality.

It feels like it's always on, and not just for certain situations.

In this situation, your opponent's movements are more visible. Not readable, but more subtle.

By looking at your opponent's prior moves and reacting to yours, you can get a good idea of what to expect.

It's not a special power.

It's just that I can now see what Ellen sees.

After practicing long enough, I can do what I see, aided by the trait.

As I adjust my stance and the trajectory of my sword, she follows suit.

We hadn't even clashed swords once, and it felt like we'd already had five fights.

If I go in, I get blocked. So I try another way, and then they try another way, and then I try again.

In that iteration.

The opponent's shoulder, stride, and sword grip.

It constantly makes small posture changes to anticipate combat.

"......."

"......You're not kidding."

She probably saw what I saw at a much higher level than I did. That's why it's not a battle, it's a competition.

She nods. She looks at me.

I don't know why, but.......

This is Ellen, and she can read people. Ellen often has no idea what she's thinking in the beginning, but this person is just there.

"It's not even close.

'I heard you've been learning the sword for less than a year.'

"Even if you were taught by a genius.

"Is this possible?

"What kind of talent is this?

"I hear you've got some kind of enchantment?

"You said you had superpowers, right?

"What the hell.

"He's scared.

"Why don't we ask them to come to Chanapelle?

"I want it.

"But it's taking so long to graduate.

That seems to be the general idea.

What is it? Why do I feel like I'm the only one who can read minds?

-Snarl

"That's it. I don't think we need to look any further."

In the end, she summoned her Auror Sword back without ever crossing swords with me. I politely returned the sword to her. She looked at me with her mouth set tightly shut, as if her thoughts were complicated by all sorts of things.

I suddenly realize that I want Ellen to be this big.

"I don't know if you're the future of the empire, but I'm beginning to think Effinghauser wasn't wrong."

"Is that a compliment?"

"I'm telling the truth."

This person.

Not only Ellen, but also Effinghauser. Age wise, of course.

She looks at me with her sword sheathed.

"Follow me."

Without another word, she left the performance hall and walked out of the Palace of Spring.

A garden at night, full of flowers. The gardeners were all gone. They must have gone home.

-currrrr

"Looks like it's about to rain."

Suddenly, an ominous thunderclap rumbled in the rainy sky.

I can't believe how long it's been since the sunset, and how suddenly it's faded.

She handed me one of the umbrellas.

But she wasn't wearing an umbrella.

"Don't you use it?"

"Not much."

It looked like it was about to rain, but she walked through the palace gardens as if it didn't matter.

The garden was huge, and it took me three months to get through it.

There were no guards anywhere in these palaces and gardens.

Saviolin Tana's mere presence replaces a large number of guards already in place.

Even some of the non-users of the palace seemed to have already left.

In this vast palace, Charlotte showed me the servants' and maids' quarters, which I didn't go into, but I'm pretty sure were empty.

How many steps you took.

-Tuduk

It's raining.

I opened the umbrella, but she just stood in the rain. I tried to put it on her, but she said enough and walked away from me.

She walked through the rain in silence. It was enough to tell that she was in a bad mood.

She and I walked through the palace gardens on a rainy spring day. The tram stop was still a long way off.

Suddenly, she opened her mouth.

"The king says you are the one who can take his secrets to the grave."

"...... Did you?"

"Yes, and he said he was a benefactor and a friend who had done you a lot of good, so you could tell him a few of your secrets."

Apparently, that's what they said in private.

Your own secrets.

Eventually.

The ending I least wanted.

Bertus, and nothing else. Charlotte's own problems.

"This, then, is highly unusual. You, a complete stranger, are to learn the secrets of the imperial family, but only by the will of the Empress, and it is not for me to decide, so keep what you are about to hear to yourself, for if it is revealed, your life and mine will be in jeopardy."

With ample warning, Saviolin Tana speaks.

"The Palace of Spring is currently closed to all outsiders. And it's not just outsiders, most of the palace's personnel are on standby outside, except for those who can be trusted."

When Charlotte didn't say anything herself, she meant for us to hear it from Savior Tana's mouth.

Charlotte gave me her secret, part of it.

"That is why, when the king brought you to me, I and Ser Dyrus were taken aback. Keep in mind that what was said between me and the King was circumstantial, not political. I have nothing to do with anything that comes from politics."

"......Yes."

Saviolin Tana.

It's only the Emperor's power, and she's not involved in politics at all, as she has a big business card as the head of the Charnapelle. It's not her path, she says.

"You must be a superhero."

"Yes."

"Then you know more than most about the dangers of superpowers, don't you?"

"Yes."

"Your psychic power is one of those dangerous ones. It's the kind of power that's hard to control, and that's why it can't be revealed to the public. Until now, you've been focusing on controlling your powers."

Charlotte's superpower.

My only prediction is that it's an offensive ability, and that it's taking it easy because it's the kind of power that shouldn't be revealed.

"I can't go into details. However, both the Imperial Family and you are having difficulty controlling your powers, which is why it is becoming difficult for you to live in the Temple any longer."

"It's ......."

Dangerous and uncontrollable psychics are removed.

Charlotte's power is that kind of power, and it could end up putting other students at Temple in danger.

So Charlotte can no longer come to the temple.

Charlotte soon quits Temple.

It could be a month from now, it could be next week, it could be today.

If this is true, then Charlotte's statement that Bertus is irrelevant is true.

That said.

The story of the death of a man in the Palace of Spring can be found at.......

In other words, someone died because Charlotte's powers got out of control.

Murder.

It was the reason why Charlotte was returning to the Imperial Palace instead of her dormitory.

"Today was unusual in many ways, and don't think you'll be able to visit the Palace of Spring in the future."

It's not a power struggle, it's Charlotte disappearing from the Temple because she failed to control her powers.

Before that.

What are Charlotte's powers?

Why the hell is Saviolin Tana here.

Why did my mood send me an alert today.

-Flash!

-curl!

In a flash of lightning, a flash of light, and a flash of light, I look up at Tana, the viola.

The raindrops running down her cheeks as she walked aimlessly in the rain were like tears.

"If Charlotte completely fails to control her ability....... what happens?"

"I have no reason to tell you."

Saviolin Tana says without looking at me.

Her expression was as serious as mine.

She looked like she was trying to decide something.

You're committing to something you don't want to commit to.

Saviolin Tana.

Why is the strongest man in the world single-handedly in charge of guarding this palace?

Why you're alone.

As far as I can tell, the only other guard besides her is Dyrus.

"If Charlotte gets out of hand, you're here to take over."

-Flash!

In a flash of light, Savior Tana squinted.

My intuition sent me a strong warning today. I was still feeling those red flags.

That said.

It was going to be about Charlotte dying today.

By the hand of Saviolin Tana.





第 268页





Saviolin Tana is staying at the Palace of Spring to deal with Charlotte in the event of an emergency.

It wasn't about Charlotte's safety, it was about Huang Sheng's safety.

It was clear.

"Save your words, Reinhardt, I don't have much patience."

In the rain, Saviolin Tana said.

Even if you were her friend, it was presumptuous to say that you were tasked with killing her. Was she standing out in the rain because she wanted to torment herself?

I do not know the relationship between Charlotte and Saviolin Tana. But it's a job that requires touching the body of the most noble of men, especially the Emperor.

It's a direct order from the Emperor, and I'm sure Charlotte accepts it.

But if you're in the position of having to do that command yourself, you'll feel like hell.

Something will happen today. But that's just a gut feeling warning, not a guarantee.

Before I knew it, the Palace of Spring was slipping away.

I shouldn't go back to the template.

I can't leave Charlotte behind.

But how.

Neither Charlotte nor Savior Tana would allow me to stay here at The Palace of Spring. I have crossed too many lines. I have already allowed too much by being Charlotte's friend.

We don't know if Bertus knows about this, but if he does, he's probably not paying attention to Charlotte. There's no point in messing with a competitor who'll just fade away.

I was already getting close to my stop.

"I'm sure you know the entrance to the palace, and I'd love to take you there, but I can't be gone for long."

"Yes, sir. Thank you, Lord Tana."

Normally, I'd have to make sure I was leaving the palace properly, but this was a special case.

She drove me to my stop and then headed back to the Palace of Spring.

I am not allowed to stay.

There was no one at the stop. Everyone who was supposed to go home had already gone home. They didn't want anyone to see Charlotte's condition. The Palace of Spring is operating with a minimum of people.

Now, even the least of them have been bitten, except for Dyrus.

I don't want anyone to see Charlotte die at the hands of Chief Chanapelle, just in case.

This means that right now, the Palace of Spring is very poorly defended.

Is it possible to secretly watch what's going on?

The Palace of Spring would be her domain. Is it possible to hide my presence from her senses and infiltrate the Palace of Spring to observe the situation?

Whether you can or not, you should.

Near the palace in the dreary spring that has bitten people far and wide.

Now it was time to mess up again.

Not for me, but for Charlotte.

Just as you did when you first fell into this world.

Just as I had gambled my life away at Demon Castle, I had to gamble my life away at Yellow Castle.

I can't stand by and watch the first life I saved slip away like this.

A fall rainy night in the dark.

Saviolin Tana is a nervous wreck. But not the kind of nerves that make you wary of your surroundings.

She's probably focused solely on Charlotte. The depression and confusion she feels for herself also seems pretty deep.

My self-implication there.

I don't know if it's possible or not to do this after the fact, but I'll try.

Then, one more thing.

Use 'retire'.

Saviolin Tana is unaware of my infiltration of the Palace of Spring.



[It takes 2,000 achievement points to cause that event].



It's not an unlikely event, but it's not cheap either.

In the past, this would have been enough to buy a talent. With this score, I have imprinted the talent of Self-Suggestion.

A combination of circumstances and conditions make it possible to fool the grandmaster's senses, at least for the moment.

Your current achievement score is 5,930 points.

If I could have Charlotte today, I would have spent it, even if I had to spend all of these points, and if I didn't have enough, I would have borrowed it.



[Use 2,000 achievement points].



When Saviolin Tana disappeared beyond the gardens, I left my stop and headed back to the Palace of Spring.

Place the umbrella among the flowers in the garden, and also use self-implication.

No one can feel me.

Strong implication.

My self-implication is even more powerful in these real-world situations.

It responds to my tension and desperation.

I can't let Charlotte die. My sense of urgency that something is going to happen today has allowed me to do things I wouldn't normally be able to do.

I succeed in infiltrating the Palace of Spring.

Confidence I have mixed beliefs.

I don't know if I'm really going away, but the rain actually dampened the noise and I moved very carefully.

I've created a situation where she doesn't notice me by retreating, but if I suddenly lunge and grab her by the hindquarters, she'll definitely notice.

What's hidden is only a pretense.

Don't be lulled into a false sense of security.

I approached the distant Palace of Spring again.

In the cold rain, the petals were falling, battered by raindrops.

-shoot

Tana on her way home in the fall rain.

I followed in the rain.



* * *



Saviolin Tana was not aware of her surroundings.

As I suspected, she appeared to be in a state of mental overload due to the gravity of her assignment.

As we walked, we would stop and stare at the Palace of Spring.

I couldn't tell what he was thinking.

But in front of me, in front of Charlotte, I could feel a deep sadness in her back that she hadn't shown.

I didn't expect to meet Saviolin Tana before the events of the Gate, and I only had a vague idea of her history, but I didn't flesh out the details.

Saviolin Tana did not participate in the Great Demon War. Or, more accurately, she did not participate.

The Emperor has tethered her to the ecliptic in the name of ensuring that the most powerful force remains to defend it.

You didn't use your power where you needed it most.

That's a big part of her sense of debt and guilt.

She trained Ludwig to be a bully, but only because of the special circumstances of the world's peril, not because her heart was evil.

Saviolin Tana dies saving Ludwig.

He apologizes to Ludwig for all his harsh behavior.

On the outside, she's a cold and distant person, but on the inside, she's anything but.

Rather plain.

He's just an ordinary guy who was so strong that he had to carry a lot of weight.

Saviolin Tana is a sassy senior at EpinHauser.

After graduating from the Temple and joining the Chanapelle, she would have been a knight of the Empire for decades. She's even been nicknamed the Protector of the Empire.

As such, she would have had a lot to do with royalty.

What was his relationship with Charlotte like?

I don't know, but I could tell from her hesitant steps that she cared about Charlotte.

As I watched Savior Tana return to the Palace of Spring, I too entered the palace.

As I walked into the palace's entrance, I didn't feel any magical barriers.

I would have thought that if there was such a thing, my gut would have warned me, but I didn't feel it at all.

Even the guards, including magical barriers, have been disarmed or deactivated. Or even the wizarding staff that was in charge of such things has been evicted.

Just like you don't need a lock on your house if you don't have anything to steal.

The Palace of Spring, which even Sarkhegar could not infiltrate, had become all too easy to infiltrate under the shadow of death.

Thanks to Charlotte's guidance, I had a general idea of what was around the palace.

If it's been a few days, I might have forgotten about it, but I just heard about it.

The only people in this huge, empty palace are Savior Tana, Darius, and Charlotte.

The lights were on, but there was no one to see me.

-Rumble

It was an ominous sound, but now the thunder and rain would drown out my footsteps.

What am I supposed to do here. I don't know anything yet.

Vague confidence.

Because of that one unspeakable feeling, I infiltrated the Empress's palace, refusing to be told to go back.

If I'm caught in a bad situation, even with Charlotte's good graces, Savior Tana will not leave me alone.

If you get it wrong, you really die.

I moved in the palace's illumination, ducking into the few dark spots, moving in the shadows.

Strengthens hearing.

-Currrrr!

With enhanced hearing, thunder sounds deafeningly loud, and rain sounds more detailed.

Self-Suggestion is now Rank B. You succeeded in enhancing your magic power and have been training consistently since then, and your rank has increased.

Therefore, its utilization is increasing. Not only is the range of applications expanding, but the methods we've been using are becoming more and more effective.

It was natural to be able to distinguish the sound I wanted to hear from the noise. This had been possible before, but with greater granularity.

In the sound of the rain, I could even distinguish the slightly different texture of the water as it trickled down the ceiling of the palace.

It was easy to distinguish the sound of the viola tana walking in the sound field, and I could somewhat predict its distance from me.

We don't have a floor plan of the entire palace, but we have a general idea of the locations.

On the second floor, in the hallway on the left, Charlotte's bedroom is on that side. Saviolin Tana is heading there now.

I could make out the sound in the dark corner of the first floor hall.

This is probably due to the fact that the palace is completely silent. The only other sounds were thunder and rain.

-Your Highness?

-You're in.

-Yes.

Dyrus's voice cut in.

I heard the door open.

-Electricity, are you okay?

-No, not yet.

I could hear Charlotte's nonchalant voice.

Charlotte's superpower.

How dangerous is this power that the Emperor must kill the Empress, and how has Charlotte come to terms with it herself?

Because your powers went wild and killed people?

-Dalcock

I heard the door close, and I could hear no more sounds from inside.

Probably due to soundproofing.

We need to get a little closer.

Heading upstairs to the second floor, he checked to see if Darius had made it into Charlotte's bedroom, but there was no one in the hallway.

Just in case, I ducked into an alcove in the hallway and crept closer to Charlotte's bedroom.

Don't make a lot of noise.

I've managed to keep Saviolin Tana from detecting my presence, but don't put too much stock in that.

You're fooling people you would never normally fool.

The closer I get, the more I fantasize about Tana the viola suddenly leaping out and grabbing me by the throat.

The rain should have chilled me to the bone, but my nerves made me feel feverish.

I'm breaking out in a cold sweat.

The good news is, they can't work magic.

If I had noise canceling on, I wouldn't have heard it at all. As I got closer to Charlotte's bedroom, I could detect a voice, very faint, coming from inside the room.

-Yet....... Don't remember?

-Ne.......

I could hear Tana's worried question and Charlotte's depressed answer.

What do you mean you don't remember?

-I think the time is coming, and when it does, please don't hesitate. Lord Tana.

-That will not happen. Surely, there must be a way to resolve Your Highness's condition....... The imperial family is searching as best they can.

The imperial family tries to find a way, but I can already hear the hopelessness in Savior Tana's tone.

-I don't think I'll be able to figure it out before my condition becomes more serious.

Charlotte was negative, and Darius and Tana couldn't deny it.

-Sire, we still need to find the child.......

-Please, please. I don't know how many times I've said it, don't talk about him.

Charlotte muttered nervously at Dyrus's words.

If it's him, he's probably referring to me.

Dyrus thinks that if he finds me, I might know how to make Charlotte's condition better? Why on earth?

If Charlotte's superpower is dangerous, what does that have to do with me?

The ominous forebodings and numerous hints were increasingly leading me to imagine things I didn't want to think about.





第 269页





-Your Majesty, I have heard stories about the child, but....... If that child can improve your condition, I must meet him at least once, I promise you. Even if the child knows nothing, I will protect his safety with my honor. Where is the child?

-I don't know, I don't know, the sealer doesn't know, the kid doesn't know where he is in the end, so it's all pointless.

Charlotte had said that she and I were the only ones who had a clue about Bali.

For some reason, you didn't tell the vassals about my whereabouts.

Did it have something to do with what Charlotte was going through, and Charlotte is no longer in contact with Valerie because she thinks I might be in danger?

It is very likely that Charlotte's powers are not superpowers.

If it's just a superpower that's dangerous, there's no reason for it to offer to find me.

-I have made a vow, Lord Tana. If I ever get blood on my hands again, kill me.

......In the end.

When someone died in the Palace of Spring, it was Charlotte's doing.

The power ran wild, and Charlotte killed people.

And you don't remember it.

-......charge.

-Promise.

-......No promises.

-Promise me, please.

Savior Tana gave no answer to Charlotte's begging for death.

The conversation is over.

I quickly hid in the instrument storage room at the end of the hallway on the right, next to the performance room. The door was open, and there were no instruments stored there. The only way I knew it was an instrument room was because it was full of what looked like racks.

The musicians would have taken all the instruments.

I thought about closing the door, but the sound of it might be detected, so I hid myself in the darkness of the room.

There is no use for Charlotte here, no use for Darius and Tana on the viola. The recital hall is empty, and this place is even more empty.

The vault was dark with no lights on, but that's not what I need, and all I need is sound.

This is actually a good thing.

-delay

Charlotte's bedroom door opened, and she heard Darius and Tana's footsteps.

-Wouldn't it be better to watch him sleep?

-to no avail. I've tied myself up and slept, but it was all for naught.

-......So, you're still not out of the palace yet?

-I guess, but....... Maybe it's just that you don't deviate.

-You mean you might show up at Tetra or the Winter Palace?

-I'm just guessing. We can only hope it's not possible.......

It's clear that they're talking about an event that's already happened, but I don't know what that event is, so I can't follow the conversation.

No restrictions on movement.

I only understood that it had something to do with Charlotte's abilities.

-By the way, is your shoulder okay?

-......It's okay, it's not a big deal, I was just caught off guard. I can still handle it.

-Will you not go to the priest?

-......It's dangerous for me to have a record of being treated by a priest. Your Highness could hurt me....... You know what I mean.

-Yes.

-His Majesty may be listening. I shall refrain from such talk.

-I see....... I was careless.

Charlotte's abilities went into overdrive or something, and Saviolin Tana was injured.

To the point of hurting her.

Is Charlotte's power enough to hurt Ms. Chanapelle?

They seem to have kept the very fact that Charlotte attacked Savior Tana a secret.

Charlotte's powers run amok, she loses her cool, and Savior Tana, acting defensively, finally realizes it's too late and kills her.

-um.......

As they neared the palace staircase leading down to the first floor, Savior Tana stopped walking.

-Is something wrong?

I feel it.

She's on guard.

-something.......

I held my breath.

Clear presence.

Saviolin Tana feels nothing. She wonders how much time has passed.

-You didn't sleep well, no big deal.

-Seventh?

-Is it a day....... No. Is it a week, I'm not sure.

-Don't you need to rest during the day?

-This is one thing, but I'm also the head of Chanapelle, and I don't have time for that.

-I see.......

Government by day.

Charlotte's bodyguard at night.

It seems like Saviolin Tana hasn't had a break at all in quite some time.

The two of them moved again, descending the stairs.

I didn't let out the breath I'd been holding.

More.

Get a little further away.

-Well done, Dyrus. Go back.

-Yes, sir....... But are you okay? You look tired.

-That doesn't mean you can't stay.

-I see.......

-Sorry. I didn't mean to be mean. I'm just a bit, well, sensitive.

-No, I didn't think of it that way at all.

-That's great, then. Get some rest, you've been through a lot.

-Well, hopefully nothing happens.

-Yes.

Darius left the Palace of Spring.

I thought the reason for reducing the number of people in the palace was so that no one would see Charlotte killed by Savior Tana, but there were other reasons as well.

It's also to prevent someone from being victimized by a rampaging Charlotte.

There are only three people left in the palace.

Me, Saviolin Tana, and Charlotte.

It would mean that my life could be in danger at any moment. ......

Should I leave the palace? I'm already in danger.

I didn't know if the red flags my gut was throwing up were for Charlotte or for my own safety.

I heard Saviolin Tana slump into a chair in the hall.

It's right to get out of here. Charlotte's powers are powerful, Tana can handle it, and I'm pretty sure I can't.

It's more likely to be you who's at risk.

-Rumble

You can't even get out in the first place.

Saviolin Tana sat in the hall that was now the entrance to the palace. As if to keep an eye on things.

-Pat!

The corridor was getting clearer as Saviolin Tana manipulated something.

No, the magic light also illuminated my instrument vault.

Saviolin Tana suddenly lit up the entire palace.

Any chance of escape under cover of darkness was gone.

If you want to leave, you have to leave while she's away.

As expected, the viola tana did not move.

I couldn't move either.

The die has already been cast.

Hoping that nothing will happen, but knowing that something will.

I held my breath.



* * *



It was a boring time.

However, it was a horribly nerve-wracking time.

I kept focusing on killing him with self-suggestion to avoid being picked up by Savior Tana's senses.

Saviolin Tana was frozen in place.

In a temple, my undo might be a problem.

If nothing happens, what excuse do I have for taking my time leaving the planet?

Secondary issues are starting to surface, but that's all for me and Charlotte to deal with once we get through the day.

It's already late at night.

It must have been past midnight.

Saviolin Tana has somehow managed to illuminate the entire palace, which is deserted.

As if to drive away the darkness.

The instrument closet I'm in is also lit, but it's a blind spot anyway. She didn't notice me.

What a boring time that was.

-pot

The lights in the Instrument Vault have gone out.

That wasn't all.

The light from the hallway also disappeared after a while.

We don't know how they control the lighting in the palace.

Saviolin Tana didn't move. Did she put out the fire?

Why turn off all the lights all of a sudden?

No.

It's not like she put out the fire.

As I cautiously poked my head out into the hallway, I saw a different sight.

The magic lights throughout the palace flickered and flickered, then went out one by one.

-Now....... Until this.......

Saviolin Tana's voice is a small monologue. It was a voice that sounded alarmed and afraid.

I can't think of anything other than Charlotte turning off the lights.

How this is possible.

Why are they doing this.

Unknown.

Saviolin Tana gets up from her seat and moves. The direction she's moving is toward Charlotte's bedroom.

I huffed and puffed, my whole body stiffening to avoid detection.

I don't want her to find me.

Now that I've used it to the point of retirement, a number of coincidences and events have intertwined to ensure that I will not be discovered. It would include the condition that I conceal my presence with all my might.

Going undetected is the future, but if I suddenly start screaming, you'll never know.

I have no intention of testing whether or not I can change a predetermined future.

You can't make a gamble you're already taking more risky.

-Charge!

-If you are awake, please answer!

Saviolin Tana calls out as she walks down the hall.

-Charge!

She heads to Charlotte's bedroom and calls out for her.

A springtime palace in the dark.

-Flash!

-currrrr

It was a rainy night, which made it even darker, and I could barely make things out without the occasional flash of brain light.

No, it's not the light from the lightning that's causing your eyes to adjust to the darkness. The light actually hinders your vision.

-Charge!

There was a cry of desperation from Saviolin Tana.

-delay

I heard Charlotte's bedroom door open.

-.......

There was no sound from Savior Tana, not even the sound of a door opening before she opened it.

If so, Charlotte is sleeping.

-And....... Gone.......

It's gone.

I could hear the tired, despairing voice in my head.

The moment.

-Flash!

"!"

I almost screamed for a moment.

In that moment, as the light bulb went off in my head, I saw something.

Something is in front of you.

was.

-currrrr

There was a moment of silence after the thunderstorm, followed by a clap of thunder that rattled the windows.

What is.

Now.

What's in front of me?

I squinted and stared ahead, but I couldn't make out the shape of the thing watching me in the darkness. I wasn't mistaken.

Something was definitely watching me.

Suddenly, something that wasn't there a moment ago is there.

-Flash!

Once again, the lightning bolt dispelled the darkness for a moment.

A shape appeared before my eyes, for a split second, and then it was gone.

I saw it clearly.

What geometry.

He was smiling at me.

Although she looks like Charlotte.

Something that was never Charlotte was watching me in the pitch blackness.

I couldn't see anything.

But the presence of the thing in front of me was palpable.

-H.

-hmph.

-hhhhh.......

-hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.......

'It's' eerie chuckle brushes the nape of my neck.

-Flash!

In my oblivion, I could see it properly.





Dark hair and eyes as black as the abyss.

And a red pupil with a vertical slit.

Well, more like the devil himself.
