            Episode 399.





Some people were accused of witchcraft.

The crowd was furious, and the guards stood in the way of the angry crowd, telling them not to impose private sanctions.

What happened in the three hours we were gone. They had all been executed.

It's not a small town, it's not even a small country, it's the capital of a country, and it's in a public square with a warp gate.

Those who had been accused of being satanists were dead, and the angry mob was screaming for their bodies to be burned.

We don't know if the Inquisitor arrived, branded them as heretics and executed them, or if the guards stepped in and hanged them.

However, this execution happened so quickly that it's unlikely it was done properly.

"It's crazy....... People are all......."

I knew something terrible would happen, but I didn't think it would go so far as to kill a man without a proper trial, so Olivia seemed to feel horror beyond disgust and contempt.

Fear is similar to anger.

Fear of the devil, then, becomes anger at one's neighbors and a search for scapegoats.

Olivia turned away from the gruesome execution and the angry crowd as she walked toward the investigation center.

"What the hell is the Royal House of Leviathan or the Order of the Giver doing?"

"......."

I couldn't say anything.

"No way, are you doing this on purpose?"

The royal family and the church did not do nothing. On the contrary, they may have enforced the situation.

You might say that they're just regular folks, not Satanists. The crowd might believe it, or they might not.

But if the scapegoat is not executed, the rage and fear will not subside. Indeed, whether or not they're actually Satanists, the anger is only temporarily quelled by their death.

The scapegoat was executed unusually quickly to give the crowd a sense that something had been resolved.

If an angry crowd becomes a mob, there will be great chaos. Releasing people who people suspect of being Satanists would in itself further inflame the crowd's anger.

Innocent people were killed to control the situation.

Olivia read between the lines.

Getting to the bottom of it is not the point.

Already, it was clear that this aimless violence of the panicked crowds in the aftermath of the demon attack would play a role in Olivia's hatred of humans.

"Are you going to leave this alone?"

Back at the Special Investigations Unit, Olivia asked Scotra Kelton, the head of the unit.

The middle-aged knight with the calm expression seemed to understand what Olivia was talking about.

"Ms. Olivia, I'm sure you know what you're talking about."

"I know this could be interference in internal affairs, and I know the Bureau doesn't have that kind of authority, but....... This is......."

No matter how disillusioned Olivia is with humans, she hasn't become someone who agrees to kill them indiscriminately.

"I realize that if left unchecked, this situation could turn into a massive riot, an indiscriminate hunt for infidels, but we're here to investigate the events of the demon raids, not to influence the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Levaina. We can't do anything else."

Olivia is not stupid. Of course she knows what Kelton is talking about.

But it's frustrating to see the insanity of heresy trials and hanging people in front of our eyes, and to know that this trend could continue for a while, or even turn into a riot, and not do anything about it.

However, special editions need to be operated within reason, and what's happening in Lazerne right now is clearly off-base.

So Olivia knows she's pushing Scotra Kelton's buttons.

But we can't leave this situation alone.

Olivia has enough humanity left in her to think like that.

"Of course, a few words of concern about the situation, even from someone like Levaina without special privileges, could have a significant impact."

Third in command of Shanapelle. That's already a good position for a king of a small country. Even now, he takes orders from the Empire and is in charge of field command. It's a bit of an interference in his internal affairs, but he doesn't mind.

"But the very act of me doing that would constitute interference in the internal affairs of an already sovereign state, so it wouldn't be Levaina that matters."

"The other empires....... other empires?"

"Yes."

You can interfere in the internal affairs of a Levaina. However, it can be very uncomfortable for other empires to know that you have interfered in their internal affairs. Even if it's a small country's sovereignty, it's still a violation of the sovereignty of an empire.

While all countries are part of an empire, an empire is ultimately a federation of many countries. Some empires are self-governing, such as the Ecliptic, but their vassal states have their own laws and sovereignty.

Worse, in this case, the Imperial investigators who have come to investigate the case are acting outside of their purpose, interfering in internal affairs.

Scotra Kelton's position was that there was too much at stake to take a stand, no matter how bad it was, and Olivia and I both understood that.

"Also, I don't think it's such a bad idea either. Throwing the truth at an angry crowd will only make them more angry. Sure, a few innocent people will die, but it'll blow over."

Scotra Kelton reads the report and makes a mark somewhere, rolling her pen as she goes.

He's right.

Letting scapegoaters know that they are innocent will only make them find another scapegoat or make them more angry. Anger needs to be resolved, even if the cause is wrong.

You can riot and face chaos, or you can find a scapegoat, kill a few, and settle down.

The Royal House of Levaina and the Cult have chosen a different path. Olivia stared at Scotra Kelton, who rolled her nib absentmindedly.

Rather than resenting his cold conclusion, Olivia seemed frustrated that she couldn't find an answer herself.

"Of course, I'm not authorized, but there is one person who is authorized to interfere in my internal affairs......."

He looks at me sheepishly.

"Mr. Reinhardt."

"It's ......."

"If you claim to be here as an agent of the imperial family, perhaps you could discuss the appropriate course of action with the House of Levaina."

"......I thought you said it was internal affairs interference?"

"That's assuming you're willing to take it. I have no intention of doing so, but Mr. Reinhardt may feel differently. He is not under my command, is he?"

You're a knight, but I'm semi-imperial with an imperial crest.

If the head of the Investigations Division talks to the royal family of Levaina, that's not part of the investigation, but if an imperial agent contacts the royal family and talks to them, that's part of the investigation. Of course, that's interference in internal affairs, but it's perfectly acceptable to talk to the royal family of Levaina.

However, in that case, not only will I be responsible for anything that happens because I ran my mouth, but so will the Imperial Family.

The Imperial Coat of Arms is more than just priority access to the warp gate.

It made sense to me why this would never be given away to anyone.

Why did Tana send me here.

I'm starting to get the picture.

If I could stabilize the chaotic situation in Leviathan, I would do so.

It wasn't life-threatening, but it would be an accomplishment if he succeeded.

It doesn't have to be a solution. Maybe it's to see how I react in the face of a big problem, not a small one.

But how?

No.

By the way, Empire, these assholes are pissing me off.

If you think about it, you're creating terrorism in a small southern country, and then when it comes to the aftermath, you're like, "I don't know," right?

Isn't that a situation where you're accusing the devil, and then you're asking me, the devil, to clean up that shit?



* * *



The Levainese capital, Raziern, was currently experiencing the aftermath of a demon raid: people were being driven mad by fear of demons.

The result is a method of extermination. Of course, it's mostly innocent people who have nothing to do with the cult who are actually hunted down and killed.

Knowing that they were innocent, the royal family and the Church seemed intent on sacrificing them to quell the outrage.

The devil was never in this place in the first place.

After all, it's only because Leviathan is a small country in the south that the Empire has sent revolutionary forces to kill it. Moreover, the Investigative Division is only thinking of covering up the incident, and the aftermath of the incident is unknown to me, as it could be considered interference in internal affairs.

It's an age-old truth that the horrors of the ruling class are unfathomable, but it's even more eerie now that it's so tangible.

The empire that created this situation and is sitting on its hands is terrible.

I'm horrified by the Levaina royal family and the Order of the Five Great Givers, who hang innocent victims to stabilize the situation.

It's also terrible to see a crowd that turns fear into anger and looks for a scapegoat, even when they know it's not going to happen.

"Hell wasn't anywhere else."

Guest room.

Olivia stood by the window, muttering grimly to herself as she listened to the distant shouts of the crowd.

In the days of the Demon Realm, fights were fought in specific areas of the Demon Realm, so the fights, battles, blood, and slaughter only happened there.

But now that the demonic world is gone, demons can infiltrate the human world, appearing and disappearing out of nowhere.

So people were being driven mad by the fear of an insubstantial enemy, the fear that they might be living and breathing near them.

So when they couldn't find an enemy in the form of a demon, they looked within for an enemy in the form of a human, and that was the Demon God. But even the demons were not here, so they could only suspect each other and hate each other.

"What are you going to do, Reinhard?"

At the moment, I'm the only one who makes less noise and has access to the royal family of Levaina. I could report this to the imperial court, but the general manager, a knight of Shanapelle, said I should just leave it alone.

Whether it's Charlotte, the Emperor, or Bertus, if they hear about this, they're going to tell you to leave them alone.

What am I different?

If you tell the scapegoaters that this person is not a Satanist, they won't believe you, and even if they do, they'll find other ways to vent their anger.

I suppose there's the option of banning private infidelity and imposing martial law to control the population.

But if an angry crowd starts a riot, that's an even bigger disaster. The riot could overthrow the royal family, and if you have to beat the crowd to quell the riot, that's a disaster, too.

It's a shame.

Scotra Kelton was right when she said that the least bloodshed is when innocent people are dying and things are quiet.

"Unless there's a real Satanist and they get caught or something, or the devil dies....... I don't know how to solve this without seeing blood."

I'm not exactly a genius, and politics is not my strong suit.

If I were to meet with King Levaina and do something presumptuous, what would I say? There's no way I'd have a pointed number.

Olivia stood at the window, staring down at the street.

She had grown to hate humans, but she couldn't sit back and watch innocent people die; she couldn't help but wonder if that nature would eventually go away somewhere.

"This is what happens when people are eaten by despair......."

It's not like I'm sure it's going to come back, and it didn't really do that much damage.

But the fear is not real, and it spreads among people.

The fear of the devil's name is circulated and reproduced among people, inflating it to insubstantial size.

It is, after all, a belief, just not called by that name. It's like when people who don't know about God say what God is like, and it becomes a common concept.

A belief in the name of the Devil is created among the people.

None of what they say looks like me, but people add flesh to the nebulous entity that is the devil, molding it into a shape of terror.

A new faith called the Devil, whose beliefs inspire nothing but fear and despair.

-Hunt down the Satanists!

It's probably all over the continent right now.

Raziern is overkill, but with demons nowhere to be found across the continent, people will turn to their human-formed enemies, the Demonists.

This is just the beginning.

A massive manhunt will be launched to identify and hunt down the cultists.

-Believe in Artorius!

-The hero will rise and defeat the devil!

And then, out of the blue.

Olivia looked from the window to my direction and cocked her head.

"......?"

"......?"

What did I just hear?

-The warrior Artorius will protect us!

"Are you sure I didn't hear you wrong, I thought you said Artorius?"

"Yeah....... That....... like that?"

No.

What kind of bullshit is this?



* * *



I thought I could understand people yelling at me about banishing Satanism, but Olivia and I heard something even more outlandish.

Trust Artorius?

Olivia and I immediately ran out into the street and grabbed the person screaming at us.

"Excuse me."

"Artorius will save us......!"

It was an elderly man who was shouting such bizarre things.

"What's going on?"

"What are you talking about? Trust Artorius?"

"You, too, can be saved by believing in the Champion......, and you need not fear the devil at all!"

He exclaimed, his face full of faith and belief. Olivia was puzzled, and so was I.

"No, Artorius is not that....... demon and....... died, didn't he?"

He shook his head at my stammering.

"Oh, you young man, you don't know what you're talking about! Arcturus is not dead, he's ascended! He's done great things like defeating demons and becoming a god ......! Yes, he's become a god, and now that the demons are back, it's only fitting that Arcturus should return to finish the job he started!"

No.

"You, too, believe in the Champion and wait for the salvation to come......!"

What the hell is this?

The old man turned away from us, frozen, and began to chant.

-Believe in Artorius!

-The time of salvation is at hand!

-Do not be afraid, for the warrior is coming!

Staring at the old man's back as he walked away, Olivia and I made eye contact.

"What is martial arts?"

"How do I know that......."

Things like demon hunting and stuff like that were still in the realm of possibility.

The emergence of an emerging religion that worships Lagan Artorius was so unexpected that it left us frozen in place.
