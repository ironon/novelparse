Edina Royal Palace meeting room.

There, seated were the four Gajus, with the exception of Lucinil.

"Your Highness."

"Long time no see. Great one."

Eleris claims to be my servant, but the other three are not my subordinates; they help me as much as they can, but only to the extent that they cooperate with me, not to the extent that they submit to me.

Of course, Lerouen, Galarsch, and Antrian had all moved their clans to the Edina Archipelago.

Part of it was their desire to help me, but it was also because they couldn't leave their clans on a continent that had been torn apart by the Gate.

Now, the Lord Vampire's clans were also a very important part of my military power.

Vampires are usually mages, and the Lord Vampires, who can withstand the sun, were and still are a vital crutch for my rule across the archipelago.

Magic.

Without that crucial power, I would not have been able to provide shelter for so many refugees, construct new buildings, or grow food for them as quickly as I did.

Basically, humans are very afraid of vampires.

But when humans see vampires using magic to farm, growing crops and scrambling to feed themselves, they wonder what the hell this is all about.

Humans provide blood without being vampirized, and vampires provide food for humans to eat.

It's a bit of a symbiotic relationship, but what the heck, I've got grape juice down my throat.

So in reality, the Friday, Thursday, and Saturday clans didn't seem to mind the situation.

So the vampires, the most important part of my support base and my collaborators, were looking at me.

"Your Majesty, it seems that word of this place is spreading across the continent, albeit very slowly."

Eleris said.

Eleris worked mostly on her own.

I traveled from continent to continent, destroying as many warp gates as I could, doing what I could to end the gate crisis once and for all.

"Rumor?"

"Yes, we don't know if it's coming from refugees who refused to join us or not, but we've seen anecdotal stories spreading about paradise in the south."

The continent is a mess.

The Empire is busy doing what it does best, so it does not yet know of my presence in the far, far south.

Even if you know, you probably can't afford to do anything about it right now.

"Right now, there are only rumors that it's somewhere in the south, but no one knows for sure....... In the long run, powerful forces, including the Empire, will be searching the southern lands, possibly reaching Port Mokna."

"......Yes."

Port Mokna, our continental base.

It's a small, tiny dot on the continental map, but it can be a big deal if the Empire realizes it's not only unharmed, but has a large military presence.

If anyone in Port Mokna were to be captured, the Empire would know that a demon had taken up residence in the far, far south.

The Edina Archipelago will not be out of the Empire's sight for long.

The Gate Crisis has destroyed much of the foundation of humanity, but it will end one day.

That was the end of Elise's report.

"We're almost done installing water and sewage in the evacuation centers, and we're almost done clearing the large agricultural fields in the south, so now we just need to sow, and we've started building ships to transport supplies to other areas."

I nodded at Lerouen's words.

Thursday's Gazoo.

I don't know if it has much to do with it, but the vampires of Thursday were well versed in alchemy and other creature-related magic.

I wouldn't have thought to use it for farming.

One of the big advantages I have is that I can use a lot of my mages, who are a very high quality workforce, to produce or farm materials.

An empire can't do this.

There's only so much territory you can defend, and you never know when the monsters of the gates will roam the continent and invade your city.

It's a land safe from the gate, and you can focus all your energy on providing for your people.

"There's an abandoned magic stone mine near Fort Mokna. It can be mined, but transportation is expected to be difficult, so I would like the Thunder King to lead a force to transport it."

"Yes, I'll do that."

Magic Stones.

This is an absolutely scarce resource right now.

Basically, anything from streetlights to real-life magic tools. There wasn't a single thing that didn't have a magic stone in it.

The Edina Archipelago is not self-sufficient in magic stones.

With lanterns to light the night, the crime rate in the evacuated areas would be greatly reduced. As such, Galarsh had already secured a number of shuttered mines and quarries that served to supply the Edina Archipelago with magic stones.

Once you have enough magic stones, you can drastically improve your quality of life.

With the population of the Edina Archipelago exploding, it's safe to say that there's an infinite supply of magic stones.

Eleris, Leruen, and Galarsh have spoken.

Finally, Antirrhinus looks at me.

"Great One, it appears that the Empire has succeeded in destroying about 8% of the warp gates in existence."

"I see."

Antirrhinus is in charge of espionage.

As much as I've tried to rescue civilians here, and as many times as I've gone to deal with monsters and gates in the southern part of the continent myself, it's the Empire that's going to be the key force in the end.

We had already heard that the forces operated by Saviolin Tana were focused solely on destroying the warp gates of numerous cities.

Eight.

If all warp gates are destroyed, the gate event is over.

But there's also the long and arduous task of dealing with all the monsters that are already out there.

However, it will get harder and harder.

The fewer warp gates we have, the more powerful monsters will pour out of the ones that remain.

The end of the gate crisis is near, which means that each gate is becoming more and more dangerous.

"In addition, the Empire has succeeded in restoring all of its provinces, including thirty major cities, and is well on the defensive. From here on out, we will likely be assisting other surviving empires in restoring their territories. With this, I think it's safe to say that the Empire has fully regained the function of a state."

The Edina Archipelago is safe, but even on the continent where monsters rage like waves, the Empire has reclaimed territory lost to the monsters and restored full statehood.

I was reminded of the power of humanity.

I don't know if this is really good news for me, but Antony smiled softly.

"However, the population concentrated in the Ecliptic Gradient is now exceeding some forty million; large refugee camps have formed on the outskirts of the Gradient, the size of which the Empire is currently unable to handle; the streets of the refugee camps are filled with rags and filth, and the bodies of starving refugees are left unattended."

It makes sense that the ecliptic would attract people, and that was the case in the original.

This creates a vast law enforcement void.

The population of the ecliptic alone is comparable to the total population of the Edina Archipelago.

The empire cannot provide for them all, cannot control them, cannot guarantee their safety and livelihood.

The monsters that roam the continent will attack.

The Gate crisis was coming to an end, but other problems would plague the Empire.

Antirrhinus continues.

"In addition, distrust of the Five Great Houses has reached a fever pitch, and the Mercenary faith, which claims the warrior Ellen Artorius as its prophet, is believed by the overwhelming majority of refugees."

Forced Warrior.

Now that it's been revealed that I'm the Devil and the cause of this mess, Ellen is being forced to become the prophet of the Dragon Cult.

Antirrhinus laughs.

As if I'm enjoying the fact that I'm doing this for humanity, that I'm the object of hatred for the vast majority of humanity.

"The vast majority of refugees, as well as a significant number of existing Zodiac residents, are believers in Mercenaryism, and their frustration is reaching a boiling point."

"Complaints?"

What's wrong with believing that Ellen is going to kill me, since that's what martial arts is all about.

Is this a complaint about Ellen not killing me? Ellen probably doesn't even know where I am.

"The Dragon Cultists want to scapegoat the Empress, who is the Devil's inner circle."

"......."

Oh, I see.



* * *



I had heard the stories about Charlotte. Stories of Charlotte's uncanny powers had spread.

It's not like I'm actually in league with Charlotte or anything, but the hatred for me is out of control and I'm still on a continent somewhere.

They're looking for a scapegoat they can drag in front of them.

As such, Charlotte, who had been kidnapped by the Demon King, and who had been close to me, was known as a priority Demon King contact.

It's ridiculous.

Ellen is a poor heroine who has been tricked by the devil all this time.

Charlotte was a collaborator with the Devil.

Antirrhinus continues to laugh.

He's fully cooperating with me, but at this point I really want to punch him in the face.

Crazy loyalists who are happy when their lord is unhappy.

Antirrhinus says.

"The Imperial House has been consistent in its staged responses to the demands of every crowd, but this could turn into a distrust of the Imperial House in the future. Perhaps the Imperial House is also in league with the Devil, and that's why they won't release Charlotte de Gradias, or something like that."

"......Yes."

People believe what they want to believe.

Why do you not kill the Empress when you should?

You're all in this together.

The story of why the Empress must die has already been told. You want to believe you're the devil's messenger, so let's go with that.

So they'll try to make everyone who tries to protect her into something they don't deserve.

If the martial and commoner demands for the death of the Empress continue, and the Empire continues to stage a response, there will be a riot at some point.

Killing the Empress solves nothing.

People are just pissed off.

I'm angry and frustrated and sad.

I can only hope that someone dies carrying this anger.

It's not the devil who doesn't know where he is, it's the maiden who is where she knows she is.

"Emperor Bertus must one day stand his queen before a crowd."

Bertus as Emperor.

An emperor must defend his empire.

You can't and shouldn't trade the reputation of the Empire for Charlotte's life.

As if against my will, the gate eventually happened.

Regardless of Bertus's wishes, Charlotte will end up at the stake at some point.

You must trade the life of the Empress for the wrath of the people.

"Great One, what would you do?"

Antirrhinus smiled broadly.

Charlotte cursed me.

I told him to die the most miserable death in the world.

I don't really hold a grudge. The misunderstandings I'd built up with Charlotte were enough to make me say that.

I wonder if Charlotte still hates me.

We don't know about that.

Once when escaping from the Demon Castle.

Once in the Palace of Spring.

I saved Charlotte's life twice.

So, whether Charlotte still hates me or not, I'm going to do it a third time against her will.

I swore I would.

I'll go through any night, I'll go through any hate, I'll go through any malice.

I will save Charlotte.

"I'm going to go see what's going on."

There's no telling when that will be, but I will.



* * *



Teleport is a higher-level spell, and Mass Teleport is an even higher-level spell.

The only ones with enough horsepower to cast it are the Lord Vampires, including Eleris.

Herriot could cast top-tier magic with the aid of power cartridges, but he didn't use them because he couldn't get enough of them.

As such, only a small number of people can immediately return to the Edina Archipelago from the continent via mass teleportation, or be deployed to the continent.

-Pow!

For example, unless you're Liana de Grants, who is currently teleporting with Elise to the center stage of the royal castle, the number of people who can teleport to and from the castle is extremely limited.

The Lord Vampires of the Senate aren't here all the time, and they all have other things to do.

The scantily clad Riana looked at me and shook her head.

"Are you getting any sleep?"

"Aren't you going to sleep?"

Liana, now more commonly known by her nickname, King Brain.

The shield that protects Fort Mokna, and the mightiest spear that saves those chased by monsters.

"Ugh, I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat and talk."

"Yeah."

Despite the small talk, Riana has killed the most monsters and saved the most people out of all of us.



* * *



Herriot, myself, and Riana sat in the dining room of the palace and talked.

A king's meal isn't exactly fancy. But it's not too impoverished either.

To put it bluntly, the meals served at the temple were not comparable to what we have now in terms of quality and quantity.

"There are no monsters or people around Mokna anymore. You have to go really far to see a monster's tail. I don't think we can do much more here."

Scouring the neighborhoods of fixed strongholds for people fleeing or hiding from monsters is no longer fruitful.

So, in the beginning, we had a huge number of refugees on the ships, and today, we only have eight hundred refugees.

"They say there's another port city about a hundred and seventy kilometers west of Mokhna, so we might as well secure that and base our search and rescue operations there."

"Okay, let's get a quote."

We'll take another stronghold, forward base it, and do rescues and monster exterminations from there. Riana asks, wolfing down the sausage.

"So the question is whether to ditch Mokna or keep it, what do you think?"

"Hmmm....... Having two forward bases doubles our chances of being spotted by the Empire, so it seems a bit unnecessary to keep an obsolete Mokna."

"But it would be a waste to throw away all the supplies and infrastructure that's there."

"Sure."

Putting aside the debate of whether or not to retire Mokna, I've been convinced of the need for a new forward base.

"By the way, ....... Are you sure you want to go directly to the Empire?"

This time, Herriot asked me.

"Empire? What are you talking about?"

Riana shook her head, not sure what I was trying to do.

"Lately....... there's a bit of a stir over there about executing the Empress. So he's going to see for himself what's going on in the empire."

"......?"

At my words, Riana shook her head.

"Wow....... I tend to think that you're the most sociopathic of the sociopaths, but....... Isn't this the first time you've crossed the line? It's bad enough that you're taking care of humans, but now you're taking care of an Imperial Empress who's an enemy?"

Of all of us, Riana is the one who wants to see the Empire fall and the House of Gradias destroyed.

Riana wasn't actually that close to Charlotte.

So it's no wonder she's so worried about the Empress of the Aptitude Nation that she's upset when I tell her I'm going on a scouting trip to the Empire.

She had heard everything that had gone on between Charlotte and me, so it was no wonder that she looked like she was about to drop a crane at my decision.

Well.......

Is this bullshit?

I'm not sure.

"Dude, I've been working a job I'm not cut out for for two years now. You know?"

"Playing king?"

"Yeah, I'm tired of sitting in my seat all day listening to you. It drives me crazy."

"Well, you've been pretty good so far, and on the subject of demons, what the hell are you going to do if the king isn't your cup of tea?"

"It's something I've done reluctantly, and it's not something I'm cut out for, but I'd much rather be out on the continent slaying monsters, and sometimes when I see the fungus next door begging me to punish him for breaking my bowl, I'd rather leave the city and tear his thrush to shreds."

"Oh, I forgot to mention......."

Herriot was next to me at the time, so he knew what I was talking about.

I've gotten a lot of whiners asking me to do something for them.

It's enough to make you panic that you're going to die of high blood pressure.

At my words, Riana looked at me, a bit stunned.

"Oh....... You're so stressed, you......."

"I don't want to say this to you because you're on the front lines, but I'm sick of this shit, I can't do it."

Two years is a lot.

It's not something I have the aptitude for or talent for. I did it because I had to, not because I liked it.

And the more you do it, the more it chips away at your mind.

Harriet can take over for a while. And I'm sure she's better at it than I am. But it's a lifetime job, and I can't pass it on.

And Herriot had so much more to do as a magical expert than just a scribe.

So, you need someone who can sit for the rest of their life.

I'm going to make a regent out of somebody who's more talented than me and who's going to do a better job, and I'm going to make them do it for life.

"I don't know how I'm going to do it, but when I get a chance, I'm going to bring Charlotte over and let her play king for me."

At this point, I'm not saving Charlotte.

Charlotte is saving me.

You've saved my life three times.

It's okay to try to get paid now, right?
