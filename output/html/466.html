            Episode 466.





The execution of the Empress would solve quite a few problems for the Empire.

The first is to temporarily defuse the anger of the scapegoating crowd.

The execution of the Empress deflects the angry attention that has been directed at the Five Great Patriarchs, thereby diverting negative attention away from the Five Great Patriarchs.

The imperial powers that don't know the truth also distrust the empire because they see the empire wrapped around a demon-cursed princess, so they can be relieved of that distrust as well.

Crucially, this resolves any suspicions that the Imperial Family may have been involved with the Devil due to the circling of the Empress so far.

The execution of Charlotte de Gradias may not have solved anything physically, but it did solve a political problem.

Of course, that's only a stopgap measure.

In the end, the problems would fester again, only temporarily sealed, because the demon that represented the hatred was not gone.

After all, even if the Empire actually executes the Empress, it's only buying time.

It may be that the division and fall of empires is predestined, only postponed indefinitely.

In the Empire, the Emperor is the only one who knows the true intentions behind this.

People are excited about the idea of executing two of the devil's henchmen together, but they have no idea what the real intentions are.

However, there are a few people who can guess what the emperor is really up to without him saying it.

"Do you think ...... Reinhardt will come?"

"Right."

Ellen found nothing to say to Bertus's words.

Reinhardt will or won't come.

It's coming, it's bound to come.

Ellen thinks so.

But I know it's going to happen, so I'm wondering if it's right to use Reinhardt.

The same people who didn't believe in Reinhardt now believe in Reinhardt, so it's shamelessly exploitative.

Even though it wasn't her job, Ellen couldn't put the question out of her mind.

Reinhardt will come.

This time, as always, he will try to save Charlotte.

I envy you that.

"......."

I know it's unreasonable to hope for that.

Ellen couldn't get the thought out of her head.



* * *



Bertus created the opportunity to get Charlotte, not me.

Plus, unexpectedly, we had the chance to get Rusinil and Sarkegar back as well.

If you take Charlotte with you, you'll eventually have to show yourself in this situation.

It's a risk I'm taking, and when I execute an important person, I may end up having to deal with a loss of trust in the empire for losing that person to the devil.

Bertus is willing to risk it on his own terms, and I am willing to risk it on my own terms to save the Empress, Lucinil, and Sarkegar from the heart of the Empire.

Three weeks later, on a Sunday.

Needless to say, the best of the Empire are scrambling to resolve the Gate situation.

So the overflowing crowds at the execution grounds and the troops guarding the massive firing squad didn't seem all that sophisticated.

Obviously, they've intentionally set up a lax security system.

It's a ridiculous play.

The Emperor does this to get the Empress to run away from the Empire, and the Devil agrees to it.

It's funny how Bertus and I came to this agreement without ever speaking to each other.

-Waaaahhhhh!

However, the crowd was screaming with excitement at the news that the empire was finally executing the empress.

It was so different from the imperial landscape I'd seen just a few days earlier.

The color of the people's faces remained the same, but everyone was in a frenzy. As if the death of the Empress would change anything.

What would they think if the Empress was kidnapped by me?

Charlotte is, after all, a poor innocent, clueless maiden who is kidnapped twice by the Devil.

Or maybe they'll remember you as an ally of the devil who was so important that the devil had to come save you in the end.

What would Charlotte think of me now?

I don't know.

However, I do what I have to do.

As always.

Bertus would not be defending much, allowing me to take Charlotte, Lucinil, and Sarkegar.

If you're doing a staged kidnapping and the best of the best are leading the execution, you're going to have people who are forced to fight and actually die. That's a comedy of errors.

I'll burst through the death row attendants and guards, give them a good beating, and disappear via mass teleport.

Because you don't need to see blood.

I might kill a few people to show that I'm a demon, to unite humanity in fear of me, but I still don't feel compelled to kill people.

It's not something that requires a large army anyway.

I brought Antrianus and Herriot with me.

Riana, with her hatred of the Empire, is not cut out for this, and neither is Olivia.

-Kill! Kill the Empress!

The three of us watched from a distance as the crowd roared.

A huge crowd had been stirred into madness and was shouting for the death of the Empress.

Looks like.

Three beings hanging from a pole, tied to a pole above a mountain of firewood piled beneath their feet.

To my left was a silver-haired girl, Lucinil.

To his right was Sarkegar, a demonic figure with blackened wings, chained.

And the center.

Charlotte was tied up, her hair graying, her head shaking helplessly.

Sarkeghar did the same, but the thick black mist that flowed from her body made everyone realize that she had become something very sinister.

Look at that.

The Empress is cursed.

It wasn't the princess who returned from the demon castle in the first place, it was the devil disguised as a princess, and he's only now revealed his true colors.

I could hear people crying out.

We don't know if Sarkegar and Rusinil are aware of the situation or not.

Charlotte, however, hung her head in defeat.

It's not about being afraid of people's hatred of themselves.

It was like he was afraid to look people in the eye.

I get those three.

It's easy.

Just make your way through the crowd, split that pole, and use mass teleport to get out of here.

Such.

It's that simple.

Just when you think you're about to enter, looking at the crowd in the distance.

"There's a problem."

Herriot grabbed the hem of my robe.

"Problem......?"

As if the problem wasn't bad enough, Herriot's complexion was white inside his robes.

"The spatial coordinates across this square are all out of whack."

"What? What does that mean?"

Similarly, Antirrhinus, in his robes, smiled coyly at me.

"Great One, it means that throughout this great plaza, a bond has been formed that blocks spatial travel."

"......what?"

What the hell is this.......

What the hell are you talking about?

If there's a spatial teleportation shield all over the place, you don't have the option of breaking through, taking out those three, and then running straight to the mass teleportation scroll.

You have to break through this crowd somehow.

What the hell was Bertus doing defending this?

Did Bertus really want to kill Charlotte?

There's no way that could happen.

Antirrhinus begins to chuckle.

"Hehe....... It's not like we're the only ones who've been thinking about this in our overstretched time....... we weren't the only ones."

Other forces.

"Isn't it possible that there were others who had a premonition that the devil was going to show up here?"

The wrong people got involved in this situation.

"Great One, what would you do?"

Antirrhinus laughs.

By the time he told me this story, Antony had already intuited that this was going to happen.

He didn't tell me on purpose.

"This....... crazy old man......."

As if he had been complimented, Antirrhinus only laughed harder.



* * *



The emperor did not go to the execution chamber.

The view was magnified from a tall spire on the imperial palace wall.

There was no reason for him to perform the execution himself, and he couldn't bring himself to face Reinhardt there.

From afar, watching Reinhardt save Charlotte was the only thing Bertus could do.

The shouts of anger and hatred from the people in the great square reached Bertus's ears.

Oh, how I hate you.

Why do you hate it so much.

Why.

Bertus watched the spectacle with gritted teeth.

Waiting for Reinhardt to show up.

If it doesn't show up, wait for the next plan to run.

"Your Majesty, there seems to be a problem."

"What do you mean ...... problem?"

"We don't know who set it up, but a spatial shift shield has formed around the entire perimeter of the Great Square."

"......what?"

Bertus's complexion turned an earthy color at the words of the imperial mage at his side.

Reinhardt's thoughts and Bertus' weren't all that different.

Bertus knows that Reinhardt has a number of wizards of very high caliber.

So I was thinking that it was just a matter of getting in there and teleporting away.

It was one of those things where Reinhardt would just show up and everything would be fine.

There was no need for a big fight, no conflict, and I was confident that Reinhard would not cause a massacre.

However, the teleportation shield means that even if Reinhardt shows up, he'll have to fight his way through the crowd to the outside of the shield to escape.

If Reinhardt tried to break through that crowd by force, there would be a massacre of epic proportions.

Bertus knows Reinhardt wouldn't want that.

"What kind of asshole would......."

"I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but from this distance I can't tell who installed it and with what intent."

Too far away.

Reinhard would never do that, and Bertus would never tell him to do that.

So this means that other forces have intervened.

"Some bastards....... have realized that the demon is coming here......."

As it turns out, Charlotte and two of the demon's henchmen were actually bait to lure the demon to the execution site.

"Are you trying to kill the demon....... Are you trying to kill Reinhardt......?"

The teleportation shields were meant to kill the demon before it had a chance to escape.

As Bertus realized, if Reinhardt was really here, he was bound to notice the situation.

It wasn't a trap you set, but it ended up being a trap.

We don't know what they are, but we do know that when they show up, the attack will begin.

Reinhardt would be wise to step aside, and rightly so, as his opponent would be fully prepared.

Bertus gritted his teeth.

Only a few people know that this execution today is an attempt by the emperor to lure the devil into taking the princess.

Of course, the executioners don't know the intent.

If Reinhardt steps down, the execution will be carried out as scheduled.

Even if they didn't perish in the flames of the pyre, the executioners would somehow snuff out the life out of the demon's two minions and the princess.

Reinhardt steps forward, and Reinhardt is attacked.

However, when Reinhard retreats, the demon's two minions and Charlotte die.

"What the hell....... What assholes......."

Bertus narrowed his eyes, watching the rage and madness boiling in the great hall.



* * *



-Waaaahhhhh!

-Kill! Kill!

-Kill the dirty demons!

In my madness and rage, I stared at Antirrhinus. Harriet could only bite her lip, her complexion white.

"You knew this was going to happen, right?"

"How can you tamper with the future, Great One?"

"Isn't it true that if you knew this was going to happen, you wouldn't have told me?"

"Of course you do."

They don't even try to hide their maliciousness.

What I thought was a simple problem was actually a stark choice between two terrible options.

Do you run in there, save Charlotte, break through the crowd and escape, knowing that the ambush is coming?

Or watch Charlotte, Lucinil, and Sarkegar die.

Antony loves it when I get thrown into situations like this.

That monster will be happy with any choice I make.

You will be pleased to see me, who made the first choice, dying of foolish attachment.

I'll be happy if my first choice succeeds in rescuing the three of them.

You will enjoy making the second choice, and watching me despair at the reality of having to trade my survival for the lives of those three.

He enjoys pushing me to the edge because he gets a kick out of whatever I do.

Antony didn't tell me anything I hadn't already thought of.

It would be fun if I didn't know that.

-Wow!

To the roar of an angry crowd, the execution is about to take place.

I wonder if I'll die if I go in.

To save Charlotte and me, what would happen to the Edina Archipelago if I, the Archdemon, died?

Without Archdemons, the ruling system of the Edina Archipelago would be untenable.

No, it would be a matter of dying with them like a fool without saving the three of them.

I don't know who's going to attack me.

I haven't even reached mastery yet.

So, no, you shouldn't.

I know.

I shouldn't save them.

My life and the lives of so many others depend on it.

We're putting tens of millions of lives on the scales to save just three.

Even if you can actually save the three of them, you shouldn't risk your own life on something like this.

A monarch is one who commands, not one who wields a sword.

This is reckless.

But.

If you didn't do reckless things because they were reckless, if you lived that way.

I wouldn't have told my seniors.

I wouldn't have dueled with you.

From there, and after many other reckless endeavors, the feat of eventually ascending to the throne would not have been mine.

I wouldn't have had the countless relationships I had, and I wouldn't have had the relationships I had to lose.

I wouldn't have had a relationship I wanted back.

You're right about not doing anything reckless.

I stand on a mountain built by recklessness.

I wonder if the idea that I shouldn't do something because it's reckless is just a picture of me settling for what I've now built with recklessness.

That's cowardice.

That's just defeatism.

I was reckless, and that recklessness alone made me who I am today.

You can't just say "no" to this because it's too reckless.

A monarch is not supposed to do this.

A monarch has too much on his plate to risk his life for something like this.

Throw away what you can.

Take what you can take.

It should be.

But.

I.

Not once.

I never thought I was fit for a monarch.

I didn't do anything because I could.

I did it because I had to.

I've been doing it because I think I should.

I never thought that anything could be done.

I didn't do everything because I thought it was possible.

-Waaaahhhhh!

"I'm going alone."

Looking out at the angry crowd.

I take a step.

"Herriot, neutralize this spatial movement interference."

"Yeah....... I'll try."

"Antrianus, provide ranged support."

"Yes, Great One."

Charlotte De Gradias.

Sarkegar.

Lucinyl.

I save you today.

Again.

Continued next.

Always.

I, I will save you.

That, my lord, is the way I go.
