"Reinhardt? I hear he's a psychic."

"That's not fair!"

"Did you just yell at me?"

"Oh, no. That. That's....... Sorry."

Richard Howleman shouted, then hung his head.

After not winning a single set in the quarterfinals, Richard was furious. He had already realized he was going to lose when his opponent enchanted him.

But they didn't use it.

Some strange force kept pushing me into unintended gaps, and I lost.

Lack of information about your opponent is also a mistake.

So I looked it up, and it turns out Reinhardt was a psychic in the first place.

That's not fair.

Why did I have to lose to such an absurdity, such a nonsense, that I had trained with honest sweat.

Richard Howleman's eyes widened and he gritted his teeth.

If I didn't have superpowers, I would have won. I could have trampled him. But that excuse didn't work.

Richard Howleman was now in the dormitory of one of the regular classes, the Irajon class.

There were classmates and seniors gathered.

Even a temple is a temple, and this was a festive time, so they were sitting around in their dormitories, drinking.

It's not quite up to par with Royal Class in many ways, but it's a temple after all, so it's not overly cramped.

They were the kind of students who, by all appearances, were not the most sincere practitioners of temple life.

The seeming organizer of the gathering poured a full glass of alcohol into the glass of Richard Howleman, who would have been the winner of the night if he had played his cards right, but who ended up being the loser of the night because of the Reinhardt factor.

-zorrrr

"Anyway, you have to keep your word, right?"

"Oh, that....... Hey, promise?"

"I thought you said you'd leave the pageant if you didn't make it to the quarterfinals?"

Why cross-dressing contests are always strangely successful.

This is because it's used as a punishment game between people who know each other. It's like a guillotine match between people who know each other, and there's always enough participants to make fun of the loser.

Those who are laughed at, those who seek to be laughed at.

That's why participants in cross-dressing competitions usually leave feeling like this.

Apparently, not too long ago, Richard Howleman accepted a bet. He was so confident.

Of course, I didn't realize at the time that things would turn out this way.

Overconfidence is a recipe for anger.

Richard Howleman's complexion became contemplative.

"Oh, no, that's not why I did it!"

"I said if you made it to the quarterfinals, I'd leave the pageant, and you did the opposite? Hey, did anyone here not hear that? Raise your hand if you did."

The extreme laughter suppression began.

Even if Richard Howleman's character is a dick, he doesn't have the balls to mess with you, but he's a dick enough to punch you in the face for smiling at him.

"Oh, I'll do whatever you ask me to do, but please don't do that......."

"Leave the pageant, that's all I want from you, asshole."

The senior gulped down his drink and exhaled. As Richard stood there at a loss for words, one of the first years muttered softly.

"Uh, by the way, aren't we done signing up for that?"

"!"

Richard's complexion improves for a moment.

"Don't you think I know that? Hey, you can apply for that an hour before the competition."

As if there was no way out, he giggled and the other seniors seemed amused.

"You would have been in trouble if you won! I was really trying to get out, you know?"

In the first place.

The seniors already knew that there was no way the regular class would be able to make it to the quarterfinals in a tournament where the specialty classes would be playing.

"Reinhardt, you cheating bastard!

Richard Howleman's hatred for Reinhardt was burning, but little did he know that they would meet again.

The day after the festival started.

Tuesday.

It was the day of the grade level tournament finals, and naturally, the first grade games were scheduled to start first.

Yesterday was the main event, but today is the real deal. As such, the audience was much larger today than yesterday, and the theater was literally packed.

In an effort to keep me sane, the kids left me alone today. But they'll all be sitting somewhere in the audience. Not only me, but Scarlett and Ludwig had advanced, so the entire first-year royal class would be sitting in the audience, just like yesterday.

It's all about elitism, whether it's Royal or Orbis. The fact that there isn't a single person from a common class in the final four means that elitism is right after all.

I'm not sure about that.

He will most likely meet Gladen Amorel in the final. Ludwig seemed to have made up his mind about something, but it's only in special cases like mine that determination becomes strength.

If you use enchantment against Scarlett, you're going to have to use enchantment against Gladen Amorelle in the upcoming finals.

For someone like me, who is vulnerable to back-to-back battles, that's the worst. If I pass out, I will be disqualified.

You can't overdo it either. Tournaments are all about earning achievement points, which in turn is about getting stronger.

There's nothing more ridiculous than trying to earn achievement points only to suffer irreparable internal injuries.

I'm not at an advantage by any means. I hold a powerful weapon, a double-edged sword, but if I use it wrong, I'll win more than I lose.

First-year tournament semifinals, first game in that situation.

-Royal Class first-year Reinhardt and Royal Class first-year Scarlett in their semifinal match. It's on now!

-Waaaaaah!

With a shout, I found myself standing across from a girl with fiery red hair and red eyes.

He is armed with a longsword in the same style as me. However, his sword is slightly shorter and lighter than mine. However, the difference in reach is not significant.

I haven't practiced with Scarlett that often, but we've had a few practice matches this semester while taking swordsmanship classes together.

Scarlet is fast and agile, and her swordsmanship is based on excellent reflexes. She tends not to engage in forceful fights, instead using her skill to deflect her opponent's sword or to change the path of her blade with a flick of her wrist to exploit her opponent's weaknesses.

With solid fundamentals, he anticipates his opponent's sword path and attacks with a counter.

Basics.

That is absolutely not good enough for me.

I don't think my skills are bad, but I didn't start from the bottom and build up slowly, because Ellen, who can do everything from the basics to the applications, gave me a good overview.

In a way, I'm a student of how to solve problems; I've been taught conclusions rather than theory, that this is the answer in this situation.

Scarlett, on the other hand, understands the theory perfectly and can understand all the problems that are built on it.

It's a matter of absolute time invested in swordsmanship, which is why I shouldn't be standing here in the first place.

I wouldn't be here if it weren't for Ellen, if it weren't for my superpowers, if it weren't for my enchantments.

But in the end, I'm here, and that means I have to deal with Scarlett, who has an overwhelming advantage in actual skill over me.

Scarlett, one of the two main heroines in the original, had been bullied for being ominous, and much of her confidence was now gone.

In the original story, Ludwig.

For now, Charlotte has taken Scarlett under her wing.

Then, a red-haired girl looks at me.

"Reinhardt."

"......?"

Scarlett opened her mouth before attacking.

The audience can't hear our conversation.

"You're my idol."

"......what?"

I couldn't help but be taken aback by this.

But it didn't make sense to me.

Scarlett and I both came from the same street, after all.

"I was afraid of being kicked out of the temple, and you were always so confident, like it didn't matter."

Scarlett was there for my duel with third-year Mayaton.

I had no contact or relationship with Scarlett.

And it was a duel in an A-class dorm. Scarlett, who was being bullied at the time, watched my duel until the very end, even though Erich had noticed.

After that, I continued to have little contact with Scarlett, but I knew he had something of a favor for me.

Even when I was injured, he would visit me and talk to me briefly about this and that.

It was a different feeling than liking me. We'd pass each other in various places, talking about nothing in particular.

I knew in my gut that Scarlett meant something to me in some way.

I mean, it was called Idol.

"I was looking at you and thinking."

"If I'm weak, it's not because of where I come from, it's just because I'm weak."

"I can do that, I can do that, I can do that and not get kicked out, no, not even kicked out. It doesn't matter if I do."

"Not everyone is going to like you, but not everyone is going to hate you either."

"I realized that if you live a life where you're just standing up for yourself, you can get something out of it, and it's okay to be hated by a lot of people, and it's okay to do things that make you hate everybody, because not everybody hates you, and somebody likes you."

"Just as it's impossible to make everyone like me, it's impossible to make everyone hate me. Looking at you, I realized that."

"I've been trying to change since I saw you, and I can't change completely, but I'm trying to change a little bit, because you can do it, and I thought I could do it, and I should be able to do it."

I thought it was Charlotte who changed Scarlett.

But, no.

Scarlett and I had no contact, but I realized that it was okay to be me.

So things were changing. Scarlett, who was Miss Temple, was now competing in the freshman tournament.

At the end of the day, they're both trying to prove themselves in some way.

Scarlett is trying to prove something.

"I'm sorry, this isn't the place for a conversation, but I had to say it."

I realized that the only reason Scarlett was in the tournament was to be my opponent.

"I consider it an honor to be your opponent here."

I had unwittingly become Scarlett's idol.

Scarlett points her sword at me.





Scarlett's eyes narrowed and her expression hardened, a far cry from her friendly demeanor.

"I'm going to do my best."

After a long, inaudible introduction, the roaring crowd fell silent again as Scarlett took a step forward.

Scarlett's drive to do her best was different. It wasn't the same as what she was used to facing in practice.

This is the main stadium.

Where you can attack with the intent to kill your opponent.

In other words, it's a place where you can just throw everything you've got at your opponent.

"Well, it would be polite to you."

Scarlet.

A crimson-haired girl lunges at me.

As it lunged at me, I could feel its red eyes tracing a trajectory through the air.

-Ka-ching!

"Boom!"

Along with the enormous weight in my grip, I felt an extreme sense of alienation.

Self-implication.

Does not trigger.

"Superpowers don't work for me."

Scarlett is not a superhero.

However, it's also not a superpower.

Because this guy's talents are clearly linked to his superpowers.

Scarlet, the crimson sword.

Talents are immune.

The original name is Spellbreaker.

Magic and superpowers don't work on him.



* * *



Scarlett's nickname, Witch, doesn't make sense in the first place.

Scarlet can basically take all kinds of mental and offensive magic with her bare hands.

This also negates any superpowers.

Scarlett's nickname is Witch because of her extreme resistance to magic.

Of course, he's not completely magic-free, as that would neutralize this stadium's crystalline magic. Adjustable anti-magic. Taking it to the extreme would only make him immune.

Antihorsepower definitely exists and can be trained.

However, there are only two people in this world who are resistant to superpowers.

One is Ellen Artorius, who has a two-way resistance, and the other is Scarlett. And in terms of resistances themselves, Scarlett is overpowered.

Therefore, Scarlett's talents do not grow. Where is the room for growth in her immunity levels and ability resistance?

I did that.

However, it has definitely grown.

I distance myself from Scarlett with a stern look.

Self-implication is the ability to influence yourself, not others.

However, the fact that Self-Implication, a power that strengthens myself rather than attacking Scarlett, doesn't trigger means that Scarlett's ability resistance is affecting her surroundings.

No matter how high your armor is, the only thing you can resist is the magic used on you.

You can't stop a mage from casting a spell on bare ground.

Scarlett can influence the psychic powers going on around her. I don't know if it extends to magic, but I can certainly block my own self-suggestion triggers.

Scarlett's talents are more advanced than the original.

The reason is probably I.

We don't know how, but Scarlet has definitely changed.

He wasn't playing me like a normal practice match, he was using his talent to beat me.

When I said I would do my best, I meant this.

If you haven't used this ability in your practice duels with me so far, was it out of sheer respect for me?

-Kaang! kang! ka-gak!

Your powers have been sealed.

"You can't use it without a magical enhancement, or without the aid of a superpower."

-Kang!

"Ahem!"

Soon, the enchantments that could only be used with the aid of self-suggestion were also blocked.

It's not Gladen Amorelle, it's not Ludwig.

Scarlett was my nemesis.

Scarlett's talents are of no use to anyone in this position.

Scarlett's talent only works for me.

Scarlett might lose to Gladen Amorell, and I might beat Gladen Amorell.

Scarlet can be overwhelmingly dominant for me.

-Kang! kang! kagak!

Ducking back and barely managing to deflect Scarlett's barrage of swords is only possible because her body remembers things that should be called wrong answer notes, if not the basics she's been working on.

She must beat Scarlett through sheer skill.

But is that even possible?

My opponent's time and mine are qualitatively different, but quantitatively, Scarlett wins.

Self-suggestion had become a part of me. Now that it was gone in a combat situation, I felt like I was missing an arm and a leg.

I didn't realize it when I was using it like my own body, but now that it was cut off, I was feeling extremely helpless and empty.

Self-implication was the bulk of my power.

Without superpowers, I've never been so bad.

-Ka-ching!

Scarlet thrust my sword upward, twisting the hilt and slashing at my throat with it.

"Aha!"

-pot!

Reverse recall.

-Royal class Scarlett takes 1 set!

I, lost the first set.
