Ellen Artorius was also watching.

You face the situation with your fists balled into fists, wearing robes that hide your face in case people recognize you.

What she didn't realize was that there was a spatial travel shield around her.

Ellen has only one thing on her mind.

Will Reinhardt really show up?

I had no intention of stealthing if they showed up.

I don't have the right to ask to be taken away. Nor should I.

Ellen knew she was carrying too much and couldn't abandon her people.

Knowing that his disappearance was already a great sin in and of itself, beyond his guilt over Reinhardt, it was already a choice he had no choice but to make.

I just wanted to be able to see it, even from a distance.

Because that's good.

Because that's enough.

Hopefully no one gets hurt in the process.

So, while I was terrified of the madness of the crowd, I stood still and watched the execution.

Charlotte kept her head down, waiting for her death to come.

Charlotte doesn't know anything.

I don't know what's going to happen from here, I don't know anything.

If you find yourself hanging there.

Reinhardt does the same thing.

You can't make that choice when you've become the hope of humanity, but you can delude yourself.

I mean, you can think about it.

Ellen watched Charlotte silently from afar. If Reinhardt comes, Charlotte will be saved, she will be forgiven.

Amid the deafening roar, the executioners slowly prepare for the execution.

In fact, setting fires is more of a show.

None of them deserve to die in the flames of a wood burner.

He would be stabbed with a spear, decapitated with an axe, and so on.

But if Reinhardt shows up, that won't happen.

Those three will be rescued.

The executioners' torches were pointed at the three piles of wood, and flames began to rise with terrifying speed.

-Waaaahhhhhhh!

-Kill! Kill!

-Kill the devil!

-Kill the demons!

Even as she thought her eardrums were tearing, Ellen could see.

Someone making their way through a crowd.

As they walked to the foot of the firing squad, lightly pushing past the crowd guarding it.

-Bang!

Kicking a pile of lit firewood as if to explode it with a single kick.

Just like that.

-Bang!

Kick the other three piles of firewood to pieces with a single stomp.

An unexpected presence.

The being removed its robes, revealing a young man with the appearance of a horned demon.

Even though it was her first time seeing it, Ellen could tell it was a Reinhardt.

"These three, by right, are mine to take back......."

The devil snaps his fingers.

"I'll take him."

-Currrrrr!

Suddenly, a fierce storm of flames erupted around the three poles.

The frozen executioners and surrounding guards jumped back at the sudden flames.

"Line....... Hart......."

-Ma'am, the devil!

-Demon!

-The king is here!

Naturally, the cheers turned to chaos with the arrival of a mysterious demon.

People who had previously hated the devil and the devil's forces begin to flee in terror when the devil actually appears.

And.

-Wednesday!

With a piercing, air-splitting sound, dozens of fireballs begin to rain down from the sky toward the flame barrier.

"What......?"

From the direction of the attack, it looked like it was aimed at the demon, not his minions.

-Koo-koo-koo-koo!

The hail of fireballs began to engulf the executioners and the vast crowd of people on the other side of the wall, as well as inside the wall.

Ellen watched the scene with her mouth open in disbelief.

A demon has appeared.

Then, as if someone had been waiting for that moment, they begin to attack the demon.

Like it doesn't matter how many people are in this place.

The crowds try to flee the sudden destruction.

People were tangling and falling over each other.

People trying to flee are quickly trampled over and crushed.

Then, Ellen looked.

-Kwachang!

-Bang!

Through the windows of the buildings around the Great Square, a number of mysterious black-robed figures, not fleeing, but rushing to the scene.

"What is this....... What the hell is......?"

-Currrrrr!

Ellen watched in disbelief as countless spells of destructive magic were cast beyond the flame barrier that held the demon, and civilians were swept away in its wake.

-Kurung!

In an instant, the barrier of flames dissipated, revealing Reinhardt inside.

Before he knew it, Reinhardt had rescued all three from the firing squad.

In the midst of the chaos, Ellen sees Reinhardt looking around at the fleeing crowd, the enchanted, and the unidentified raiders.

-Order....... It was you guys.

-Yes.

-We couldn't be friends forever.

Ellen doesn't know what you're talking about.

However.

Reinhardt hands the unconscious Charlotte over to Sarkegar.

-Lord and Sarkeghar should get out first, because their target is me, and they'll probably only want to kill me.

-ArkDemon, but.......

-Your Majesty, you can't do that.......

-Go, this is a command.

The demonic figure and the silver-haired girl, who had just been released from captivity, seem to be overwhelmed by the weight of the demon's words. They nod with a stoic expression and begin to move away from the attack.

Like you knew you couldn't avoid a fight.

Lightning rains down from the sky, and fireballs fall.

It's not just magic.

Sword and spear in hand, they charge at the demon, enveloped in blue energy.

We don't know who they are, but they don't look like they're any good.

"Stop."

However, Ellen could clearly see that one of the men who had lunged at Reinhardt's words had flinched, if not stopped, in his tracks.

-Zap!

Alsbringer slashed at the charger's throat. It was a fierce blow that shattered even his enchanted shields and the barriers that had been spread across his body.

A War God's Relic that strengthens the user the stronger the opponent and the more difficult it is to overcome.

Now was the time for the demon to maximize Alsbringer's abilities.

This is not a master class.

However, the massive barrage of offensive magic could not penetrate the barrier of magical energy that flowed like flames for two meters around the Demon King's body.

The horsepower output was overwhelming to behold.

And a lot of power.

-Scissors! Boom!

With his right hand, he sliced through the spearman's shaft, slicing his body from the waist down, and with his left fist, he slammed into the man who had just thrust his sword into him, the shockwave shattering his body.

Masterclasses don't maneuver their power that wildly.

It just spits out a ton of output as it is.

The unrefined destructive force it emanated was not allowing the demon to make a single attack.

Realizing that they can no longer penetrate the Demon with an unlimited charge, they break through the fleeing crowd and set their sights on the Demon.

The demon sees a large number of dead people.

Those who were seriously overcrowded had already been killed by the Black Order's magic by the thousands.

He was dying, not at the hands of the devil, but at the hands of those who would kill him.

"If you can kill me, I don't care what it takes."

The Black Order said nothing in response to the demon's blunt words.

"Yeah, there are a lot of things in the world you can't control."

"Like I can't help it."

"I guess you guys can't help it."

"I understand."

"I understand."

The demon walks slowly.

"So let's kill each other, people who can't help it."

The Demon King's eyes widen, and anger flashes across his face.

-Kurung!

The demon runs.

And the Black Order members stood in his way.



* * *



EpinHauser saved my life against the will of the Black Order.

So I knew enough to know that the Order was no longer on my side, as Antony had warned.

But I didn't think they would try to kill me in this situation, even at the cost of a huge number of civilian casualties.

Black Order.

A group of people who don't know much, but will suffer evil for the sake of justice.

It's poetic, but it also made me realize that these people are a lot like me in the sense that I wonder what's so different about what I do.

The point is not to debate the goodness or badness of each other.

We can't help ourselves.

I have to save my people.

The Black Order seeks to eliminate me, the seed of a great conflict.

Their inevitabilities are colliding, and eventually someone has to die.

I can't die.

So, you have to kill it.

-Bam!

Alsbringer and his opponent's swords swung wildly as they clashed.

-Bam!

"!"

I reached out to grab my throat in a flurry of movement, but a chain appeared out of thin air and wrapped around my left arm.

Whether it was the other's magic or his own, a chain of enchantment grabbed my left arm and wouldn't let go.

He's shaken by my attack, and he stabs me in the nape of the neck.

-Carded!

The sword that hit the magic shield failed to dig into my neck.

"Suck!"

-Quack!

With a strong tug on my left arm, the magic chain was overcome by my strength and shattered into pieces.

Most of them specialize in melee, and most of them are capable of enchantments and even magic.

Melee specialists, wizards, and even mages.

Not surprisingly, the Black Order was also a bunch of crazed monsters.

Now that I was here, it was clear that they were going to kill me.

It wasn't just the ones who wanted to fight in close quarters, but also the ones who were sniping from a distance.

The plaza was still packed with people.

Many people tried to flee, but the crowds were too large to get away.

The number of people killed by the Black Order's magic would overwhelmingly outnumber those killed by their own.

They don't just have enchantments, they have master classes.

We already knew that the Black Order wasn't just a group of wizards because of Dr. Effinghauser's case.

They're watching me from afar, waiting to pounce when it matters most.

They'll send in their minions to create a war of attrition and then stab or slash me to death when I have a clear opening.

Attacking with an auror-impregnated weapon would be the surest attack of all.

Knowing they couldn't break through my magic barrier with destructive spells, they seemed to want to take a different approach.

-Quadruple!

Suddenly, vines sprouting from the earth begin to wrap around my limbs at breakneck speed.

And then, out of those vines, countless bugs crawl and cover my body.

Black Order.

A bunch of sobriety bastards.

It was a spell that was unpleasant to look at.

"Burn."

I don't know what these bugs are, but I'm not going to let them burrow into my body.

-Kurung!

Hwayo's flame glowed, pouring out fierce flames.

The tree trunks and bugs that had wrapped themselves around me turned to black ash and disappeared in a shovelful.

You don't have to kill them all.

All I need to do is escape the Great Square. I don't know what Antirrhinus is up to, but I know that Lucinil, Sarkegar, and Charlotte are safe, and I can leave.

There are eyes on me from all sides, and the Order is not at full strength right now.

I could clearly see him trying to gauge my power.

It's just watching to kill it when it has a clear chance.

The long-range support was solid.

-Quack! Kwazik!

I could see swarms of bats flying everywhere, taking shape here and there, tearing apart the mages who were firing ranged bombardments at me, turning them to blood and killing them.

Antirrhinus, that old man. I wonder if he had access to some sort of alter ego.

Fortunately, the mages attacking from a distance were distracted by Antirrhinus.

People were running away, but they were clearly watching.

So the Empire can't help me, and it shouldn't.

It should exit on its own.

Still, there's something odd about it.

I stare at them as they gauge the distance.

There are a few who are definitely masterminds, and a few who are archmages, but I'm not sure if there are any.

Antirrhinus was not going to be easily outmaneuvered by the wizards.

"But you guys, why is that all you can do?"

But why is this the only black order?

It's definitely a strong force, and there's a lot I can't handle alone.

But if their goal was to kill me, it would inevitably mean that the Black Order's power was concentrated here.

These are certainly not people to be trifled with.

It's a little too shabby for my imagined Black Order supremacy.

"You and the Empire weren't the only ones dealing with the Gate situation on your own."

Someone who's been watching me from afar walks by.

"That's it."

The Black Order made a single appearance in the original movie and was never mentioned again.

That said, they were probably dealing with the Gate debacle and the monster in the background of the story.

Two years after Gate.

The Black Order would have been fighting and battling to deal with the Gate situation themselves.

As it did, it naturally weakened.

As you continue to lose combatants.

It's power, sure, but it's all they've got to eliminate me, the most important seed of conflict.

The Black Order was waiting for me in a place I knew I was bound to come.

He walked toward me, and soon removed his hood to reveal his face.

Sure enough, it was an older man I had never seen before.

Since nothing is what it seems, I couldn't tell how old he really was.

He was a man of many years, but his graying hair made it hard to guess his age.

As he approached me, the other Black Order members who had been confronting me slowly began to back away.

That, to some extent, determined the status of the approaching man.

"Are you the head of the order?"

He stares at me and shakes his head.

"Well....... I don't think 'head' is the right word, since the Order is usually a meeting of the highest ranking members where everything is decided."

I couldn't read anything in his eyes.

"But, with all the highest ranking members of the organization dead except for me....... I suppose it's not entirely inaccurate to say that I'm the head."

He says, still, sword dangling.

"Archdemon, why don't you die here for humanity?"

"You want ...... to die?"

In response, the older man nods.

"I know you love humanity-no, all beings-very, very much."

"And so it is that Epinhauser, who has watched you the longest among us, died for you."

"Because I know you."

"Because I know how much you love me, I had to do it."

"You know that with your death, humanity can accomplish quite a bit."

"Mistrust of each other."

"And simmering despair."

"Even in this situation, where humanity is looking for scapegoats to overcome its despair."

"I'm not saying it will all be overcome, but it will stop this phenomenon of humanity looking for human scapegoats other than demons, driven by an insatiable thirst for revenge."

"But if you die, humanity will have hope."

"Of course, we know there's not much value in hope."

"I realize that nothing can be accomplished with false hope."

"But you can't live without hope."

"You are the epitome of hate and despair."

"Look."

The man points to a crowd of people who, in a panic, are falling on top of each other to their deaths.

"Sadly, your presence is causing despair and fear."

"......."

"No matter what you think of humans, they see nothing but fear and despair in you."

"......."

"When you show up, you panic humans with fear and despair; when you don't, you panic humans with vengeance and hatred."

That very few people understand your intentions.

I couldn't deny it.

I am just a manifestation of hatred, despair, and pain.

I am nothing but a terror to humanity, an enemy that must be destroyed.

Even in the eyes of the beholder.

Even if you can't see it.

I just have a different emotional drive, and I drive people crazy.

"You love humans, but you don't trust them."

"You don't think a misunderstanding so deep that it can't be resolved can be resolved in a beautiful way, otherwise you wouldn't have entered the temple unseen."

"Just as our attempts to deal with the situation on our own terms resulted in this diminished force, you have attempted to deal with this situation on your own terms, and you are here to save those who did not believe in you."

"It's not all wrapped up, but I'm worried about what happens after it's wrapped up."

"There's going to be a war at some point."

"With these wounds unhealed, the humans will insist on slaying the demon at the root of this mess."

"Even if you don't want to, even if the empire doesn't want to, even if the emperor doesn't want to."

"You realize that wars are meant to happen."

"You know people would rather see the death of a demon. than to kill the monsters that roam the continent."

"Today, you tried to save Charlotte de Gradias."

"I think it's a very, very great love and understanding."

"The Devil."

"So, can you please die now?"

"Before more blood is spilled."

"Before more despair and sadness engulfs the world."

"By your death, save the human race."

"Please."

Aside from blocking my path, it was clear that he was admiring my presence.

Regardless of my intentions, I am already a disaster by virtue of my existence.

So, for the sake of humanity, I'm telling you to die on the spot.

I knew there was going to be a war after the Gate debacle.

The Gate Crisis is the original ending.

But after that, there will be war. Wars will be fought because of me.

If I die on the spot, in front of a crowd of humans, there will be no war.

People will rejoice that the devil is dead.

There will be no more scapegoating of the Five High Priests, or any other forces associated with the Devil.

It has nothing to do with my will.

Life generates only despair, fear, and hatred.

Death can save many lives.

So die now, before more sacrifices are made.

He salutes me and tells me to die.

"You, what's your name?"

The older man shook his head at my question.

"I can't tell you. For an ugly being like me would not be worthy to speak the name of a great being like you."

I could tell he had a lot of respect for me beyond his years.

Apart from that, it stands in my way because I have to die.

"It's just that we don't have a black order."

"If good must be done with evil, it is they who do it."

"I'm not going to justify it, because we're not interested in that."

"We do the evil of killing you. We are only trying to do the good of saving humanity."

Is it sophistry.

But I didn't want to point it out too much.

Everyone has a definition they believe in.

That definition is my own sophistry. The man in front of me only stands before me because he lives for it.

"If I die, fewer people will die, that must be true."

Yes, that might be the definition.

That might be the line.

I may have to die.

More can be accomplished in death. There may be more to be accomplished in death.

In the first place, none of this would have happened if I were dead and gone.

As long as the world's malice is directed against me, the more I struggle to do something, the more tragedy and catastrophe will befall me and stand in my way.

However.

"But I want to tell you this."

I tighten my grip on the Alsbringer.

"X."

I.

I want to live.

Alive.

Somehow, I gritted my teeth and survived.

Not a life that you complete by dying.

Instead of dying of discouragement and despair.

"I will live and save."

Must.

Alive.

Not death.

"Whatever it is I'm supposed to be saving."

I'm going to do something with my life.

"Alive."

I don't want to be comfortable in death.

"Alive, with my own eyes, what I have saved. What remains."

I want to live, even if it's on a thorny path of despair.

"Let me see it with my own eyes."

I want to be alive and happy.

Alive.

You can't fix everything that's broken.

Fix the relationships that can be fixed.

I want to be happy.

I know it's foolish and miserable to dream of such a thing, even in this moment, when the world has fallen apart, when so much is broken.

I want to be happy, I definitely think so.

There's nothing wrong with dreaming about it.

No, that could be a mistake.

Maybe it's wrong for a being like me to want that.

Still.

I hope it is.

At my words, the older man looks at me and nods.

"I see."

He pointed his sword at me, and it erupted in a blaze of blue magic.

An unidentifiable black aura swirled in his empty left hand.

"I, for one, will remember you."

As if to remind me for the rest of my life how great I was.

"If I die, will you remember me?"

With those words, the leader of the Black Order points his drawn sword at me.

"That's it, I can do that."

To the first enemy who tries to kill me out of respect, not hatred.

Isn't that the least you can do?

At my words, the older man, whose name I don't recognize, smiles.

"Not the strongest, not the worst, not the worst, but not the worst."

"The best of the best."

"I salute you."

There was no further conversation.
