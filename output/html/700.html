When the man woke up from his dream, it was already daylight.

Just carry it.

I have yet to live the rest of my life, only five years.

Something that doesn't fall apart.

A man whose life's work has been to keep himself from falling down, lives an uneventful life, on a final mission to keep himself from falling down.

Without knowing where to go.

Without even getting anywhere.

You're constantly walking down a path where you don't know if you're running away or moving forward.

An eternal wanderer, wandering in search of that which cannot be found.

The role of the fourth apostle, and the owner of the last holy relic, is that.

Everything is fading, but the fire hasn't gone out yet.

It can burn until it's extinguished.

Holding the most important thing in the world, but also the most dangerous thing in the world.

without letting anyone know I had it.

I walk, and sometimes I stop.

The man stares up at the sky.

In the midst of so much clamor, and with ears that are now barely audible.

Be still as if you were trying to hear the world.

How long has it been since then.

-Mr.

I always see a little girl running up to me, bright, bubbly, and sweet.

I wonder how many days I've been in this nameless town.

I couldn't quite remember.

However.

A town with a cute, adorable, sweet, and spunky girl.

It's time to leave.

"Special for today, I also brought sausages."

The man shakes his head as he watches the girl with the sausage sandwiched between her buns.

"Sandy."

"......?"

Since coming to this village, this is the first time the man has called the girl's name.

The dying man's eyes come back to focus, and he rises to his feet, his whole body rejuvenated.

The guy who was always sitting on the sidelines was always at eye level with the girl.

However, the eye level of the man and the girl who got up is very different.

As she straightens her hunched back, she looks up at him with her mouth hanging open, wondering if he's really that tall.

To Sandy, it was as if the man had become a different person altogether.

The man looks down at the girl and says

"Tell the villagers."

"Deliver......? What?"

What does that mean.

"No matter what, don't leave the house until the sun goes down."

Men are strange things.

Sandy knows he's a weirdo.

But, really.

He's a really weird guy.

Sandy had no idea.

The man starts to walk somewhere still.

To the man's almost distant ears, the sound of horses' hooves was coming from somewhere.



* * *



Sandy didn't know what the man meant when he said that.

But, somehow, it seemed serious.

Sandy was screaming everywhere, just as she had been the day before, that she needed to save the fallen man.

Sandy didn't say, "Don't let the bum come out of the house," out of the blue.

That's just weird, and no one will believe it.

So Sandy got crafty.

A monster has appeared near your village.

Don't leave the house.

I screamed at the top of my lungs.

The good news is that little Sandy, who is known as the tomboy of the neighborhood, has never toyed with monsters.

The story of the monster had people shaking in fear and walking with their doors closed.

Some people asked Sandy what kind of monster had appeared. Sandy said she wasn't sure, but that it was a very ugly, scary-looking monster, and that they needed to be quiet until it passed.

However, Sandy's mother and father thought she was up to something else.

So the moment I vowed to myself that this time I'd really beat the crap out of it.

-doo doo doo doo doo!

In the distance, an unrecognizable roar began to sound.

I don't know if it's a monster or what.

Realizing that something was really wrong, Sandy's parents grabbed her and hid inside the house.

The villagers didn't know what was happening specifically.

However, the noise was getting louder and closer to the village.

Closer, closer, closer.

From the moment you think something has arrived in town.

-hhhhhhhhhhh!

The sound of a horse dying.

-quack!

-What the fuck is that asshole......!

The sound of a person dying.

Everyone's ears were wet with blood.



* * *



When the screaming subsided, Marley was the first to run outside, past the parents, and of course, Sandy.

It was already night.

Frantically running to the place where she had heard the screams and death, Sandy found herself at the mouth of the village, where night had already fallen.

Dead horse.

Dead people.

And the scattered armorers.

Meanwhile, a one-armed man stands, bathed in pale moonlight.

The golden spear in his left arm.

A man who didn't seem to have the strength to break a twig had killed dozens of horsemen.

"Uncle......?"

Even for the most hardy of hearts, Sandy couldn't help but swoon at the sight.

At Sandy's call, the golden spear in the man's left hand vanished like a mirage, as if it had never been there in the first place.

A man slowly approaches Sandy, who is crouched and shaking.

"Ah, ah, ah......."

Then, carefully, he squats down to be eye level with Sandy.

Maintaining eye contact with a terrified Sandy, the man says, "I'm sorry.

"Bandits."

"......."

"I saw a village further west of here plundered by them, and then they killed everyone in it, young and old alike."

"......."

"I wasn't going to bother. The bandits' business....... is none of my business."

You can't care about everything in the world.

But the man stayed in the village.

Even if people notice.

Sometimes you get a pass.

Without saying anything.

I sat in the corner of the barn, waiting for something.

It's not because the man can't see the bandits with his eyes open.

"Sandy."

"There is no such thing as goodness....... originally, no price is given."

"Just because you're good, just because you're good."

"It doesn't make me happy, and it doesn't reward me."

"That's why they're more likely to suffer."

The man puts his hand on Sandy's head.

Just as Sandy sometimes did when she felt sorry for the man.

A hand that looked like it belonged to a dead man.

Was it warm.

Sandy stares at the man blankly.

"But sometimes it was good."

"Good boy."

"There should be a reward for that alone."

"Although it doesn't always pay off."

"When you live like that, you've got to have some good things happen once in a while."

"That way, people will affirm the good, even just a little bit."

"For saving a dirty beggar who was lying on the street, dying."

"The beggar defeated all the bandits who tried to raid the village, like......."

"It can't hurt to have such an unbelievable story."

People you can ignore.

Someone you don't mind letting die.

The girl who screamed all over the neighborhood because she couldn't bear to leave him behind.

And the quirky girl who took care of the beggar to the fullest.

Take care of their meals.

Wash.

Shave his beard.

The girl who could talk.

It was a reward for her goodness.

The man was not interested in bandits.

But the girl had done him a favor, and he had no choice but to repay her with what he could.

He knew the bandits were coming, so he stood guard at the barn, undaunted by the stares from the villagers.

After all, the villagers were good.

I might have given him a look, but I didn't chase him away with a stick.

The heart of this town, the heart that can't help itself.

And Sandy's brutal but kind line.

To repay him, the beggar stayed in the barn for a long time, unnoticed.

"Sandy......."

"I'm sorry."

"Oh no, I've made you see a horrible sight......."

"That's why I told you not to come out......."

But it was inevitable that the girl would witness this.

The man carefully places his hand on Sandy's cheek.

"Thank you."

"You don't have to be this way, you don't have to be this good."

"But your line....... made me feel joy, for the first time in a very long time......."

"I want you to know."

After stroking his cheek a few times, the man slowly gets up.

Sandy still doesn't know what happened.

I don't even know who the man is.

However.

Because Sandy saved someone.

Through someone's death.

The village has been saved.

Turning to the wanderer's back, who is about to leave without a word, the girl says.

"Uncle."

At the girl's call, the man stops.

"Where are you....... are you going?"

At the girl's vague question, the man doesn't turn around.

Clearly, the man was looking for something.

You don't know where that is, so you're just wandering aimlessly.

"Where there is eternal rest."

Just walking away.

To the most important, saddest beings in the world.

To find a land that will give me eternal rest.

The eternal wanderer has left.



* * *



The eternal wanderer walks aimlessly in search of a land of rest.

You don't know where it is, or if it even exists.

In front of the man who left the mouth of the village and started walking randomly.

There were two inyoung under the moonlight.

One was standing, the other was perched on the ledge of a rock.

The man stood still, halting in front of the figure.

"It's been a while, Ludwig."

A face in a blurry field of vision.

Distant voices.

Ludwig remembered the look and the voice.

That hair, red even in the moonlight.

"Scal......let?"

A dear friend was waiting for him in the moonlight.

And behind it.

A being with a pair of horns was staring at him, a being he couldn't help but recognize.

"It's been a while."

Ruler of the continent.

Demon.

"Reinhardt......."

A being with a name that could be heard everywhere sat on a rocky ledge, watching Ludwig.

"......What is it for?"

Naturally, we see a golden spear in Ludwig's left hand.

"......is that Alixion?"

"......."

"Loosen up, you think I'm here to fight?"

The emperor raised his arms as if he had no intention of hostility.

How you found me.

Ludwig wondered about that, but it might not mean anything.

Your opponent is the ruler of the continent.

What you look for, you will find at some point.

If you spread your chain of serendipity wide enough to catch it, you'll eventually find what you're looking for.

Eventually, Ludwig was caught in the chain.

"After all, it was you, wasn't it?"

The Devil says, still.

He was staring at the necklace, which was hidden by Ludwig's clothes, to be precise.

"......."

Ludwig said nothing.

But he didn't need to hear the answer, he already knew everything.

"You saved my life, you may not be alive, but why did you disappear?"

"I didn't save ...... because I thought they were right."

At Ludwig's words, Reinhardt sighed.

"Yeah, well, you saved my life, so if you screw up, come back for it."

You said that since I'm alive because of you, you have the right to take my life.

Reinhardt adds.

"By the way, is that tolerable?"

At Reinhard's words, Ludwig looks at the Emperor with a stony expression.

Tolerable.

I hadn't thought of that.

Every moment is hell, but you just don't get knocked down.

"I think I should take that one."

"......."

"There's no reason you should have it."

"......."

"No matter how much I think about it, it's mine to keep."

Someone has to keep carrying the soul stone that would be a disaster if left alone.

Ludwig continues to fight this in real time.

It's the world's heaviest burden.

Ludwig bears the sins of others.

So the emperor's point about me carrying the burden rather than you makes sense.

"I can't let you have one of these, after you've cost me my life for nothing."

We didn't save the emperor because he was right.

But you can't make the emperor carry the burden.

As if he knew Ludwig would say something like that.

"So you're just going to spend the rest of your life looking like a bounce back and then die?"

"It's none of your business."

"Why don't you at least put this life behind you? It's not hard to make yourself comfortable, and if you're not going to give that up, I want you to realize how important you are."

You don't have to be a wanderer.

In fact, it wasn't that long ago that I almost fell down on the street and died.

At the Emperor's suggestion to make life easier, Ludwig shakes his head.

"I need to find it."

"......."

"These are not monsters....... They're just sad beings who had no choice but to become monsters."

"......."

"So, I have an obligation to find a way to give them rest, and it's up to me to do it."

It's not a burden to be eradicated or someone else's to bear.

It's just a bunch of miserable statues that can't find rest.

We need to find a way to give them a rest.

That's why Ludwig is looking for a place he doesn't even know is there.

Scarlett looks at Ludwig with a sad, obsessive look on her face.

The Emperor is still, staring at Ludwig.

"You're still stubborn as ever."

The Emperor had guessed that Ludwig would refuse all of his offers.

"Then let me make a suggestion."

"I don't intend to receive anything."

"Are you going to look up 'the end of the world'?"

"......what?"

The end of the world.

Ludwig's eyes widened at the out-of-the-blue comment.

I wasn't going to take anything for nothing, but this was an unexpected offer.

"I'm trying to figure out where the hell this world starts and where it ends."

"This continent we're on may or may not be the only one."

"So that's why I've been preparing the fleet for a long, long time, just to find out."

"We'll be sailing soon."

"Maybe not."

"I might have just the thing you're looking for."

"Divinity and magic. And superpowers."

"Maybe there's another force beyond that, and maybe it can do the impossible."

The Land of Rest.

Is there such a thing.

Could there be another world beyond the continent?

Now ruler of the continent, the Demon King wants to find out if there are other worlds beyond his own.

Margins of the story.

For there may be something in the margins of the ocean beyond this continent, just as there always has been.

Try to find it.

Ludwig stares at the demon in silence.

Not waiting for an answer, the demon pulls something out of his arms.

It was a magic scroll.

"To go, use this."

The idea of a teleportation scroll that takes you to a designated location was one that even Ludwig couldn't quite grasp.

The demon stares at Ludwig.

"We're not happy to see each other, so I'm leaving."

Again, they're not the kind of people you'd want to have a long conversation with.

"And if you can't handle it, you can leave it with me. I'm not asking for it forever, but I can keep it for a few months, and then if you fall apart, I'll lose it. You know?"

"......I'll give you something to think about."

I had a purpose.

Ludwig received three offers and turned down two.

"Finally......."

The Devil looks at Ludwig with sad eyes.

"I'm sorry. Everything."

Ludwig doesn't know why the devil is apologizing.

Shouldn't we be saying thank you?

Why do you say sorry.

But the demon said nothing more.

Scarlett looks at Ludwig with a sad expression and bows her head.

-Flash!

With a flash of teleportation, they were gone, as if they had never been here.

Ludwig stares at the scroll in his hand, dumbfounded.

End of the world.

The devil is not complacent and wants to do something.

Beyond that, there may be nothing, or there may be something.

However, beyond the known world.

There's probably another possibility there.

What you can't find on this continent, you might find in the world beyond.

It's better than just wandering around.

Ludwig didn't think long about it.

-Flash!

The scroll unfolded, and light enveloped Ludwig's body.

Then, when the light fades and you open your eyes.

Ludwig was on a hill, overlooking a huge harbor.

The ships were encamped.

It's a fleet of ships headed for the edge of the world, where we don't know how far.

So it had to be on a scale that had never been done before.

In the midst of all the big ships, Ludwig saw mermaids coming and going in the sea.

And, behold.

Friendly faces.

A face you never thought you'd see again.

"...... You're here, Ludwig."

Disappeared Shaman.

"Detto......Morian?"

Detomorian was there.

A shaman who didn't always know what he knew and where he knew it.

Heading in an unknown direction, not knowing where he was going, not knowing what he was looking for, not knowing what powers awaited him. Naturally, a being who wielded powers beyond the world's understanding would have to pave the way.

"To the other side of the world."

The Dettomorian will go with Ludwig, beyond the borders of the unknown.

"Let's go together."

Ludwig is overwhelmed by the expanse of the Great Sea and the abyss beyond.

I was looking out at a huge fleet of ships that would sail in the direction of dawn and dusk.
