After the funeral.

The Duchess seemed to be chatting with her relatives, and we decided to bring Riana to the outbuilding for a warm bath in case she caught a cold.

We didn't say anything. We didn't know what to say.

The story of why the devil did what he did is not something we can discuss here.

Knowing the truth, I was feeling a heavy weight.

The revolutionary forces are not lost.

It falls into Owen's clutches, and he freaks out.

The unthinkable was about to happen: the revolutionaries would be used.

The forces that want to overthrow the regime fall under its sway. This is what it's all about.

The situation sucks, but I have to agree that Bertus is way over his head.

If you messed with the revolutionaries at the wrong time, you could end up with an entire empire of revolutionaries running amok at the expense of taking out their leaders.

Bertus' plan was to disguise the attack as a demon raid and kill the leader of the revolutionary forces.

And in case the revolutionary faction falls into chaos, he's groomed Owen to be the next leader of the revolutionary faction.

Owen will make it look like we used force because something really went wrong at the negotiating table with the demons. He'll silence the internal uproar.

And in the long run, they'll weaken the revolutionary forces little by little and let them die out, or they'll create infighting and let them implode, or they'll do whatever they want.

In other words, I was completely taken advantage of.

I couldn't think of a better way to take down a revolutionary without making too much noise.

I wasn't the only one who could use the name of a demonic force. Empires holding demonic prisoners could also do things under the guise of demons.

Bertus was inspired by my killing of Leviathan.

"Be careful."

"Yes......."

Riana descended into the outbuilding's parlor, dressed lightly.

Riana sat on the couch, hugging her knees, staring blankly ahead.

We didn't say anything for a while.

No one, and I mean no one, spoke up.

Deep in the night. The silent hours have passed and everyone has gone to bed. Silence reigns in the room where the party was just a few minutes ago.

The thought of caring for Riana kept most of her friends from leaving the Duke of Granz's estate.



* * *



A cold winter rainy night.

-Parse! Parse!

Cliffman was awakened by an alien sound coming from somewhere.

No, I wasn't actually asleep. I was just in a state of wandering, somewhere between sleep and consciousness.

Klippmann got out of bed and headed for the hallway.

I knew who this sound belonged to.

In the parlor, on the first floor of the unlit outbuilding.

-Pagic!

Riana sits in a daze, repeatedly casting a lightning bolt into the air.

"......what are you doing?"

At Cliffman's words, Riana snapped her head up and looked toward the stairs where Cliffman was.

"......just."

A sullen-looking Riana lowered her eyes and said.

Like the confident, energetic, and always mischievous Liana de Granz had disappeared.

Riana was there, looking depressed and frustrated.

Cliffman cautiously descended the stairs.

Then, I sat down across from Riana.

Riana looks at Cliff and smiles faintly.

"Now, you must be tired."

Kliffman was shocked by Riana's smile and words.

This is no laughing matter.

Riana laughs, even though she's not in a position to say such kind words.

Cliffman is unfamiliar with this version of Riana.

But what Cliff doesn't realize is that in this situation, people become kinder.

I had an unconditional ally on my side.

I didn't treat him like he mattered.

Thinking it would last forever, she treats him badly. Only after he's gone does she become loyal to him.

In retrospect.

Because he realized the obvious: no one can be forever to him, and he can't be forever to anyone else.

Treat people with respect.

"Thank you, everyone, for today."

Thus, Riana becomes gentle.

Regretting all the days I wasn't nice.

"......."

"Don't worry about it, he'll wake up in a bit."

Clifford stares at Riana, who seems to be a different person, even in her demeanor.

A boy named Klippmann is inarticulate to begin with.

I'm not good with people either. I thought I was getting better as I was being thrown around by this mean girl, but I'm always going backwards. I still feel awkward around people, especially girls.

No improvement.

Cliffman doesn't even know what it means to treat people casually, business as usual.

But right now, Riana is not her usual self. In this situation, Kliffman is even more unsure of what to say.

But it's weird.

Originally, it was hard for me to even look at Riana's face.

If someone stared at them, they would break out in a cold sweat and look away. Riana, in particular, had a tendency to stare, and Clifford found it unbearable; he would ask her why she kept looking away, and he would challenge her to look him in the eye.

I don't know why it's so hard, but when Riana looks at her, it's like someone is squeezing her heart, and it's painful.

But now.

Kliffman looks at Riana, but she's not looking at him.

It's not awkward to stare.

In this situation, it's hard to know what to say.

I don't know how to treat them normally, let alone comfort them.

However.

Just because you don't know, doesn't mean you can't do it.

Even if you don't know, you can at least try.

You can do something to normalize them, and you can do something to comfort them.

You just don't know if the attempt succeeded or failed.

Kliffman now.

"Riana."

"......?"

"Drink....... Do you want a drink?"

I wanted to comfort Liana de Granz.

Riana looked at Cliffman, her eyes widening slightly in surprise, as if she hadn't seen that coming.

"......."

In this situation, tassels.

For a moment, it feels like she shouldn't, but Riana stares at Cliff.

The boy's eyes, uncomfortably wide, stare back at him. He tries to look away, to do something, anything, for now.

I look into the eyes of a boy who looks like he's made the biggest leap of courage he's ever made in his life.

"Yeah, good."

Riana smiled thinly.



* * *



In the middle of the night, a boy and a girl share a drink.

Strong whiskey, no snacks.

A girl who lost her father drinks alcohol.

The boy who wants to comfort the girl also drinks. It was one of those nights where you know you're going to get drunk, but you'd rather not. Because some days, you just want to anesthetize yourself and move on.

There wasn't much conversation.

With each sip of whiskey, Riana looked out the window of the outbuilding.

I could see the main house through the windows, dripping with winter rain.

Klippmann didn't ask what she was thinking. He just stood across from her and took small sips of his drink in time with Riana's tempo.

"My dad ran away to marry a commoner he met at the temple."

"...... is it?"

Klippmann listened to the story calmly. He didn't stutter or panic as usual.

Riana bit her lip slightly, as if to nibble at the edges of a noncommittal laugh, and then continued her story.

"Yeah. It failed and I got caught, but if it had worked, I wouldn't have been born."

"...... I see."

"Neither my mom nor my dad ever told me what she was like, just that she was a blot on my dad's life and a blot on my mom's life, so I don't know if she's dead or living a normal life."

Riana takes a long sip of her whiskey.

"After he was captured, the family forced him to marry, because they were in a hurry, and there were rumors. He couldn't find a good wife, so he married my mother. A paltry noble with no lands and no titles. The second daughter of the Earl of Relion."

As any socialite knows, Cliff is not a nobleman, so he has no idea what Riana is talking about when she talks about family pride.

But Kliffman was listening in silence.

"Mom would have wanted to like Dad, but Dad couldn't like Mom, and then, of course, Mom couldn't like Dad. It's doomed from the start."

"I was just a vehicle to force that creaky marriage to stay together. I don't even know how I was born, but I was born. I guess you could say I was a sacrificial lamb. Every time they had a big fight, they'd talk about me. They'd look at Riana. They'd look at me. Or me. My mom says it, my dad says it, and when it's time to make a drastic decision, it's always about me, so I'm like, "Why do you want to do this when Riana's here?"

"I was sick of it."

"Do you think we're like the only accomplishments in each other's lives?"

Riana sips her whiskey.

"Anyway, I hated my mom and I hated my dad. I hated my mom because she tried to run my life, and I hated my dad because he seemed to be letting me off the hook, but he was so blatant about wanting me to live the life he couldn't. After all, if he'd been nice to my mom from the beginning, she wouldn't have been such an evil person."

"Mom is the outright problem, but Dad is the one who pretends not to be a problem, but is actually the biggest problem."

"So I hated my mom and I hated my dad, and I really, really hated them."

Riana pours whiskey into a glass and rolls it around in the glass.

"Well, I think I liked him more than I thought I would."

I thought you didn't like it.

Because of the regret that washes over you the moment you can't see it anymore.

The rush of regret and guilt that comes with saying something you didn't realize was the last thing you'd ever say.

"I'm an asshole, just like you said."

Riana's eyes were wide and she was crying.

"Everything is....... I regret it so much......."

Clifford watched as Riana set her glass down, unable to drink, just staring into it and crying.

"Why the hell. Why the devil. My dad....... Why did he take my dad to....... Why did it have to be that way. Why did my dad have to die. He may not have been a good husband, but he was a good father to me. He may not have loved my mom, but he did love me. He may not have loved me as much as I loved him, but he loved me as much as I loved him. I used that as an excuse to rationalize our unhappy marriage. So....... 吸. 읍....... After....... And. he was a good man, my dad. He was good to people, he didn't do bad things, he was a good....... person, but......."

Cliffman stared at the sobbing Riana.

Duke Granz was a good man on the outside.

I didn't think he was a good husband, and I didn't think he was a good father, but I didn't think he was a bad father.

Riana says so in a world where her father is gone.

You can't get back what you lost.

If so, you can only hope for the best.

You can't understand why you had to lose, so you start thinking about why you had to lose.

"Me, so....... So....... I'm a psychic. I wonder if I can get revenge. I wonder if I can fight. I wonder what my power would be. I wonder if I could be that......."

Plural.

Sleepless nights.

Riana vaguely envisioned revenge, frying lightning bolts.

Because you're a superhero.

You can't pick up what you spit out, and you can't turn back time.

Maybe he can dream of revenge on the demon who took his father from him.

Riana sat alone in a daze, checking her powers. She's a psychic, and psychic powers are very rare.

The Devil is such a big name.

Even the name Duke Granz pales in comparison to the name Demon King.

So it was trampled underfoot.

On a rainy winter's night, Riana wondered if she could stand up to the mighty name of the Demon King.

He's a powerful psychic who can manipulate electricity, but there's no telling how strong he'll be.

And so, out of despair, regret, and revenge, Riana is driven.

He saw himself battling the devil, and he was afraid.

Cliffman looked at Riana as she did so.

"Let me help you."

I said, holding still.

"......?"

"Let me help you. I will."

At that, Riana's teary eyes narrowed and she stared at Cliffman.

The smaller two.

Standing in front of a giant name doesn't make much of a difference when you're working together.

"If we do it together, it'll be less difficult."

Not that it will be easier, but that it will be less difficult.

The words felt strangely real.

It's oddly realistic.

It's a statement that rings so true, so true to Kliffman's heart.

I'm not just saying that.

It was a sincere way of saying, if you're going to risk your life on the difficult task of killing a demon, I'm going to risk mine to make it a little less difficult.

"Why would you......?"

I can risk my life, but why should you?

At that question, Cliffman took a long gulp from his full bottle of whiskey and blew out a hot breath.

"We're friends."

Those were the first words out of Klippmann's mouth.

At that, Riana stared at Cliffman, unsure of how to respond.

Riana stared at Cliff, slightly frozen, before finally giving him a thin smile.

"I'm sure you have something stronger to say than that."

"......."

"But if you're this big....... You've grown a lot."

A stronger word than friend. The words made Klippmann's face widen.

"Thanks."

Just as Cliffman drained his whiskey glass in one swift motion, Riana drained the rest of her glass in one swift motion.

And then.

-jurrrrrr

He spilled all the expensive whiskey left in the bottle on the floor.

The corners of Riana's eyes cracked open, but there were no more tears.

"As for alcohol, I can't drink for a while."

Until you kill the demon.

Riana said with a wry smile.



* * *



The funeral was over, and we all returned to the temple.

Riana has also returned to the Temple.

Riana was not energized.

However.

-Haah.......

-Take a break when you're tired.

-No. Add.

-No, rest, you'll only hurt yourself.

-But a little more.......

-I know this one better. Rest.

-Uh......? Ah. Yeah....... Yeah. I'll take a break, then.

Riana started doing early morning training.

Ellen and I watched from a distance as Riana and Kliffman ran together.

Stamina is not a disadvantage. And to be fair, Riana's physical strength is pretty low. Not as much as Charlotte, but not as much as a properly trained close combat student.

Riana wasn't particularly enthusiastic.

I had a superpower, a superpower that grew on its own, and that was enough.

My family was wealthy, so I didn't have to worry about life after graduation.

They're only interested in playing around with everything, and weren't they disappointed that we were living too hard not too long ago?

Gone is the Liana de Granz.

-Haah....... ha.......

-Beware of ice.

-Yes.

With a venomous glint in her eye, Riana gritted her teeth and followed Cliffman, who could barely keep up with her.

She was the one who dragged Cliffman, who was terrible at interpersonal relationships, around and tried to fix his personality somehow.

Now, Cliffman didn't seem to be stuttering or embarrassed by his treatment of Riana.

Instead, it was now Cliff who was teaching Riana something.

A common goal erased Cliff's shame, and Riana's unfaithfulness.

Their respective pain points were gone.

In the form of someone's death.

For the purpose of revenge.

Ellen and I look at Riana, sweating in the middle of winter, gritting her teeth and chasing after Cliffman.

"The devil is a long way off, I thought."

Ellen looks at me.

Champion of Tuan.

And the master of two holy objects.

That's just for us, Ellen seemed to think.

The Devil is a symbol of fear for most people, but it's not something I'll ever have to deal with or have it affect my life.

But Duke Granz has been killed by the Devil.

Someone around you has suffered grief and pain directly caused by the demon's actions, and has been changed by them.

"Reinhardt."

"Uh."

"Me, I'm angry."

Ellen's eyes were wavering.

I'm forced to admit that the Devil is really, really evil now, and this is hard for me to accept.

Ellen seemed to be furious, hating the demon for destroying her friend's life.

It's not quite the same as their anger.

"Me too."

I'm the one who's most upset.

"Let's go."

"Yes."

We run together.

Furies, even if the true object of their vengeance is different.

We build our day together.

Until the end of a day of running together and the beginning of something to look forward to.
