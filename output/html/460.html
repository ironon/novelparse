That night.



King Edina's bedroom.

I was sitting on my bed, watching Harriet dry her hair.

Herriot had now changed out of the clothes he had been wearing just moments ago and into his pajamas.

"Get some sleep. You've got a lot to do tomorrow, and you're going to the Empire."

"......You should."

If nothing else, Harriet and I have been sharing a bedroom for about six months now.

There are two beds in the king's bedroom. One is occupied by me, and the one next to my bed, slightly further away, is occupied by Harriet.

We share a bedroom for one reason.

Assassination threats.

The actions of those who hate me become visible and manifest.

It doesn't happen too often, but when it does, it's persistent and tries different things.

It was a poisoning, a midnight raid.

People in the castle were often collaborators.

They're not even bought.

In some cases, people who would normally hate me were merely cooperating in an assassination plan.

There was also the time when Harriet and Olivia were forced to save him from dying after he ate a poisonous snake.

Herriot, who normally researches new magic and magical items, has taken on the role of scribe and is never far from my side.

After that, Harriet started doing poison checks on everything I ate and drank, and I even bought the talent Poison Resistance with achievement points.

I was able to cope with a physical attack because of the warnings of my sixth sense, but only those who have been through it know the eeriness of seeing the face of a familiar human being holding a dagger to my windpipe while I slept.

A lot of people hate me.

Even the humans of the Edina Archipelago, whom I saved, hate me because they know that the Devil is at the root of all this.

It happened even after we replaced all the heavy users with people who had nothing to lose from the Gate debacle.

All humans hate me to a greater or lesser degree, and I couldn't have the entire workforce of the kingdom composed entirely of demons who would obey my every word. The issue of discrimination and the subordination of humanity was only going to cause more backlash.

I wasn't the only one suffering from the raid, either.

I won't die, so I'm going to kill everyone around me.

If only.

I once fell asleep and woke up to find Antirrhinus standing outside the palace, tied up and chuckling at me.

What do you think it would be like if it wasn't you, but a wizard from the Empire or the Black Order.

It was a bad move on Antony's part, but the memory of it still sends a chill down my spine.

I'm safe because the Empire and the Black Order don't know where I am yet. I realized that a wizard of Antony's caliber could take my life at any time if he wanted to kill me.

It's not completely unprotected, but it can be breached at any time.

So, ever since then, I've been sharing a bedroom with Harriet, and it's become a habit of mine to go to sleep with a number of magical devices and covenants in my bedroom as a seal.

At first, both Harriet and I felt weirded out by each other, but time is a medicine and we've gotten used to these things.

I couldn't help but notice that the Devil was rumored to share a bedroom with a scribe every day.

Olivia was surprisingly not upset about it.

He was actually worried about me because he knew I was under that much threat of death.

Anyway.

It was starting to become known that I was practically married to Herriot, but I couldn't help it.

In the end.......

I have to say that now I'm kind of like, is there really anything different about that?

In fact, in some ways, Herriot is more situationally competent than the Archmage of the Senate.

In most crises, I'm the physical one and she's the magical one, so naturally, Herriot and I spend the most time together protecting each other because of our complementary nature.

After drying her hair, Harriet sat down on her bed and placed the scrollbook on her bedside table.

"I put in the teleportation scrolls. I have over twenty of them, so you can always use them if you're in a hurry."

"Okay."

"Do you want me to come with you?"

Her hair untied, Harriet stares at me.

"No, I don't think it's a good idea to go. I'll go alone. It won't be dangerous."

You'll be disguised as Sarkhegar's ring, so you won't be recognized.

It's not like I don't know what's going on, and I don't think it's a pretty sight for anyone in the Empire to see. I'm going to go quietly, alone, and come back quietly.

I lay down on the bed, and Harriet sat back on the bed with the spellbook she had been looking at, spreading the book between her knees and opening it to the middle page.

A faint yellow glow of magic illuminated the book Harriet was looking at.

"I'm always growing up and you're not?"

"Sleep as long as you want."

As if to say never mind and grow up, Harriet waved at me without looking at me.

I was busy, but I knew it was going to be tiring for Harriet, who had to coordinate what I needed to do and make sure her bedroom was safe.

Honestly, I'm feeling it too.

Somewhere along the way, Herriot's magical achievements stalled.

Whenever he has time, he's doing the research he wants to do, but his time is so limited that he doesn't get much done.

Herriot is actually the perfect person to be a researcher.

But there's no one else, and there's no one else I can trust, and you're too good for that, so you're my secretary and bodyguard.

I have a lot of work to do, and I can't do any of the things I really want to do.

So this short time before I fall asleep, when all I have to do is stay with it.

During that time, Herriot sneaks in some reading.

I think Herriot would have loved Akasha.

However, Akasha is gone.

As such, the magical achievements of Akasha's long history have been transformed into a shadowy otherworld.

How much magic was in Akasha.

Now it's just not there.

The sound of a book being turned over in silence.

I listen to the page turn very carefully, not wanting to disturb my sleep.

I look at Harriet's face as she looks at her book.

"Pfft."

"Yes."

He doesn't even look at me when I call him Paxton anymore.

I don't call it that because I'm actually a scribe.

When it's just the two of us, or as we used to call it back in the day, I can only say one thing.

I wonder if that's why Herriot isn't mad at me.

Because you know that only in this moment can I call you that.

"Thanks."

At my abruptness, Harriet looks at me with a gentle smile.

"Me too."

What are you thankful for.

I feel like I'm always taking and never giving.

I couldn't figure it out.

Harriet turned back to her book, and I closed my eyes.

-Pow!

Through the warp point, dozens of people appeared in the middle of the square in a flash.

Warp gates were currently unavailable, so troop movements over very long distances now had to be done manually by wizards with access to mass teleportation.

Given the circumstances of the Edina Archipelago, it's no wonder that the only people who can move via mass teleportation are a small, elite group.

And now, appearing through the warpspot, was Ellen and her immediate troops.

Ellen was scheduled to report for duty in the ecliptic and then head straight to the next point.

-O.......

-You are a warrior.......

Ellen Artoraus had become a celebrity for lack of a better word.

The state of the empire was such that, in terms of crowd confidence, Ellen was more popular than the Emperor.

So, it's no surprise that a cloud of people gathered around Ellen.

"Warrior, our savior!"

"Where are you headed this time, warrior?"

"Warrior....... Thank you for saving the day!"

Ellen has saved many lives. More than I can count.

"Warrior, you look great!"

"Warrior!"

"Champion, watch over us......."

"Why doesn't your sister come to the zodiac so often?"

It had become so familiar that Ellen was no longer surprised by the sight.

However, Ellen was afraid that people in despair and pain would project their hopes onto her.

You're the cause of all this.

People believe in themselves.

She blames the devil for everything and loves herself.

I didn't have to run around trying to save people.

If I had believed Reinhardt back then, none of this would have happened.

You didn't save people.

Everyone is in this pit of despair, and it's their own fault that they can't even wear the right clothes, that they're like rags.

"I love you, warrior!"

It scared Ellen that so many people were finding hope in her.

It's all my fault.

It's my fault.

Don't like me, don't love me, hate me.

It's me who should be hated, not the devil.

Ellen was occasionally overcome with the urge to say something like that.

But I couldn't intentionally bring despair to those who found hope in me.

To those who somehow endure this miserable life by hating the devil and believing in the hero.

I couldn't intentionally feed those victims the hopeless drug of truth.

People find salvation in Ellen.

That's why people who get excited about the ecliptic don't turn into mobs.

If Ellen says it's all her fault, people won't believe her at first, but even if they do, it's a problem.

The moment the crowd realizes that the warrior and the empire have made a mistake, the empire falls.

When empires fall, there is no humanity.

"Will your sister kill the demon for me?"

"ah......."

A little girl clings to Ellen's arm and asks.

Demon.

The eyes of those who believe that killing the devil will bring peace to the world.

From a child's longing for hope to an old man's hateful glare.

The hope of humanity.

As its spokesperson, I can't help but feel that one day I'll be forced to stand before Reinhardt.

It was, and Ellen was afraid.



* * *



Central Palace Tetra.

"Cairnstadt's capital, Köln, is fine, it's which of the satellite cities we restore first that matters."

"Yes."

Ellen had just finished debriefing Bertus and they were discussing what to do next. Ellen stared at Bertus, who looked tired.

Even the most powerful empires had only succeeded in defending a few cities, including the capital. The Empire had restored all of its direct territories, and now had to decide which of them to fully support.

From now on, the restoration of Cernstadt, the capital of the First Reich, would begin.

All warp gates in Cernstadt territory had been destroyed.

So all you need to do is eliminate the monsters lurking around the city.

But that's easier said than done, and a lot of soldiers, knights, and wizards were going to die doing it.

We're rebuilding an empire at the expense of human resources.

"What do you think?"

"I think we should start by clearing the perimeter of the cities that have been successfully defended, rather than trying to restore them one by one. We've already....... There will be few survivors in the fallen cities, so I think we can work on that later."

"......Yes, that makes sense."

Bertus crossed his arms, contemplating.

"Charlotte is....... What do you think?"

Bertus clicked his tongue at Ellen's question.

"......."

Ellen is a hero of the Empire.

So, just as I'm tired of being told to kill the devil, I'm also tired of hearing the misconceptions about the Empress.

The Empress is cursed.

Beware of the maiden in case the warrior takes damage.

Ellen is often away from the ecliptic, and when she returns, she tends to check on Charlotte's condition. After all, Ellen is the Empress's guardian knight.

But Ellen couldn't open Charlotte's closed mouth the way Bertus could.

Though she couldn't speak, Charlotte burst into tears when she saw Ellen.

Just as Ellen was beating herself up, Charlotte was beating herself up.

The moment we looked at each other, we realized that all of this had happened because we didn't trust Reinhardt.

Just like Ellen blamed herself for everything. Charlotte was also blaming herself for everything.

Even if they couldn't talk, Ellen couldn't help but feel for Charlotte as she watched her fever rise.

The bottom line was that the majority of the crowd now wanted the Empress dead.

"Other than that, is there anything else you need on site?"

"As always, it needs a power cartridge."

"Of course....... I don't know when we'll have a mass production system in place."

Power Cartridge and Moonshine.

As Reinhardt had intended, the power cartridges were now the most vital commodity on the battlefield in the event of a gate breach.

Mages, who drew their magic from power cartridges, were a formidable force on the battlefield.

The close combat students who had taken Moonshine were improving at a rapid rate. In fact, the number of those awakening to the power of magic was growing exponentially.

So there was a bizarre phenomenon going on where the dying military forces were being more or less made up for by the growing strength of the existing military forces.

It was probably created to make the Demon King's army stronger.

What Bertus had thought of as a prized possession had now become an indispensable commodity.

Only after everything happened did Bertus realize that the choice he should never have made was the only right answer.

We should have let the devil go free.

Even though he knew that regret was useless, Bertus was plagued by it.

In all of these situations, everyone blames themselves.

Charlotte said to herself.

Ellen says to herself.

Bertus also.

That you are responsible for everything.

That's what I was thinking.

"Did anything in particular happen that you want to talk about?"

"......."

Ellen was silent, and then something occurred to her.

"I heard there's a paradise down south."

"Paradise?"

"Yeah, I think some weird....... beliefs are spreading."

"......Yes, that's what you want to believe."

In times of overwhelming desperation, strange things can be made up.

So Bertus had no choice but to dismiss the rumors as false.
