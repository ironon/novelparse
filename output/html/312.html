            Episode 312.





Group C is over.

As such, neither Olivia, who advanced to tomorrow's tournament semifinals, nor Herriot, who was eliminated, had any business at the tournament site.

"You, you're such a bad girl, you're such a bad girl, you know you're a bad girl, right?"

"Only for my sister."

"That, that's......! That, but you're bad too!"

Olivia blushed bright red and followed Harriet inexorably. Olivia didn't win, she was defeated.

So I felt like I lost even though I won. No, I lost more because I won.

Harriet says, glancing at Olivia, who is giggling beside her as she follows.

"Shut up, the game is over, don't bother me, go on your way."

"......You! I'll get my revenge! You'll see!"

Olivia said something that sounded like a loser's excuse for a winning topic, then stormed out of the tournament.

Harriet smiled at the back of Olivia's head.

Still a bit.

I thought I was being self-controlled.

It looks like he's pissed off to the max, but when he's on the field, he's killing it, and now that he's out of the game, he's not touching a hair on his head.

If you're that upset, you might lose your cool and try to hurt yourself.

He ran away because he didn't think he could stand the minutes.

I'm sure he's a man of his word, but the way he's acting makes me think he's not at all.

'He's a weirdo.......'

For better or worse, Harriet still wasn't sure about Olivia Ranze.

Of course, you don't know if they're good or bad, but you know they're unpleasant.

We exited the main stadium. There was a crowd of first-year Royal Class students.

Reinhardt exclaimed.

"Bam, you did it, man!"

I lost.

Everyone was looking like they had won.

"I was believing?"

"......You didn't believe me the first time."

"Gah, hmm. Hmm. Hmmm!"

Reinhardt's excited shout made Ellen and the rest of the class stare at him.

Herriot knew Reinhardt was fidgeting with anxiety.

Everybody rallied around Herriot and said it was amazing. They said it was amazing.

Even if I didn't use my divine powers, even if Olivia was looking down on me, winning a set was huge.

The students weren't the only ones to welcome Herriot, of course.

"Baby!"

"Uh, uh, mom......."

Mrs. St. Thuan hugged Herriot fiercely. She knew her parents were in the audience, and she knew they would come for her, so she wasn't too upset.

But calling her a baby in front of everyone made her blush.

"That was great, sweetie. Are you hurt anywhere?"

"Oh, don't call me baby......."

Parents were there, and the students were sneaking off to watch.

Knowing that you're being treated like this at home makes the situation even more unbearable.

The Grand Duke of St. Thuan watched with a pleased expression on his face. He could see that his daughter, who had come a long way, was overwhelmed with pride.

Mrs. Saint-Antoine, who had spent a long time telling him he was fine and that he'd done a great job, held him in her arms and stared at him.

"But....... Mr. Reinhardt?"

"......Oh, yeah, it's been a while!"

Everyone was surprised that Mrs. Saint-HaÃ«tien knew Reinhardt.

Long time no see?

Where and why would Reinhardt have any business seeing Harriet's mother in person?

And Reinhardt was frozen, his complexion white as a sheet.

"If I'm not mistaken,....... I think it's my baby who you're calling paktong......."

Reinhardt's white complexion turned almost green with the words.

Madame St. Thuan looks at Reinhardt with a kind and gentle smile.

"Is that right?"

"That, that....... That, that. That. That said......."

"Yes, that's right."

The answer came from neither Herriot nor Reinhardt, but from Ellen.

Reinhard froze and looked at Ellen.

Are you going to kill me?

Ellen's stare only served to distract her.

Ellen looked as if she'd had enough.

Mrs. St. Thuan's smile deepened. But it was an eerie smile, as if a thousand blades were lurking within it.

"Mr. Reinhardt, can we talk for a minute?"

"That, that. That's, that's, that's the story......."

-chuck

Then the Grand Duke of St. Thuan, who had been watching the proceedings with amusement, stepped forward and placed his hand on Reinhardt's shoulder.

"This is the kind of story that makes me want to call my daughter Paxton."

Archduke Saint-Thuan's face hardened into a grim line.

"Oh, that must be a great story, yeah."

It must be a great story, the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan was saying with his eyes.

"Kill me."

Reinhardt eventually paid up.



* * *



I wasn't beaten back.

But when Mrs. Saint-Antoine patted me on the shoulder, saying she had no idea our daughter had such a cute nickname, I realized that a knife to the throat would be less creepy than that.

Herriot was stunned.

It would be weird to defend me or not defend me.

Yes.

I can't help but think that I'm now retroactively paying the price for teasing the daughter of an archduke and the princess of a country as a paktong.

The Grand Duke of St. Thuan did not say that if he ever called my daughter that again, he would kill her.

They just look at me with a cold stare.

It was even scarier when he didn't say anything.

"Lift."

"Oh, that. Yeah."

But.......

What am I doing here?

A restaurant inside a temple.

I was sitting with the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan and his family. The Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan exchanged a few words with Charlotte and Saviolin Tana, whom he was obviously familiar with, and then came over to dine with his daughter.

And.

Before I knew it, I was there.

I'm not trying to follow you.

I didn't ask you to follow me.

It's just that Mrs. St. Thuan naturally dragged me along. She didn't ask me to go out to eat, she just asked me to talk to her slowly on the way, and we ended up at the restaurant.

What is this?

What's going on?

Herriot was equally puzzled.

Why is she sitting here? No, why did mom bring him here?

He had that look on his face.

Feeling possessed by something, the menu came out and me and Harriet idly teased our forks and knives.

Don't say anything, don't ask any questions.

I feel like if I say the wrong thing, there's no turning back.

What it is.

Alone in Arnaria, meeting Harriet's parents, and now sitting here with them.

Even though Harriet and I are engaged to be married, isn't this a reversal of the order?

"Sweetie, when are you going to be able to do that again?"

"Yeah, I was wondering how that works."

Fortunately, neither Madame Saint-Antoine nor the Grand Duke seemed to have any spare time for my side of the story, and indeed neither did I.

The second set against Olivia. Her performance there was way beyond what I expected.

"Uhhh....... So I didn't give it a name, but I guess you could call it scroll magic applied to the human body."

Herriot rolled up his right sleeve. I didn't see any tattoos.

But as she concentrated, blue lines of energy began to form on her arms, taking the shape of letters.

Archduke Saint-Thuan looked at the complex string and nodded in understanding.

"It's a Rune."

"Yes."

"You mean you've translated modern magic into runes?"

"Yes."

Only the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan could truly know how difficult that would be, and so he stared blankly at his daughter's nonchalant yes.

Even though she was his daughter, he was clearly surprised that she had done such a ridiculous thing.

Herriot smiled subtly.

"I didn't do it alone, I had a lot of help from the Magical Research Society, and the idea came from another kid."

"If you're a magical researcher......."

Harriet looks in my direction.

"Yeah, the one he said we should make."

The words drew the gazes of Madame St. Thuan and the Grand Duke to me.

Your daughter has been raving about how she's going to do wonders for the world in her magical research.

It wasn't the way he wanted it to be, but Heriot had already done something outrageous. In collaboration with members of the Society for the Study of Magic.

In the end, I was right.

Archduke St. Thuan and Herriot discussed their new magic for a while.

Most of the time, I couldn't understand it at all. But I knew what it felt like because Louis told me.

You've turned your body into a living, breathing magic circle.

I couldn't figure out how to actually use magic and what making your body function as a circle of magic had to do with being able to reduce your casting speed so drastically.

"My daughter, this will be the only system of magic in the world that you will ever use. For an ordinary wizard, the act of translating modern magic into runes, memorizing all of it, and recalling it when needed would take much longer than the traditional casting method. While this method eliminates the manipulation of magic from the casting process, it does make the computational process longer."

"......Yes, I guess so."

In the end, it's just a case of hitting the nail on the head. It would be a disservice to the average wizard to use this method.

Increase the formula and skip the step of actually running the horsepower.

For Heriot, it's a way to use magic on the fly, but for other mages, it's a waste of time.

Anyway, I called him a genius, but he's a real genius and he's done something that's only possible because he's a genius.......

For what it's worth.

Hmmm.

I'm pretty sure I could lose to Ellen.

If I'm confident I can fight him, why shouldn't I?

"Why do you have the same face as your dad and mom? Gee, it's offensive......."

I'm pretty sure I and Archduke Saint-Antoine were making similar faces the whole time, and Herriot's expression turned sour.

Madame St. Thuan, the Archduke, and I.

Apparently, the three of them are feeling pretty much the same way right now.



* * *



"How's it going, you're not choking or anything?"

"It's okay."

"......I have to hold my breath to wear something like this, and you don't even have that, and honestly, it's not fair, is it?"

Riana tried the dress on Ellen and stuck her tongue out at how easy it was to get pregnant and how nonchalant Ellen was in the tight garment.

The Miss Temple contest is right around the corner. It is the main event of the festival, along with the finals of the unlimited weight tournament.

So Ellen and Riana were doing one last check, and Riana was busy running back and forth between Ellen's room and Cliff's room.

So the busiest person at the festival was Riana.

Reinhardt's tournament is over, and so is Herriot's Unlimited.

Now, only Ellen and Cliff are left of the first year Royal Class to do anything. Looking at Ellen in the mirror, Riana touched her cheek.

"Straighten up. Is something wrong?"

"No, not really."

Ellen sees her expression in the mirror.

I don't think I look like I'm in a bad mood, even though I don't feel like I'm doing anything out of the ordinary. Ellen tried to force a smile, but it didn't work.

Smiling naturally is hard for you, so when you force yourself to smile, you end up with a weird expression. I wouldn't say it's ugly, but it's definitely not a smiling face.

But right now, I was having a harder time smiling than usual.

I couldn't stop thinking about Reinhardt today.

'ha.......'

'Ehh.......'

"Ma, aren't you worried?

'What if we lose ....... What if we lose, huh? No, losing is losing, but what if we lose badly?

"Don't you look like you're shaking!

'Okay! I'm not dropping! I'm not dropping!

"You shivered again? When?

The one who couldn't sit still for a second and sighed heavily with anxiety.

'Wow. That. What. No. What is that? That.'

"What the hell, what's going on?

'Come on, look, he did it!

"I was counting on it!

Reinhardt jumped for joy when he realized that Herriot was strong enough that he didn't have to worry.

I could tell he was genuinely concerned about her and was rooting for her.

Ellen was surprised, too, because even though she abstained, she still managed to give Olivia a run for her money.

If I were in that position, I wonder if I could have done as much as Herriot.

Probably not, Ellen thought.

Well, if I were in that position.

I wonder if Reinhard would worry about me like he does today.

I wonder if he would have cheered me on like he did today.

Maybe, I thought, I'd be worried, but not to the extent that I was fidgeting like I was today.

Reinhard doesn't like Herriot. Normally, he'd be worried about a subject like this.

You're good at what you do, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.

If you lose, I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out on your own.

She is more concerned and interested in Reinhardt than she is in Harriet. Seeing Reinhardt like this, Ellen had to admit that uncomfortable feelings were already building inside her.

Jealousy.

You're jealous of Herriot.

So, I couldn't get the biggest question of the day out of my head, the one that felt like a stone in my heart.

"Long time no see!

Reinhard seems to be acquainted with Herriot's parents. So does Archduke St. Thuan, and so does Madame St. Thuan.

Apparently, Herriot already knew that, because he didn't seem surprised at all.

How?

No, not how, but why?

Why was Reinhardt meeting with Harriet's parents?

Did you ever get together with Herriot, and why, and Reinhardt, and why.

You haven't told yourself that it's happened before, have you?

No, there's no reason for Reinhardt to tell himself that.

But.

Still.

I realize there's a lot I don't know about Reinhardt.

I don't want to know about this.

I don't want to find out this way.

Of course, you're not the only one with questions.

"By the way, it's a bit odd that the Archduke and Archduchess know Reinhardt."

Riana said it in passing as she smoothed Ellen's clothes and matched her accessories.

Everyone was surprised to see Reinhardt being grabbed and dragged by the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan in front of the stadium.

"You never know."

"Is that so?"

Ellen said she was the one who was most curious about why.

At some point, you start lying. Pretending not to be curious about something, pretending to be okay with something when you're not.

Ellen hated the way she was changing, little by little. Lying, hiding her feelings.

"But is Reinhardt close enough to the Archduke to even dine with him?"

"......."

Ellen gritted her teeth at Riana's words.

If he didn't, his face would be distorted in the mirror.

It's hard to smile.

Ellen managed to keep a straight face.

"I think that's it. I'll just go check on Cliff. He probably doesn't even know how to get dressed."

"Yes."

Only after Riana had left her room did Ellen relax her grip on her molars.

Ellen looks in the mirror.

She saw herself in a colorful dress, her shoulders bare, her necklace, earrings, bracelets, and other flashy accessories.

Not bad.

I think so myself, but Riana kept telling me that it would be weird for you to be this good and not be Miss Temple, and so on.

Let go of useless thoughts, jealousy, inferiority complexes, and doubts.

Because you're not doing yourself any favors.

Ellen didn't wonder about anything else.

If you see yourself dressed like this, you can imagine what Reinhardt would say and how he would look.

I'm just curious about that.

I'm a little surprised myself, but I'm sure Reinhardt would be, and I believe he would be.

I'm both terrified and a little excited to see what Reinhardt has to say after that.

Inside her room, away from Riana, Ellen looked in the mirror and tried to force a smile.

It still didn't work out, but it's possible to try.

I figured that alone might make me laugh at some point.

Ellen practiced smiling at herself in the mirror.



* * *



"......."

Olivia Ranze was lying on her bed in her room.

Olivia may have won Group C of the main draw today, but we all know she was pretty dirty.

Olivia Ranze, A-0, 5th grade.

With a few exceptions, Olivia is still kind and gentle to everyone. She hasn't changed much.

But I knew Olivia would be a little sensitive today, so I didn't have any of her classmates come over to say congratulations to her, even though they're her younger siblings.

So, now Olivia was alone.

Lying on her back, Olivia stares blankly up at the ceiling of her dorm room.

Assuming he was using holy power, he could somehow survive the final magical attack.

No, we wouldn't have gotten there in the first place.

Divine magic isn't just about healing and protection.

In addition to that.

Olivia raises her hand and sees black smoke rising from it.

Corrupted Holy Power.

Olivia can use that too.

If there was a tiata there.

I wouldn't have been humiliated by a kid like that.

You lost because you won.

I'll never forget the look on her face as she declared her abstention.

He knew exactly what his victory would look like, complete with a disqualification.

You may have won, but you've lost.

You dropped a set that you should have won, and you won.

So, it's a lost cause.

Even if you win the tournament, it doesn't change the fact that you lost to Herriot.

There's no point in thinking about it. "What if?" and "What if?" are meaningless.

I lost to Herriot de Saint-Ouen.

That's all that remains.

You feel demoralized, but you can't shake it off.

After all, it wasn't about beating them up or beating them.

I need money.

Money.

If you win the tournament and are crowned Miss Temple, you will receive a cash prize.

That's the goal, so let's just focus on that. The tournament semifinal and final opponents won't be so easy.

And Miss Temple needs to get ready.

Olivia sobbed out of bed and opened her closet.

I sold everything but what I needed, so my wardrobe consisted of nothing but school uniforms and normal everyday clothes.

'I wish I had at least the dress I wore to the benefit.......'

I sold my things to help others. I sold all the dresses and jewelry that my foster parents had bought me and that I wore to various events.

There's no reason to do that.

I can't think of another reason not to.

I don't think my true needs are met by things.

Olivia did just that.

"Haha......."

So, Olivia stared at her closet, which was devoid of anything other than her school uniform.



* * *



The Grand Duke and Duchess of St. Thuan dined that day and didn't return until evening. The Grand Duke is a busy man in many ways, and it's clear that he's been forced to take time off due to Herriot's tournament appearance today.

"Well."

After seeing off the Grand Duke and Duchess, Harriet said.

"What did you say ......, I didn't say anything?"

"It's time to say something, now, what are you going to say, say it early!"

You've been holding your tongue in front of the Grand Duke and Duchess, and now it's time to spit it out. Herriot's face is bright red.

"Uh, uh, uh, uh....... My mom is going to make fun of me for just calling her that...ah......."

His lips were pursed as he spoke, like, "You're such an asshole." Does he think I'm going to argue with him?

"What's the point of teasing, you're a kid."

"You're making fun of me again!"

I haven't had a good reaction in a long time.

You're going to make fun of me even if you don't want to, and you're not going to be able to stop yourself!

"Hey, come on. I'm sure you could have done it without me."

"I don't do it, I don't do it, I don't do it at home!"

Herriot's face flushed bright red and he snarled, "No, you certainly wouldn't, I know that, but you're far too susceptible to demagoguery and fabrication.

But I'm already a kid, stomping my feet in frustration.

It's funny how you get stronger, but your mind stays the same.

"What did I say?"

"I don't do that! Why would I do that at my age!"

......what.

Why is it so cute when a seventeen-year-old says, "At this age?

It's a real flirtation!



If I pushed him any further, he'd probably do something magical, so I restrained myself, but sometimes you have to play it safe.

On the way back to the Royal Class dorm.

The crowds were still there. It would only get more crowded by Friday.

Today's Group C final of the Unlimited tournament must have been quite the talk of the town. It was a fight like no other, even for me.

A first grader who spins magic at near-instant speed.

A fifth grader taking it all in and charging like a tank.

It was crazy because it took me away from everything else.

"But....... Is that weird?"

Herriot walked still, then muttered to himself.

"What's weird?"

"My mom calling me that. It's weird....... don't you think?"

What is.

Was she still thinking about it? She seemed genuinely ashamed of it. Well, maybe it's a problem for him.

Neither the Grand Duke nor the Grand Duchess of Saint-Thuan will continue to treat Harriet like a child.

But maybe that's just the way it is.

Looking at the embarrassed Harriet, I smirked.

"Why is it strange for parents to love their children?"

"......."

The Grand Duke, who acts stern and stern, but oozes love for his daughter.

The Grand Duchess continues to hug Harriet, not wanting to let her out of her arms.

I don't think Harriet liked the look of it, but I did.

Why I had to watch that spectacle from start to finish is a mystery.

"Of course, it's mostly assholes who come out of that environment, right?"

"You, what are you trying to say!"

"You're not exactly a dick, are you?"

It's clear that he was raised in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it's not a sin for a parent to love their child, and Herriot may have been in the original, but he's not now.

"If you think about it, the words are good, but why are you always like that, asshole? I, I've never heard such, such, such words in my life!"

Needless to say, he was not amused.

I think it's kind of funny that you're saying this because your parents are good people and you've had a good upbringing.

I wonder if I have some kind of disease that prevents me from being able to say nice things straight out of my mouth.

But when he gets all red and pouty, you can't stop watching him?

With that, we head back to our royal class dorm.

It's winter.

It was nighttime.

So, it was cold.

"It's cold."

"It's winter, silly, of course it's cold."

"Do I have to be called an idiot for saying "cold"?"

"I don't know about anyone else, but that's not something you should be saying, especially to me, after all the times you've teased me about this nonsense!"

Herriot starts up again. No, but this time you started it first.

The weather felt particularly cold today. It's the middle of winter, it's nighttime, and we're dressed very lightly. Herriot and I were both breathing white.

How much colder is it going to get?

Of course, we're not at the poles, and the weather isn't going to be that harsh.

Come to think of it, magic is God, right?

Just because it's cold doesn't mean it has to be cold.

I nudged Herriot, who was walking still beside me.

"Hey, it's cold."

"......what."

"It's cold."

"Whatever."

"Do something."

"Why would I?"

Harriet glares at me, demanding I come up with something.

Even on the desert island, Herriot summoned a heating sphere and put it in the kids' tent.

It's a spirit, it's Nabal, it's magic. Herriot pouted at my demand that she come up with something, then closed her eyes softly.

I thought you were going to summon the fever spheres from the desert island.





"......."

Herriot suddenly grabbed my hand.

He couldn't even look at me, his head hung low.

No.

This.

When I first awoke from my enchantment and asked to be put to bed because I was so sick, Herriot didn't perform a sleep spell, but instead sang me a lullaby.

When I realized it was a misunderstanding, I wondered if it was really dead.

Am I asking for magic and I'm getting it all wrong again?

"No, dude....... It's not this, it's magic......."

"I know."

The words made my head spin.

"I....... I'm not that stupid......."

His voice trembled so hard it sounded like it might break at any moment.

I took his hand, even though I knew he was asking for magic.

Her head down, she takes my hand and leads the way.

I wasn't gripping it too hard. I can't squeeze harder, and I can't let go. I let Harriet take my hand and lead the way.

"Hey, how was your day?"

Herriot asked.

"It was the best."

I said, sincerely, without pretense.

"......."

"......."

We didn't have any further conversation.

No words, just walking.

The dorm was quite a distance away, requiring a tram ride back.

However, Herriot walked right past the tram stop and kept walking.

As if I wanted to walk like this forever.

It's like you're hoping the place you need to go back to doesn't show up.
