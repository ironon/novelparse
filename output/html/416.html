Darklands.

"This must be an unusual place."

Archduke Saint-Thuan muttered to himself as he walked across the misty ground.

-Physics!

-Can!

Before the Archduke could do anything, one of the beasts was struck by a blast from the mages around him, disintegrating into ash.

Archduke Saint-Ã‰tienne had now entered the Labyrinth Zone with his mages.

It doesn't start the moment you enter the Labyrinth, it starts the moment you enter the area surrounded by thick fog.

The Archduke and the Mages were navigating cautiously, taking one step at a time.

"The mana concentration in the atmosphere is erratic."

"Yeah, I'm feeling that too."

Though he couldn't see through the fog, the Archduke's senses could feel the mana around him fluctuating.

Mana in the atmosphere is supposed to have a constant, if not uniform, concentration. That mana is always changing, which means that there is always something going on around you.

"The environment around us is changing in real time with our movements. Even the demons that attack us are probably not real creatures, but variables created by this labyrinth."

The Archduke is not a clumsy wizard.

So, unlike other adventurers who mindlessly beat their way through the monsters of the Labyrinth, I had a different approach to the Labyrinth.

Don't move around.

This maze isn't something you can move through.

As the Archduke knew, the labyrinth was rumored across the continent.

The labyrinth was already well known in the Darklands as a favorite haunt.

That's why the mothballs were getting tangled up.

Some adventurers wander off for days on end, returning as superheroes, while others never return.

Those who return with a few spellbooks from the labyrinth that sucks in so many adventurers like an ant-hole are worth a fortune.

Nevertheless, the center was never breached, so the archduke came with his own elite.

"Compared to the number of adventurers in this labyrinth, don't you think the number of people you encounter along the way is too small?"

"Yes, Your Majesty."

Before entering the Labyrinth, the Archduke gathered information from those who had actually experienced the Labyrinth at a nearby staging point.

The labyrinth has sucked in a staggering number of adventurers, but most have emerged unharmed.

The labyrinth itself wasn't designed to kill, but to make people wander around and die of exhaustion, and the demons that spawned were more of an artifact that the Archduke didn't even have to go out of his way to see.

So, exhausted, they turned back, rearmed themselves, and entered the labyrinth over and over again. With the hope that one day, they would reach the heart of the labyrinth.

The fact that you could keep failing and keep trying again was what kept adventurers hooked on this labyrinth.

In the unlikely event that they find a grimoire of immense value, their lives are relatively unimportant, and the adventurers are bound to get into trouble.

So the Archduke knows that there are tons of adventurers wandering around this vast region.

So if they could actually see the people in this labyrinth, they would have to face another party of adventurers.

But in all his hours of wandering, the Archduke had only encountered a party of adventurers once so far, and they'd gotten scared shitless at the sight of his group and disappeared into the distance.

"It looks like there's a nesting of dimensions. Maybe there's not just one labyrinth, but dozens or hundreds of layers of labyrinths, and that's why I can't see other people."

The Archduke surmised that the phenomenon must be a labyrinth of overlapping spaces, where everyone enters by a different path.

"It's not the depth of this labyrinth that matters, it's just figuring out what this labyrinth is that will change the world."

This labyrinth was already a body in itself.

It's a labyrinth with hundreds of layers of dimensions in a single space, and its surroundings change in real time. The Archduke sensed the mana around him, made some educated guesses about the nature of this labyrinth, and came to a conclusion.

"This labyrinth changes the path so that we cannot reach its depths in the first place, unless the master of the labyrinth leads us inward."

It's a maze that changes in real time, so you can't get to the exit any one way. As you wander, you lose your sense of direction and end up walking this way or that, just as the maze master intended.

The servants await the Archduke's judgment.

The Saint-Thuan family has a long history.

A family that has gone from tanning leather to being the losers of a region through the use of magic.

The Saintoons are also known for never forgetting their roots.

Power and glory have been theirs, but they have not forgotten their roots as wizards, and they have honed their craft from generation to generation, passing on their mastery to their successors.

Nevertheless, there is a degree of righteousness.

Never intoxicated by the lust for power.

He has always shunned unclean and evil powers, keeping in mind that the extremes of the martial arts are never achieved through the power of the saihan.

The House of Saint-Thuan is renowned not only for its magical prowess, but also for its purity, for never going near an apostle.

The apostle's path is a fast and unorthodox one, but in the end, it is only the apostle's path that leads to mastery.

The Archduke focuses on the flow of mana around him.

The labyrinth is structured in such a way that the moment you enter, you are lost. The moment you take a step, you're entering one of the dozens or hundreds of virtual dimensions that this labyrinth has to offer.

You can't find the way out of this labyrinth no matter how much you wander inside, so there's only one way to get out.

You need to get out of the virtual dimension of the labyrinth of hundreds of layers and head back to the original dimension that actually exists.

"......."

The Archduke finds his way.

A sense of nested dimensions, and a single path through them.

The only way out of this labyrinth is to carve a path back to the original dimension.

It's not about finding the gate to the labyrinth, and it's not about digging through the labyrinth.

This labyrinth was not only complicated in terms of the path itself, but also the math to find the only living gate.

Finding the true path through the dimensions that were changing and being created in real time was like trying to find the eye of the storm in the middle of a typhoon in the middle of a typhoon.

However.

Geniuses who go down in martial arts history are not born for nothing.

Herriot de Saint-Ouen is the daughter of the Grand Duke.

"Here."

As such, it's no wonder that the Grand Duke's Five Stars are no match for a mere wizard.

-curl!

The Archduke waved his hand, and the void gaped, opening a portal.

"All hands on deck."

The Archduke walked toward the exit, his servants trailing behind him.

Stepping through the gate, the Archduke looked around. He felt no pride or satisfaction in having broken through the labyrinth that so many adventurers and mages had wandered through.

The look on his face was unimpressed, as he was just doing what he was supposed to do.

"Not much different."

We broke through the maze, but the surroundings were still foggy and not much different from where we'd been walking.

"The flow of mana is stable."

"Yeah, I guess this is where we need to be, even if it doesn't look any different."

The flow of mana, which had been rampaging and altering the environment, has stabilized. The Labyrinth is essentially a vast portal in the surrounding mountains. The moment you enter, you enter a virtual dimension.

Therefore, the interior of the actual labyrinth was bound to be a tranquil area with no labyrinths in any of the devices. It's just foggy.

Now that you're not lost, all you have to do is find Richie's tomb, which is somewhere around here. If Richie's tomb is sealed, this will take some time, but the Archduke has already found the way.

"Remember. We're not there to take a spell."

The Archduke walks slowly and speaks to his men.

"Unholy beings would not study pure magic. We will destroy most of their grimoires. Those who are blinded by vain desires, turn back, and we will show you the way."

"Your Majesty, but there may be considerable magical value in the grimoire we found."

"I'm sure it will."

The Archduke already knew the value of the discovered grimoires.

"It is possible to build good with evil power. I'm sure."

The Archduke does not know the value of power, and he knows that it depends more on the will of the wielder than on its own nature.

"But in a world where most people don't build good with good power, what does evil power have to say?"

It is too much to expect evil powers to do good in the world when even paladins and priests do evil as they breathe.

Something that evil powers shy away from even its appearance.

It is the minimum good that the Grand Duke considers, and it is also a teaching that has been passed down through the Saint-Thuan family for generations.

The Archduke believed that magic was already too powerful, and that more magic might actually harm the world.

The Archduke is there to destroy Mado's new vision and Richie's new discoveries, not to take them.

How many steps you took.

"There's someone there."

"I see."

The Archduke saw the faint shape of someone beyond the fog.

Master of the Labyrinth.

Or a visitor to the same labyrinth as you.

The Archduke is confident in his abilities, but he's also not cocky.

You've broken through the labyrinth, so it's possible that someone else has broken through the labyrinth, so it's possible that someone else has broken through the labyrinth and is walking ahead of you.

"Don't be afraid. I have no intention of hostility."

Before leaping into action, the Archduke made his intentions known. If he uses his hand, he'll have to face him, but there's no need for bloodshed.

It was clear that whoever I was up against was not normal, as I was in the equivalent of the exit of a labyrinth from which I could never reach the exit.

The figure turns at the sound of a voice from behind.

-.......

It was a woman, her head turned in silence, looking at the Archduke.

A cold-looking woman with long black hair, dressed in a simple outfit and wearing a single cloak.





It was unarmed and pale-skinned.

"I didn't know there were customers."

The woman spoke in a monotone, cold tone. Her calm gaze held neither hostility nor favor. Of course, she was skilled enough to break through the labyrinth, so he couldn't treat her lightly, but he couldn't figure out who she was.

"Are you here to find the dungeon?"

"That would be the case, so to speak."

The woman replied, bowing her head slightly as if in greeting.

"Ordinarily, I would pass you by, but circumstances being circumstances and place being place, I must ask: I am Raphael de Saint-Ã‰tienne of the Duchy of Saint-Ã‰tienne, and may I ask who you are and where you are from?"

The woman shook her head slightly and stared at the Archduke.

There was no fear of the many mages behind him, no fear or curiosity about the Archduke's presence.

"Luna."

The woman with the moon's name says still.

"I'm Luna of Rizaira."

The archduke did not know the name of the town.

"That's the name of a place I don't recognize, sorry."

"It's a small town in the middle of nowhere, no wonder you don't know it."

The damsel in distress was the first to break through the labyrinth that the Archduke, the most magically savvy of the Archmages, had broken through.

Neither the Archduke nor any of his men believed her story of being a peasant. But the woman stared at him, unwilling to explain further.

A calm stare that conveys neither hostility nor favor.

The Archduke was reluctant to send her ahead of him, or to let her go ahead of him, even though he couldn't tell if she was an enemy or an ally.

She was a young woman, but the Archduke had no idea of her true age. There are many who have mastered the maneuvering of magic who don't look their age, such as Xaviorin Tana, the head of Shanapelle.

The opponent didn't seem to be anything close to a dungeon or labyrinth master.

However, if this person has arrived to secure the scroll, a fight is inevitable.

The Archduke opened his mouth nervously.

"Since we don't know what our mutual understanding is, I'll say up front that I intend to destroy the dungeon and burn the spellbooks. What about you?"

"There's no business in the grimoire, so if that's what the Archduke is doing, I don't see how our interests can conflict."

If you're in a place made famous by a grimoire, and you're not interested in grimoires, then why are you here?" He couldn't quite trust this strange woman, but he didn't seem willing to share his surface animosity.

"We're going the same way, so why don't you come with me?"

"If it pleases His Highness, of course."

The expressionless woman gave a faint smile at the Archduke's offer.

For some reason, the Archduke had the uncanny feeling that this woman would not be his enemy. But it's not in his nature to rely on such intuition.

Paying attention, I was about to move forward when the woman who introduced herself as Lunara flanked me.

"Oops, I didn't realize there were already customers."

From the woods to the side, a young man emerged through the fog.

One more woman.

The Archduke narrowed his eyes at the sight of more who had made it through the labyrinth.

Rather than panic at the sight of the newcomer, the woman simply stared at him, her demeanor no different than when she'd met the Archduke.

The man smiled and scratched the back of his head, as if something was missing a screw.

"I'm going to be blunt, because this is the situation, and I'm going to say, "You're all very passionate about this, and it's not going to do anybody any good to fight right now, so why don't we just sort it out and then we can talk about it further?"

The man who appeared out of nowhere cut to the chase.

She's not interested in the grimoire, but he makes no secret of the dungeon's purpose.

By the time you break through the maze, there's no doubt about each other's skills.

We're not going to do anyone any good by fighting now, so let's just clear the way and then go for each other's throats.

A woman whose intentions are unknown.

A man whose intentions are too obvious.

The Archduke thought for a moment, then nodded.

"I will."

The Archduke agrees, saying that it would be a disservice to each other to divide up the numbers even before the true nature of the dungeon is revealed.

"Raphael de Saint-Antoine."

At the Archduke's introduction, the man smiled.

"as Dwin."

This was also a new name to the Archduke.
