It's weird to be a fanatic.

It seems helpless before God, but there is such a thing as free will.

Radia Schmidt tried to kill me. She didn't actually say that, but it was so obvious that I didn't even need to hear it from her mouth.

Radia Schmidt, who had followed me with such intentions, realized that it was actually the champion of Tuan she was trying to kill.

Radia Schmidt, who believed her faithfulness was second to none, was forced to admit that she did not recognize the champion of Tuan and tried to kill him.

Fanatics are not skeptical (懷疑) about God.

Usually, they don't even question themselves.

They seem to believe in God, but in the end, they believe in themselves.

You believe in the fact that you can't be wrong because you have faith in God.

But the facts didn't support his beliefs.

The man he was about to kill was actually the one chosen by the gods.

The moment Radia Schmidt admitted it, she had to admit she was wrong.

And fanatics can't do that. If they could, they wouldn't be fanatics in the first place.

Because.

Radia Schmidt can't admit that what she was about to do was the greatest sin against God.

Without denying or doubting God, she must create for herself the logic that she must not be wrong.

"That's supposed to be Olivia's! That's....... That's not supposed to be in your hands!"

Naturally, Radia Schmidt arbitrarily characterizes me as a usurper of the Holy Grail.

Olivia served Tuan, so the logic seems to be that Tuan's holy object, Tiamata, should belong to Olivia.

"...... is Olivia's."

"......what?"

"It's jointly owned. I can't show you right here, but this tiara is both mine and Olivia's. I guess you could say we were soul-bonded at the same time. Oh, she's not going to like me saying this....... But what can you do, so to speak......."

I chuckle and whisper in Radia Schmidt's ear.

"Olivia and I, we're like soul mates."

"Yi, yi, yi, yi, you impious, lowly maggot, how dare you speak such impure words to Tuan's deputy!"

Tuan's proxy.

One minute it's the Throne of the Millennium, the next it's Tuan's proxy?

What the hell does this crazy bitch think Olivia is?

It was as if the Goddess of Purity couldn't accept that I was in some sort of soul-bond with her.

"Devil! Give me back the Tiamata! It's not meant to be held by the likes of you! The Tiamata has been passed down from generation to generation to the priests and paladins of Tuan, not for unbelievers like you!"

"You're sure it's soundproof, right?"

"Yes, it is."

I found this quite amusing.

Deep down, I was thinking that if I showed him the Tiamata, he might fall down and apologize.

This reaction was not unexpected, but it was also interesting to see that the hatred of me was amplified by seeing Tiamata.

Radia Schmidt is not a faithful servant of God.

He's one of those people who just understands and accepts God on his own terms.

That's why they don't want to admit they're wrong, which is why they say such nonsense.

If I am unfit, why did Tuan allow me to become the master of Tiamata?

Then we have to admit that Tuan is incomplete.

Right now, Radia doesn't want to admit she's wrong, so she's saying that Tuan made a mistake.

Fanaticism is nothing more than self-suggestion.

Humans just need logic to defend themselves.

So maybe Radia Schmidt isn't so much acknowledging God as she is acknowledging her own beliefs that led her to kill me.

Fanaticism is not faithful, steadfast belief and faith, it is literally insane belief.

Fanaticism cannot be faithful.

I'm not going to get into a discussion about faith and God with Radia Schmidt, who has cognitive dissonance.

Radia Schmidt gave me a chance.

Stay away from Olivia.

Because I refused, Radia Schmidt tried to kill me.

I gave it the same chance.

I am the champion of Tuan, the one you seek to kill, and yet you do it.

Radia Schmidt claims I'm the one who stole Tiamata through some dirty trick, and she doesn't believe I co-own it with Olivia, and she'll be even crazier when she finds out.

I feel that my very existence is a threat to Olivia's innocence.

"I don't know by what dirty trick you stole the tiara that was supposed to be Olivia's, but there will be hell to pay!"

It's even convinced of it now. It will constantly create words and logic to defend itself.

"I'll make you regret it! I don't know what you did with that evil wizard......."

-Bam!

"Yuck!"

I smashed the head of a loud-mouthed Radia Schmidt with the sword face of Tiamata.

"Shut up. From now on, answer when I ask."

"......."

"A thousand-year empire. What is it?"

"......."

"You're a dumbass. You want a taste of power?"

"Do not discuss the power of God with your lowly and impious mouth!"

"...... doesn't make sense."

I glanced in Elise's direction.

"I'm sorry, Elise."

"Yes."

You're going to die anyway.

There's nothing to hide.

"Can't you get him to listen to me? I mean, even if he's not listening, he's so full of energy."

"......."

She stared at me for a moment, then walked softly toward me. She stood beside me, wordlessly, and pressed her face against the bound face of Radia Schmidt.

"Do I have to hide everything?"

I know what I'm talking about.

"Uh."

Elyse seemed to take a deep breath, then closed her eyes and opened them.

"!"

Bloodshot eyes and slit black pupils were revealed. Radia Schmidt's lips quivered in horror at the overwhelming sight.

"배....... 배....... Vampire....... Vampire......? Uh, how about....... How about....... How about......?"

Radia looks back and forth between me and Eleris. She still can't believe her eyes when she sees me with the Tiamata and a vampire as a minion.

Yes.

In fact, Radia Schmidt got a lot wrong, but she also got a lot right.

No, rather, it's scaled back.

You're the devil.

I'm not the devil, I'm the devil and worse.

I can only be worse than whatever Radia Schmidt imagines and defines as evil.

Radia had underestimated me.

Radia Schmidt was on the verge of losing her mind as things kept pushing the limits of her imagination.

After revealing her identity, Eleris brings her face as close as possible to Radia Schmidt's, and stares into her eyes.

"I am a Lord Vampire, and my name is Eleris, Lord of the Seven Nights."

"a....... ah....... ah......."

Radia Schmidt was already terrified of what was beyond her comprehension.

"Even if you don't tell me anything, I can turn you into my slave with a single drink of your blood and find out everything. No matter how strong your will, resistance will be futile."

"Ah....... ugh. Ugh....... Ugh....... Uh......."

"Do you want to live as a human with a secret that's going to come out anyway, or do you want to spend the rest of your life as a vampire because you're hiding it?"

Elise whispers, her eyes boring into Radia Schmidt's eyeballs.

"Select."

Secrets are meaningless in my presence.

Eleris hammers it into Radia Schmidt's head.



* * *



"You, you are....... You. What the hell are you....... what?"

"You're right, it's not maggots, but something like the devil."

"Malo....... Maldo. Nonsense. Nonsense....... How....... a thing like you....... on the temple......."

"You're ridiculous. You call me the devil, and then you say I'm the devil, and then you say it doesn't make sense? What do you mean, you call me the devil when you know I'm not?"

"......."

You may have called me the devil, but you didn't really think it was anything like that.

The Lord Vampire, a mere minion of mine, was able to subdue him in one fell swoop. You think I'm even more formidable.

I didn't need to be told that she was much stronger than I was, although that's what she is.

"I'm going to ask you for the second time what the Millennium is, and if you don't tell me, I'm going to turn you into a vampire."

At my words, Radia Schmidt's complexion almost bleached out.

"Do you think you can kill yourself if you become a vampire? You live or die at the will of your master, and if you want to be a vampire priest or something, go ahead."

I don't know how vassalage and slavery actually work, but I'm just going by what I think.

Radia Schmidt is in a panic anyway, so she'll believe anything she's told, regardless of the facts.

What Radia was doing to me earlier was framing me, but now it's an illusion.

He's far more powerful than an active paladin, and yet he's so easily subdued, and that's all his minions can do.

Me with such a minion.

An unidentified being with a Tiamata who calls himself something akin to the Devil.

From now on, it's not an accusation, it's an illusion.

You'll start to think of me as something beyond your wildest dreams.

It's impossible to keep a secret.

Radia shuddered at the thought of being turned into a vampire.

You may have imagined yourself destroying such a being, but you may not have thought about yourself becoming one.

If you become a vampire, there's no point in trying to kill yourself. You'll be ruled by your thoughts.

From a promising Paladin of Alth to a creature that feeds on human blood and lives in the darkness of the night.

Radia shuddered, her whole body trembling with fear and shame at the mere thought of it.

Secrecy can be a powerful thing sometimes.

If you eventually realize there's no point in hiding it, it's too easy to admit it.

There are no exceptions, not even for secrets that are worthy of death.

"Chu, chu....... "The millennium is....... On the 'Priory with no name'....... The plan you are pursuing....... is......."

Before I knew it, Radia Schmidt was using superlatives.



* * *



The Order of the Nameless.

Another unfamiliar concept was introduced, and the look on Radia Schmidt's face as she spoke it was a mixture of devastation, misery, and horror.

"What is this nameless order?"

"Meaningful....... A group of people from each of the five major sects and organizations....... faith communities......."

"So the purpose of this nameless order is to unite the forces of the Five Great Houses and establish a religious state. And you plan to make Olivia Ranze its first king?"

"To summarize, yes......."

He seemed to have a lot to say, but was afraid to say it out of fear.

Elise and I had to get serious.

"Doesn't that make them any different than Republicans, except for their temper?"

"I see......."

Within the Five Great Houses, a group of extremists called the Order of the Unnamed were attempting to establish a state separate from the Empire.

Judging by its success, I'm guessing they want to build an empire-like system.

"Do you know what the scale is?"

"......."

I clicked my tongue as Radia shook her head and pursed her lips.

"Don't try to sneak it in. If I don't think so, I'll turn you into a vampire to prove it."

"Oh, no, no, no, I will never, ever, ever mix lies!"

Radia shook her head wildly as she was bound, wondering if being a vampire was worse than dying.

"We're not a big force right now, but we're continuing to....... and growing. Internally, we will soon....... that we will have a power level equivalent to one of the Five Great Shinto sects....... we expect."

"......itis."

"That's a big deal."

Fortunately, it seems like they're still small, but the speed at which they're expanding their faction is staggering.

Soon, we'll be the size of a denomination.

And it's not just one denomination, it's within the Crusader Knights and the Great Houses. The radicals, minus the moderates, are already a group that has the power to influence the entirety of the Five Great Houses.

The situation was worse than we thought.

Revolutionary forces, then religious forces.

"This is crazy......."

I grabbed her by the hair, and she sighed as if the earth had gone to hell.

Empire is a myth.

If the revolutionary forces and this gun go off at the same time, the Empire will be torn in four.

Radia didn't seem to understand the situation.

I think you're pretty sure that me and Eleris are evil, but I can see that you're very uneasy about the situation with the Empire in crisis.

You'd be more surprised if you knew the truth.

The devil and his minions are scrambling to figure out what to do about the empire.

Still, it sounds like a crazy, crazy idea.

"How long has this nameless order been around, anyway?"

I get that it's a religious secret society, but I wanted to clarify whether it's a recent expansion or something that's been around for a while, like a revolutionary faction. If they've been around for a while, why the recent explosion?

"...... has only been up for a short time."

"Yeah, but why are there so many people there?"

"......because of religious repression."

What the hell is this?

At my words, Radia Schmidt grits her teeth and shakes her head.

"The former head of the Crusaders, Lord Revere Lance, has fallen from grace, and the Empire has begun a religious crackdown to keep the Crusaders in check....... Many members of the church believe this."

"Ah."

The words painted a picture.

To those who don't know the real story, the disappearance of war hero Leverier Ranze may seem like a big deal.

No.

"......Was it Leverier Lancet who created the nameless order?"

"......."

Radia Schmidt's silence says it all.

"I guess so."

That's already the answer.

"I don't think there are many members of the church who believe that, but I think that's what Leverier Ranze has been rumored to have done, and that he's done it because of political pressure, regardless of what he actually did."

"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!"

"Shut up. You're a Temple student, you know what's going on."

"It was an unavoidable....... to set a wavering Olivia back on the right path."

"Oh, shit. Shut up."

"......."

I believe that everything that Leverier Ranze did to Olivia was justified in the first place. I don't want to talk to Radia Schmidt anymore about this.

I was lost, I didn't know where I was or what I was doing, and I was creating secret societies and doing bullshit.

So, in the end, this is an inflection point in history, an event that happened because of Olivia Ranze's survival.

Yes.

After all, this shit is my shit too.

Darn.

So does Olivia, so does Charlotte.

Do people whose very existence is an inflection point in history have to go through these crises again?

If Levereer Lance had remained in his position as Crusader Master, nothing would have happened. That said, Leviathan Lance did indeed have ambitions to make the Five Great Houses independent of the Empire and establish a Holy Empire. But he wouldn't have been able to do it in a hurry, so it's not relevant to the main story.

But when he fell out of power, he turned to secret societies.

Leverier Ranche would have argued that his removal was a political crackdown on religion, which would have fueled a backlash from religious figures.

The logic of creating a country for religious people to escape the external pressures led them to form a secret society called the Order of the Unnamed.

Capitalizing on this sense of victimization, Levereer Ranze is now growing its ranks to frightening proportions.

It was also backed up by his own achievements as a hero of the Demon War.

At this rate, they'll create a faction the size of a sect of the Five Great Houses, and they'll be able to grab the Five Great Houses by the roots and shake them.

Levereer Ranze wants Olivia to be crowned High Priestess.

It's tempting to put yourself in that position, but it would be ridiculous.

If I create a Holy Empire and say I'm going to be its first Emperor, my sincerity will be questioned.

But if you have to build a country of gods and put a foster daughter in there who's talent, character, and ability may or may not make it to the continent once, and she's the only one who deserves it, then you have a rationale.

Also, the lottery for the Leviathan can only be won by Olivia's mouth.

If you deny that you were wronged by Revere Lance, all of Revere Lance's accusations will be framed by the Empire, regardless of the truth.

Having seen her in action, it's almost as if Olivia is a raison d'être.

He wants to sit himself, but he doesn't want to appear greedy, so he tries to make Olivia a success.

Perhaps the reason Leviathan is so obsessed with Olivia is that she is both a cause and a revenge for him.

"You son of a bitch."

As I spoke through clenched teeth, Radia Schmidt became even more frightened.

This can't be left alone.

The Leviathan, as well as the nameless Order, are the seeds of great turmoil.

We need to wipe them out. If you don't do it now, while they're still small, you won't be able to do anything about them later.

But in what way? If you get the imperial court to act by accusing them of conspiracy to rebel, you're actually creating a religious persecution that never happened.

The moderates would quickly turn into extremists.

The mere fact that imperial and governmental powers are involved in this is already a recipe for massive conflict.

First, you need to organize your thoughts. You need to think about how and where you want to dig in.

"Okay, last one. Was it the order of the nameless monks that tried to kill me?"

Radia Schmidt genuinely wanted to kill me. But he also wanted to kill me, and he may have been ordered to.

At my words, Radia Schmidt shook her head.

"Oh, no....... This is....... It's my dogma......."

"Are you sure you're not lying because you're afraid I'm going to fuck with them?"

"No, no, no, whoa, I had a different plan, it's my dogma!"

Radia Schmidt on how much she hates being a vampire.

"Yeah, so what's your plan?"

"......."

Radia Schmidt struggles to speak.

But eventually, because he knows what I'm going to say, he opens his mouth to spit it out.

"Adriana....... Adriana was a sophomore at Temple....... The Priory is taking her in......."

"......what?"

I felt like my head went white and blank when I saw a name I had never imagined.

Why would Adriana do that?

Why is Adriana being mentioned here?

Adriana's image flashed through my mind. The last memory of their walk together near the Artouan Monastery flashes through my mind.

What are they trying to do to Adriana?

No, what did I do?

"Tell me more."

If I had a leash of reason.

Just now, it broke.



* * *



Olivia was in her dorm room.

It was getting close to the start time for the Miss Temple contest, and Olivia should have gotten to the venue early to get ready, but Reinhardt told her to wait in her room.

I don't know what he was trying to do, but he seemed to have an idea.

Still, she should leave soon, if not sooner. She didn't know what Reinhardt was going to do, but if she didn't hear anything in the next half hour or so, Olivia would leave for the tournament.

-Smart

A knock on the door made Olivia jump out of her seat.

"Reinhard, what the hell is......?"

"......?"

But it wasn't Reinhardt who knocked on Olivia's door, it was a dorm user.

"Oh, I'm sorry."

The maid smirked and handed Olivia something.

"I don't know who you're waiting for, but it's a letter, Miss Olivia."

"Oh....... Yeah."

Olivia took the letter from the maid and closed the visit.

There was no sender, just an address. Who would send a letter like this?

Olivia opened the envelope.

There were only two lines of text on it.



[Daughter, do you remember the name Adriana?]

[He's with me now].



"!"

The only person who can call herself a daughter is Levereer Ranze.

I don't know why, and I don't know how, but he has Adriana now.

Reinhardt, Adriana, and Ivia in first-year B class.

The three of them played a crucial role in saving his life. Now it's word of mouth and everyone knows about it.

This means that the three of them played a crucial role in Leverier Lance's demise.

Reinhard and Ivia are Temple students, which means they are dangerous to touch, and Adriana would have been relatively easy for Leviathan to reach.

Whatever the reason, revenge or otherwise, Leviathan has Adriana now.

The sender's name was not listed, only the address to which the letter was sent.

It must have meant come here.

Adriana is the bait, and Yangbu calls himself.

I don't know what he's trying to say, or what he's trying to do to Adriana.

The child who saved my life is now in danger for saving his own.

Olivia jumped out of her seat as if mesmerized and opened the dormitory door.

"What the heck....... Why the hell......."

What the heck do you expect from yourself.

Why do we do this.

Olivia clenched her teeth and ran down the hallway of her dorm.

I've already erased the whole Miss Temple thing from my mind.
