A letter to the war chest.

At a time when supplying requires the magic of mass teleportation, letters are quite a luxury supply.

Nonetheless, letters arrive at regular intervals.

A letter to the troops asking them how their families are doing would be a huge morale booster, reminding them of the people they're supposed to be protecting.

Of course, with a large army, the number of letters asking for well wishes could be so high that it would disrupt the supply of other critical items.

Normally, yes.

Unfortunately, many soldiers have lost family members who need to be able to communicate with them.

Therefore, the number of letters arriving is small and, ironically, they are not very long, which is why the General Headquarters is able to deliver them only occasionally.

After Lanyon Sessor's performance, Heinrich headed to his barracks in Lindt.

The letters were already categorized by recipient.

In the barracks were Kono Lindt, Heinrich, Klippmann, and Erich de Lapaeri.

Cliffman was rifling through the letters with his usual cold expression.

"And Kaier?"

Erich shrugged at Lindt's question.

"You're probably hugging the crystal tower. I don't think he's coming. He said he was going to sleep there tonight."

A large-scale magic storage artifact called an Arc Crystal.

Despite Redina's daily berating, Caier is also responsible for the only thing he can do.

They're not doing what they should be doing, but they're not doing what they should be doing.

It's just that when the inevitable happens, you know that hating each other isn't the answer, but you can't help but hate.

The best duo, but they hate each other.

"Well, I'll pass this along."

Kono Lint held up a few letters from Kaier, then blinked once and disappeared.

-Whoosh!

Once again, there was no letter in Konorint's hand as he appeared out of thin air.

He traveled to the Arc Crystal and handed over the letter.

"Wow, you've grown up a lot."

Kono Lindt chuckles at Erich's comment.

"Yeah, I'm a little big. If you ask me."

Erich and Heinrich laughed at Konor Lindt's comment.

It's not the same as it used to be.

Long gone are the days of only being able to teleport naked. There is no longer a penalty to Kono Lint's ability.

"By the way, you're the most numerous again."

Lindt's words made Heinrich sit up.

The most letters are addressed to Heinrich.

It's a bit, well, weird.

Most of the letters in this room are not from family members.

Conor Lindsay, Erhido, and Cliffmando.

There's no such thing as a letter from home, because they've all been displaced by the Gate.

Not all of them saw their family members die, but at some point they had to accept that they were no longer in this world.

The sadness and anger about it is there, but it doesn't come out.

But the letter is there, in front of Erich, in front of Conor Lindt, and in front of Klippmann.

The most of them reached Heinrich.

Erich crosses his arms and laughs.

"The guy who saves the most lives among us gets the most letters, of course."

This was a letter from the people they saved.

"No, technically, I've saved a lot of people, too. It's hard to kill a monster, and there's no one like me in rescue operations."

Erich chuckled at Konor Lindt's comment.

"You know what, it's more shocking to see a horde of monsters burned to death right in front of you, and you're whizzing around, so people don't even know you've been rescued, so it's more like Heinrich, isn't it?"

Konorint sighs heavily and picks up a letter envelope.

"...... That's right, Chet."

In the Royal Class garrison, Heinrich is the most common recipient of letters.

Not Ellen.

Letters to Ellen are too many to begin with, and she doesn't even deliver them.

If Ellen gets it, she can't read it, and if she starts delivering it, it'll disrupt other supply shipments; the postal service has a sign warning that they can't deliver letters to Ellen.

So it was inevitable that Heinrich, the next most famous person after Ellen, would receive the most letters.



[Hi, Heinrich. I don't know if you remember me, but I'm Seria, and you saved my life in Aristotle about a year ago. I wrote to you last time, but I don't know if you got it].



To be honest, Heinrich doesn't remember the faces of the people he saved.

Because there were too many.

But when they mention the region, Heinrich's memory of what he did there, how many people died there, and how many people he saved is a blur.

The letter writers were children, adults, and soldiers who had once served with Heinrich.

Letters from soldiers who are no longer able to fight. Those who were mortally wounded and crippled because they were not treated in time.

They send a letter wishing Heinrich well.

Some people don't stop with one get-well letter; they write periodically.

Heinrich doesn't know their faces, but he remembers their names.

I can't afford to do that now, but when I was based in the ecliptic, I used to take the time to reply from time to time.

The letters vary in content, but in the end they all express gratitude for Heinrich and wish him well.

Heinrich tries to read every letter that comes his way.

When Heinrich has seen so many deaths that he sometimes despairs, wondering what the point of it all is, these letters remind him that what he has been doing has never been for nothing.

So just as they find hope in Heinrich, he finds hope in these letters.

That I can live with it somehow.

That I can survive somehow.

So Heinrich reads the letter with a pensive expression.

Kono Lint and Erich read all the letters that arrived.

Erich was also a bit of an athlete at the start of his program, but he didn't really hold his own.

But talent.

It's the talented few who get into the royal class.

Talent is rare.

In addition to the growth amplifier of Moonshine, Erich had to gain a ton of hands-on experience.

As a result, Erhi de Lapaeri has gained a level of combat prowess and divine power comparable to that of a high-ranking paladin in the Crusader Knights.

They're hand-picked from every continent.

It's only natural that such talent would grow so quickly. It's inevitable, even inevitable, that someone will achieve a level of mastery in a short period of time that would take decades of bone-crunching work.

Even within the Royal Class, Erhi's rate of progression to High Paladin in just a few years is rather moderate.

Comparing Ellen and Reinhardt to anyone else is a bit of a stretch. They are in a different league than anyone else.

One is a warrior, the other a demon.

Aside from those two, there are a few others who are growing too fast, even within the royal class.

A good example of this would be someone like Klippmann, who received more letters than Heinrich in this position, or Ludwig, number B-11.

They had awakened to the power of magic on their own before the events of the Gate. With Moonshine's assistance, they're already on the cusp of mastery.

The two of them had such a refined ability to manipulate power and magic that they could probably reach a master class before the year was out.

In some cases, like Delphine Isadra, who awakened a new power, Elementalism.

Scarlett, for example, was considered a top-tier power, if not as good as Ludwig and Klippmann.

Cliffman read the letters with a stoic expression, crumpling them up and stuffing them into his pocket.

"I'll be there."

As Klippmann turns to leave the barracks, Lint speaks to him behind his back.

"Hey, but how long are you going to operate alone? You used to be able to do that, but now you're moving with an army. There are limits to solo action."

"......."

At Lindt's call, Klippmann stood in place and fell silent.

After a moment, Klippmann says briefly.

"I'm better off alone."

"No matter how confident you are, you're going to get yourself killed."

"Well......."

Cliffman mumbles to himself.

"It's always worked out somehow, so it will always work out somehow."

With those strange words, Klippmann left the barracks. Konorint smiled bitterly as he watched Klippmann leave the barracks.

"I'm afraid I'm going to die in a really bad place with that......."

"Leave her alone. I think she's got a superpower."

Erich sighed heavily at Konor Lindt's words.

"I think so, but I don't know if it's possible......."

Cliffman in Combat Talent.

The purpose of talent is to win.

Winning somehow is a function of the Combat talent.

"If you're like me, and you've had a few experiences where everyone in your unit dies and you're the only one who comes back alive, it's scary to lead a unit."

"That's right, but......."

Combat is always variable.

You may encounter unexpected circumstances, too many enemies, or too many unreasonable enemies.

During the long, long years of dealing with the gate crisis, there were countless units that were decimated because they couldn't handle the variables.

He killed a lot of monsters and saved a lot of people during the Clifford's Gate crisis.

And I found myself in a lot of unexpected situations.

There have been operations where I've been with, and sometimes led, units that have been wiped out, and even master classes.

There were times when I faced enemies that were moderately powerful, and other times when I faced enemies that were too powerful.

Cliffman has come close to death many times.

But each time, Cliffman somehow survived.

In the midst of the murder and slaughter of men far stronger than he, Cliffman crushed, tore, and crushed the creatures and survived alone.

Opinion is divided on who killed the most monsters.

Maybe it's Ellen, maybe it's Saviolin Tana, maybe it's Rhydyne.

But when asked who performed the most miracles, the answer was always Clifford, not Ellen.

Ellen and Clifford, it seems, always win.

But the process is different.

Ellen was always stronger than her enemies.

Their attacks could not penetrate Ellen, and her Voidblade always tore through the monsters' flesh with ease.

But Cliffman is different.

Cliffman often faced enemies who were stronger than he was, and who were out of his league.

Still, we won.

I always came back with a victory in my hand.

However, I've had several experiences where my coworkers didn't come back.

So at some point, Klippmann began to move on his own.

If it is your talent to win at all costs, and if that talent only protects your life.

You don't have to take someone with you.

If combat is a talent of some supernatural power beyond what you're already gifted with, throw yourself into a random battlefield where you always win somehow.

We're going to win somehow.

So you don't need a coworker.

That was Kliffman's argument.

Of course, I wouldn't trust the Imperial Household or the High Command with such supernatural powers and just throw Cliffman out there in the middle of nowhere. It would be like investing certain power in an uncertain force and leaving it to die.

As such, Cliffman travels alone.

It's one thing to always do what you can do with competencies, but it's another to somehow do what you can't do with competencies.

On a battlefield where even the mightiest among us are dying, Cliffman somehow manages to make it out alive.

While everyone in the Royal Class is unusual, everyone agrees that Klippmann is a particularly unusual talent.

Of course, that depression and despair, that feeling of carrying death on your shoulders, was clearly felt by everyone watching Cliffman.

Klippmann returns to his barracks, and Heinrich reads the letters left for him.

Everyone had already read all the letters that had come my way, so Kono Lint and Erich talked to each other.

"What should we name the baby?"

"......What the hell?"

"No, there's this girl who writes to me every month or so. She obviously likes me. I can't remember her face, but I think she's a girl."

"......What the hell do you want me to say?"

"Why don't I ask to see you after the war, and you'll meet me if I reply?"

"You should meet him....... Why don't you ever change?"

"It is said that if a man becomes imprudent, he dies."

Kono Lint still has its quirks.

Heinrich can hear the conversation even as he reads the letter, and he chuckles.

It's probably a good thing in a situation like this that the old, immature me remains.

Suddenly, Heinrich sees that only one last letter remains.

It was a strange letter.

Most of the time, the letters had the sender's name on them. And most of them had names Heinrich couldn't remember.

The addressee is Heinrich von Schwarz.

But the sender.



[From a friend].



It said friends.

Heinrich has no friends outside of this garrison.

Shaking his head, Heinrich tore open the envelope.

You feel like it's from someone who claims to be your friend.

But when Heinrich saw it, his eyes widened.

It's not a thank you for saving my life.

It's not about what kind of friend you are.



[Your brothers will kill you].



In the letter, there was just that one line.
