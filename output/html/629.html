            Episode 629.





Night time.

-tab

The wooden cup clinks against the table with a dull thud.

-tab

Once again.

-Tap, tap

And then again twice.

-tab

The owner of the cup was clinking his wooden cup against the table.

Across from him was Rowen, the leader of the Crusader Knights, wearing robes and a hood that gave away the fact that he was a sneaky guest.

And the master of the barracks.

Louise von Schwarz tapped her wooden cup against the table.

It was an unintelligible behavior.

She'd let the crusader captain in in the middle of the night, but Louise was acting in ways that made no sense.

"Do you want me to come back later?"

If you don't want to talk, I'll come back whenever you feel like it," Rowen said, looking at Louise with a wide smile.

Louise remained still, and instead of answering, slid the wooden cup in front of her.

"......?"

Suddenly, Louise pushed the glass toward her, and Rowen couldn't help but look dumbfounded.

"Are you giving me that?"

"As you wish."

It wasn't until Louise looked at the cup pushed in front of her that she realized it contained a liquid.

It contained a milky, opaque liquid.

A glass handed to you out of nowhere, and a liquid you don't know what it is.

Rowen lifted the glass and downed it in one gulp.

Louise watched Rowen drain her glass with a grimace.

"Ugh......."

Emptying his glass, Rowen set the wooden cup down, covered his mouth, and took a few breaths.

"I drank it because I don't care if it's ...... poison. I'd rather it be poison. What is this?"

Eek, eek.

While.

She made a gagging sound.

"It's so thick, sour, and slimy. It's so offensive....... What the......."

Rowen, whose expression never crumples, shudders.

"Is this alcohol?"

Bottom line.

It was a strange liquid that I didn't recognize, but couldn't call alcohol.

Louise nodded wordlessly.

"The priests of Tuan also have a precept against drinking."

Malicious.

The taste of the alcohol itself is one thing, but the fact that you offered it is another.

"I heard there's also a precept of non-killing."

"That's right."

Rowen nodded nonchalantly.

It's odd that an Inquisitor who tortured and killed so many people would bring up the precepts in the first place.

"There will also be a precept for chastity."

"You're doing surprisingly well with that, aren't you?"

Louise stares into the face of the frail Crusader leader.

"By the way, I see you're a fan of this kind of drink, Commander, and I'll be the first to apologize if my reaction earlier was rude."

The world is a big place, and I'm sure there's a town somewhere that drinks this foul stuff. Rowen first apologized for his frown, saying that he could understand if the Princess of Cernstadt was sipping this foul liquor alone in her barracks.

But Louise shook her head.

"No way, I don't know of any such nasty traditional liquor."

"Um......? No?"

"Yes and no."

"Then may I ask why you drink this nasty stuff?"

Rowen didn't understand why he was drinking this weird liquor all by himself, and it wasn't even traditional.

"This is the secret wine."

"Oh....... Really?"

"Yeah, they confiscated the soldiers' dip."

That's why he was staring at the liquid in the glass, not emptying it.

"It's crazy. You're feeding an army out of people's blood and tears, and someone's making a drink out of it. I guess you could say that's hard work......."

Louise bites her lip.

"Isn't it pitiful......."

Even liquor that tastes so bad that it's unbearable is still called liquor, and you brew it and drink it.

"What do you think we should do with the soldiers who have been drinking?"

Louise stares at Rowen, still.

"We'll have to kill it."

"Why kill?"

"Because food is precious."

"Why is food precious?"

"If you don't have it, you'll starve, right?"

"Are you saying that I should kill it because it has damaged a life and death item?"

"Right?"

Louise stares at Rowen.

Louise was speechless, just staring.

You pointed to the moon, so you should look at the moon.

Don't point fingers.

But that's impossible and pointless.

Anyone can say the right things.

So, why does it matter that anyone can point to the moon.

It doesn't matter who's pointing, the moon doesn't mean anything in the first place.

"Do you want to keep them alive?"

At Rowen's naturally virtuous question, Louise shook her head.

"What are you talking about, I already killed it."

"......But why do you ask?"

The conclusion had already been drawn and enforced, so the question was meaningless in the first place.

There were soldiers who owed liquor.

The soldiers who made it somehow.

The soldiers who secretly shared it.

Ruiz ordered them to be killed.

I confiscated all the bootlegged liquor they were making and took a drink.

It was just a horribly tasteless and unpleasant white liquid.

I died trying to make something like this.

"Those who have stolen food so far have had their heads beaten off......."

Louise looks at Rowen.

"The bitch who stole so many lives and stole the entire Order of the Gods is the head of the Crusader Knights, and she's walking around with her head held high......."

"And."

"I am such a mean, evil, thieving bitch."

"I can't even hold a bucket of cold water, let alone a knife."

The little thieves were punished.

For small thieves, the most severe punishment was to take their lives.

But with a thief this big, you can't even ask him about the theft.

So why did the little thieves have to die.

Why they had to die.

What killed them.

Only the little ones get stepped on.

No, only the little ones were stepped on.

In the end, Louise had to bite her tongue.

My brothers were dead by my hand, and I had no one to blame but myself.

In the end, it's just a different kind of swearing in the mirror.

Louise could say something, but not saying anything would only make her feel worse.

Louise von Schwarz, self-loathing, bitter, and angry, stares at the crusader through blurred eyes.

"That's it. Tell me what you want."

Rowen sees Louise posture for conversation and whispers quietly in the barracks, where the sour aroma of wheat wine wafts through the air.

"The devil has chosen you."

"......."

Louise is silent.

She'd known this was coming.

Choice, how the devil can say that now.

No, it's not the devil, it's the messenger.

The look on the devil worshipper's face as he spoke, as if to say thank you, as if to say please, was telling.

Louise didn't answer for a very long time.

How much time has passed.

Louise opens the barrel beside her and scoops out a bowl of moonshine.

And drink it.

Just like you can't go without drinking.

It's like drinking poisoned wine.

Moonshine.

You drink the liquid, whose name has now been stolen by something else.

A clique, not a monopoly.

After drinking a bowl of such bootlegged liquor, the corners of her mouth twitch, and her clear eyes murmur.

"Terrible....... flavor."

How sweet is a drink made of blood and tears.

"If we get past Cernstadt, it's like we get half the Allied army."

I couldn't help but shake my head at Charlotte's words.

"......It's not half bad, is it?"

"Can't I see that the actual size is not that large? Yes, the actual Allied forces in Cernstadt are less than half, and technically less than a quarter."

"So."

Charlotte and I were sitting alone in Razak's senate chamber, talking.

"But let's say a small country, a province, an empire with a thousand troops, sided with us. What do you think will happen the moment he says, "I'm going to side with the devil from now on?"

"...... I wouldn't do that unless I wanted to die, but if I did, I'd be glad to die a nice death."

"It's going to get slimy, right?"

"Yeah, right."

It's obvious that if a group of people with no size or power were to suddenly declare their support for the devil, they'd have their heads cut off in an instant.

Are we talking about the Great Hemp Fire?

"When a monarch of a small country does something like that, you're like, 'Oh, he's crazy,' but when a big country like Cernstadt makes a decision like that, people are going to think, 'Why would a country the size of Cernstadt support the devil at this time, because he's crazy,' and they're going to think, 'Oh, he's crazy,' or they're not going to think."

"You mean ......?"

Otherwise, I wonder if there's smoke in the chimney.

If a large country like Cernstadt were to suddenly make such a decision, there would be fierce criticism, but also a great deal of shock.

Why the hell would Cernstadt.

What's missing?

"But why just Cernstadt, we have the Order of the Lord?"

"Right."

Let's say the Church of the Gods declares its support for the Demon King at the same time.

1First Empire, Cernstadt.

Cult of the Lord.

It's not one crazy person, it's two.

Cernstadt is the largest state outside of the Empire.

The Church of the Lord is a force that transcends nations.

When those two groups start openly supporting the devil, you know something serious is going on.

"Everyone has to choose, support the empire or support the devil."

The idea of humanity supporting a demon is insane in the first place.

But when the two great powers make it public, humans have to seriously consider whether or not to support the demon.

Of course, it's not the majority of humanity that's worried, but the leaders and heads of the factions.

You'll do whatever it takes to survive.

There will be those who will say that you can fight tooth and nail, but you can never be on the enemy's side.

There will be forces that will claim to be on your side, claiming that survival is the absolute good.

The devil wins, or the empire wins.

Those who want to survive need to start predicting.

So Charlotte wasn't wrong when she said that half the time.

The moment they realize that two giant powers are on their side, there will be massive chaos and leaders will start betting.

Cernstadt isn't actually half of it, but a shaken and rearranged faction map would have more than half of it on my side.

"It's funny, it wasn't that long ago that everyone was dying to kill me, and now I can do this."

"How often do you serve a king you hate so much you want to kill him because he's your king?"

"I don't think there's anything wrong with ......."

As much as I assume there will be those who will fight me to the death, there will also be those who will crawl under the devil's feet to survive.

We don't know if the former will be the majority or the latter, but we do know that the latter will not be a small number.

"Anyway, all of this is predicated on Louise von Schwarz endorsing me, which she hasn't done......."

"Right."

Louise von Schwarz.

It was Charlotte who suggested that we should bring her on board first for future work.

It's ridiculous.

If I had remained silent, Louise von Schwarz would have died at the hands of Bertus. framed for the assassination of Heinrich.

In conclusion, Ruiz and Heinrich survived.

That's why I can see the potential for Ruiz to be on my side.

In conclusion, the Crusader Knights and the Five Great Houses alone can sway the Alliance, but without Louise von Schwarz, they will not be able to make a significant impact.

Let's start with the premise, and then we can paint a picture.

We've left it up to Rowen, but until we hear from him, we don't know what's going to happen.

"Maybe last year, but things are very different now, and she's learned quite a bit."

What empires do.

And that I have taken control of the Order.

We don't know if they even know what happened with Gate.

Louise knows that it's not at all strange for me to side with her at this point.

There's no reason for you to go to war with me.

And I know the tide is turning in my favor.

However, it doesn't really matter if Louise is aware of those nasty facts and truths or not.

Regardless of everything else, Louise knows she has to be on my side if she wants to survive.

"Louise von Schwarz will be on our side, surely."

Louise knows what the Emperor is thinking.

For that alone, Louise will be on my side.

Because she already knows who's going to win the fight.

It's not even a fight, you know.



* * *



Good or evil depends on who writes it.

That's why those in control of history have always been able to label something as good and something as evil.

So good and evil per se became meaningless, and in the end, it was all about who could control the pen.

So who was the real good in the end.

So who was the real evil in the end.

Talking about it will only keep you up at night.

Those who live and hold the pen will be the holders of justice and goodness.

Therefore, survival is justice and goodness.

The loser will be written off as evil.

It will be evil, not because it is evil, but because it has been defeated.

"......."

Louise von Schwarz wasn't just pondering in her long silence.

The conclusions are drawn and the choices are made.

You need to think about whether or not you can afford it.

Things twisted and turned, and Louise von Schwarz saw things with her own two eyes that she should never have seen or even known about, with unexpected effects in unexpected places.

Everything will belong to the devil.

Louise knows it.

Cernstadt, and the Order of the Lord.

By the time the Gate debacle is fully concluded, more than half of the Alliance will have pledged to side with the Devil.

At their head is Rowen, the leader of the Crusader Knights.

For the Inquisitor, who has enforced order with evil, trampled on doctrine, and maintained the order of the Church, establishing order with blood and lies is what he has always done.

Intimidation, blackmail, conspiracy, intrigue, intrigue, torture, brainwashing.

It's her job to be mean and dirty.

Rowen looks at the Princess of Cernstadt, who remains silent.

King Constantine was senile, so her decision was as good as Cernstadt's.

After a moment of silence, Louise spoke up.

"I need to set a condition."

"Conditions?"

"If that's acceptable, I'll stand by your side."

Louise didn't just decide to fall in line with their side.

"I can get that to you, what are the conditions?"

"You don't have to ask the devil's permission. Consent is something you do."

"......Do I have a say in the matter?"

"Of course."

Luiz's requirements were simple.

"The condition is, it's your life."

"Is that ......?"

Rowen's brow furrowed at the offhand remark.

Suddenly you're asking for your life.

"......I have nothing to offer, but did you really hate me that much?"

"I hate it, and I wish it were dead, but that's a whole other issue."

"How is it different?"

Louise giggles into a bowl of bootleg liquor, apparently enjoying the look of bewilderment on Rowen's face.

"Is the devil going to rule, not tyrannize?"

"We'll have to wait and see how it turns out, but I'm guessing you're going to do the latter."

"Then I'll need your life even more."

"......?"

At Rowen's seemingly incomprehensible demeanor, Louise began to giggle.

"No wonder."

It was a frivolous laugh.

"How can a madwoman who has led riots, instigated massacres, and killed countless people in her life as an inquisitor be of any use to the Demon King's rule?

"......."

"Do you think that the secrets of a master can be kept forever, when there are so many who know them?"

"......I don't think so."

"As helpful as you may be now, once the Demon World is complete, the last loyalty you can give is to face the Judgment Seat of the Purge, or rather, that is the only way your loyalty will be complete."

At that, Rowen's expression hardened eerily.

Rowen's role is limited to now.

Rowen, regardless of what her personality actually is, has done too much.

For the sins she has committed so far, she must be judged when the reign begins.

When peace begins, existence itself becomes a burden.

Therefore, Rowen would rather die than see the world she desires come to pass.

You must die to complete your allegiance.

Rowen's death is not necessary for Louise, but rather for the Devil.

That's why Louise, though selfless, has nothing to do with it, and makes her offer conditional on Rowen's death.

To Rowen, to the Devil, on the grounds that Rowen's death would make the Devil's power unclear in the future.

Convince her that she must die.

"A yin being who should be living in the shadows, meeting Nan Se and wearing epaulettes, must have really thought he could live in the yang, which is impossible."

Louise looks at her with a grim smile, as if she can't stand it.

Louise von Schwarz is the princess of Cernstadt.

First Princess of the First Empire and heir to the second largest country in the world.

A losing trade doesn't necessarily mean she gets nothing in return.

When it comes to maneuvering, intrigue, and scheming, Louise is naturally more comfortable.

"New head coach. The circumstances may be different, the position may be different, but will the fundamentals change?"

Even if you're the devil's lion now.

No matter how much authority you have in the moment.

The fundamentals don't change.

Louise is the princess and heir to a great nation.

She had to live in the shadows.

Just as a drink made by lowly people with lowly ingredients and forced by circumstance is bound to be a disgusting moonshine.

Cheesy is cheesy.

"How can moss grow on the sunny side?"

If a being from the yin zone comes to the yang zone without knowing the subject, it will wither and die.
