            Episode 502.





Riana was neutralizing the Death Knights one by one with lightning bolts, sniping at them from a distance, as if she could handle them.

I told him to stay out of it, but he must have thought I was dangerous.

-Quack! Flash!

You think it's all about you.

It's all their fault.

-Quack!

"Off!"

"......."

No match for me in strength, Olivia bounced off my sword and screamed like an animal.

The Death Knights charging at me are being held back by Riana.

Deathknights are the highest level of undead.

But Riana has slaughtered countless monsters in Fort Mokna so far, and has never failed to defend Fort Mokna.

And so it is with the Death Knights, as they are struck by the harsh lightning bolts summoned by Riana by the dozens, their tattered flesh scorched, their bones burning bright red until they are reduced to ash.

They are undead, but not long after death.

Some people have no face left.

Olivia is the head of the Holy Order, and after sending her priests here, she hasn't had much to do with them in person.

But Riana had commanded them for a long time, gone on missions with them, and spent a lot of time with them.

Riana probably knows best who she's killing twice right now.

He was paying for his sins by summoning dozens of lightning bolts into the bodies of his comrades-in-arms, turning their bodies to ash before they could die.

Olivia was possessed by an evil spirit, and the paladins sent on the purification mission were unable to die properly and were reborn as Death Knights.

You must fight not the monsters of the gate, but the things that were once your allies.

Riana made a mistake.

You have committed the unpardonable sin.

If so, I?

Trying to get your intentions judged is a miserable endeavor.

Just because your intentions were good, just because you were trying to save everyone.

After all, this all happened because of me, so is it really so absurd that a collection of spirits who hate me would borrow the body of someone so dear to me, Olivia, to condemn me?

As I justified in my own way.

I think their anger is justified.

For all the troubles in the world would not happen without me.

Perhaps their hatred of the devil as the cause of everything is not so unjust and unreasonable after all.

Even as the Death Knights were being neutralized one by one in a chain of thunderbolts, Olivia didn't stop.

With reason subdued, Olivia didn't look like she had a handle on swordsmanship.

"Off......."

He lets out a low cry like a beast, and wildly swings his halberd Tiamata at me like a club.

-Kang! kang! ka-kang!

It wasn't hard to parry his powerful swings.

But the wild swings weren't the problem, it was the power of corruption that Olivia wielded.

Taking Tiamata from Olivia's grasp made no difference. Taking Tiamata out of Olivia's grasp only takes away from the tempo of the fight, as Olivia takes her back.

Moreover, unlike me, Olivia could use her divine powers without Tiamata, making such a power struggle dangerous for me. Even if I took Tiamata away, Olivia would still use her powers of corruption and depravity.

Unable to hurt Olivia, I could only focus on keeping her at bay, and as such, my entire body was increasingly exposed to the aura of corruption and decay.

Necrosis begins in the skin and the whole body begins to die.

As my nerves die, my entire body becomes increasingly numb and my vision blurs.

You cannot use the healing power of Tiamata.

In a protracted battle, I will not die on the sword, but will be mummified alive by the power of corruption, as a plant withers.

Eventually, you'll have to make a move.

Something has to be done about those chunks of spirit controlling Olivia.

"Kaaaaaaaaaah!"

Once again, Olivia thrusts her sword at me, like a beast with a sword.

Avoiding it, brushing it off, just eats away at my body.

Throw a curveball.

-Ka-ching!

I grasp the blade of Tiamata, a magic sword tinged with the power of corruption, with my bare hands.

-qiibin!

As if dipped in an acidic solution, white smoke rises from your grip, and the hand that grasped the sword begins to die.

It's not just the sword.

-Bam!

"Off......."

I grabbed Olivia's nape with my other free hand.

Neither I nor Olivia can get away with this.

-Bang, bang, bang!

Olivia struggles and tries to escape my grasp, but in the end, I'm on top in terms of absolute physical output.

Olivia may be able to feed on me with her powers of corruption, after all, but she can't hurt me.

Tiamata is Olivia's, and it's mine.

Olivia holds the handle of the Tiamata, and I hold the katana.

Now that they're holding each other's stuff at the same time, they can't take it away from each other.

But my body is gradually dying.

"Tiamata......."

I turn to Tiamata, who has been turned into a magic sword by Olivia, who is subject to the will of spirits and demons.

"Be a holy sword."

When it came to killing Leviathan, I gave the exact opposite order.

-Flash!

As Tiamata pours out the energy of the Common Corruption, she returns to her original form, emitting a golden glow.

"Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"

As if the light itself was causing her immense pain, Olivia, who was being held by me, began to scream.

Gripping the hilt, not the handle, I twist Olivia's throat as she tries to get out of range of Tiamata's holy power, which has turned into a holy sword.

Olivia refused to let go of Tiamata in her pain.

The will to corrupt Tiamata.

Willingness to restore Tiamata to the Holy Sword.

The spirits clash with my will.

-Currrrr!

Emitting white and black energy at the same time, Tiamata smoldered in the open field.

It's a battle between my will and the wills of an unfathomable number of angry and resentful people.

You won't win.

I don't think a single will can overcome this much desire.

Nevertheless, I don't feel like losing.

We'll show it back.

I have no intention of letting go of anything I hold on to, much less the great winds of my dreams.

I'm ready to let go of myself.

I am not ready, nor do I intend to be, to abandon anyone who loves me, except myself.

No one who loves me.

No one I love.

No matter who it is.

If peace is only complete and attainable by abandoning someone.

I.

I don't need any of that.

I'll have it all.

With everything.

I'm going to finally crush these damn evils and get up.

It's getting pushed out.

The black energy emanating from Tiamata was gradually receding.

Clearly, it's pushing back.

"Turn off....... Aaaahhhhhh!"

As Olivia cries out in pain, possessed by the spirits, I hold her by the scruff of the neck to keep her from running away.

My right hand is already blackened to the wrist, but the dead hand that should have left my will refuses to let go of Olivia.

Hands?

That's it.

It's okay to lose.

If you can revert.

If there's any chance of getting it back.

We can do better than that.

"Get lost......."

Tiamatae held in the left hand.

To the spirits that have taken over Olivia's body.

"Fuck off....... you bastards!"

I cried out, not with a wish, but with a will.

-Flash!

The world was engulfed in a reddish glow, and I could finally see the demons pouring out of Olivia's body, unable to withstand the wind pressure of the divine power.



* * *



-Great!

The spirits eventually lost the battle for dominance to me, and fled to avoid exposure to Tiamata's divine power.

The expelled spirits clumped together in the air, forming a giant cloud.

It was floating in the sky, a gigantic figure, cowering, as if it had been struck by something.

Olivia was unconscious and limp, and I held her in my arms.

Something that big had taken control of Olivia's body.

The army of spirits floating in the air was larger than the mega-stadium I'd seen at the Temple.

Even if it's a soul, there's no way something that big can fit into a human body.

I couldn't help but wonder what the hell Olivia was dealing with.

How many numbers are there in the world?

-OffOffOffOff!

And it was getting bigger and bigger.

It's as if a desire attracts a desire.

Although I could not see the ghost with my own eyes, I could tell by the keenness of my senses that it was growing larger and larger, absorbing the spirits of the world with its very existence.

Like a black hole. As it grows larger, it will pull them in with even greater force.

The collection of spirits that resulted from Riana's massacre is just the beginning.

Now, regardless, I could only stare blankly up at the enormous, and growing enormous because it was enormous.

Only now could I somehow banish it from Olivia's body.

When that thing gets too big for me to handle, and the next thing I know it's on a rampage, will I be able to handle it?

How to do that.

How the hell do you do that on that scale.

Is it worth it to exorcise or purify?

The scale was overwhelming.

I can banish them, but I can't purify them with the holy power I have at my disposal. It would be impossible for Olivia, too.

What if that thing is trying to control someone other than Olivia.

Liana, Harriet, Charlotte, and Airi.

Or if you're stuck with Ellen.

I'll have to fight the battle I just did.

And those spirits would have been even bigger back then, so it might be impossible to deal with them as we do now.

And if it tries to kill me by borrowing someone else's body.

Do I have to watch the others try to kill me with the same look on their faces as Olivia did earlier?

I say, hugging Olivia, looking up at the writhing mass of souls.

"Why, why are you doing this?"

"If you don't like me, if you want to kill me, you can just try to kill me."

"Why, why are you doing this?"

What I have to deal with is what I want to deal with.

You might think their anger is justified.

So attack me. If those spirits attack me directly, that's it.

I shouldn't have to rely on the hands of people who love me to do this.

Izzie makes a reckless, nay, pointless move by speaking to a non-existent mass of resentment.

I have no idea what to do with this situation.

"Why......?"

But.

I heard the answer.

A gigantic mass of desire replies.

Like a bunch of beings shuffling around and saying the same thing.

No, it was more of an echo than a word.

The voices of so many overlapping beings echo across the field that a simple word can be heard.

"You, and only you. If you die....... ?"

His voice was filled with desperation and resentment.

-chiiiiing!

I can hear the souls stirring.

I felt a surge of emotion that I can only describe as palpable.

"Then why." "My son." "My husband." "My wife." "My brother." "My daughter."

"Mom." "Dad." "Lord." "My love." "Friends." "Hometown."

"Our."

"All."

"Girl."

"Take it all away."

"Why."

"I just want to give you one....... one?"

The words that came out at the same time were disjointed, but they all went into my mind, not my ears.

That can't be a single will. It's a collective mind.

It's like a group ritual.

They are pitiful, abominable beings, resonating with each other, united by a miserable bond of hatred, anger, and despair.

A collective named Resentment.

It stares down at me from thin air.

I could feel the clouds of giant spirits staring at me.

I could feel the resentful stare of those spirits, too many to count.

"Because you took everything we had."

"I'm going to take everything you have."

"That's....... right?"

"I will kill you, take everything you have, break and destroy you."

"For you have destroyed us."

"We, too, have the right to destroy you."

"Yes, everything."

"I have the right to take it."

I heard it from Antirrhinus.

What Sarkegaard said to Eleris in the moments leading up to the Gate incident.

Sarkegaard said.

Humanity destroyed the Darklands, so the Darklands have the right to destroy humanity.

The Gate debacle happened.

Eventually, those words will boomerang back to you.

Those destroyed, those taken, those murdered.

Since I am broken, I speak of the rights of the broken.

There are only a handful of people involved in this work.

The spirits in front of me now were on the sidelines for most of what was happening in the world.

They didn't decide anything, they didn't have an opinion.

They're just victims.

They were even killed by Riana's decision.

For them.

The right to destroy me.

Yes.

There will be. Obviously.

Other than them, who else has the right to destroy me, to hate me, to break me?

That thing is getting huge.

If left unchecked, it will get bigger and bigger, until it's too big for anyone to handle.

It will set me against those I love.

If its purpose is to cause me pain and suffering, it will do so.

"You must be scared of me."

I say to the lord of that grudge against me.

"You can't control me directly. You don't have the nerve to attack me directly. You don't have the nerve to kill me, so I guess you have no choice but to do it the cheesy way, by having me kill my own people with my own hands."

There was no answer, but I felt the stirrings of a great desire.

"What is your number, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions?"

"If that's all you have to show for your anger and vengeance against me. If that's all you have to show for it."

"Hate."

"Anger."

"Vengeful."

"It's not enough."

"Too much of the same, isn't it?"

Taunt.

"Weak beings."

"Because I was weak in life."

"I am weak even in death."

The only thing they have going for them is frustration.

Fundamentally, it will be in that weakness that they died because they were weak.

If they were strong, they wouldn't have died.

If only you were as strong as Ellen Artorius, warrior.

If they had the power.

He wouldn't have had to run, and he wouldn't have been killed.

I speak to such, to the spirits of the weak, to the masses.

I'm saying that this way of trying to inflict pain on me because you can't bring yourself to attack me is the way of the weak, and that you're weak even by being in a group like this.

The spirits didn't answer.

However, that wild squirming.

The menacing glint in his eye said it all.

The spirits are raging.

There is no such thing as overcoming yourself.

But.

I can't let those spirits get any bigger.

You can't put those desires into another being.

I don't want to fight the things I love.

You can no longer let others manipulate you.

"How strong is your resentment."

"If my spirit is strong."

"Let's try it."

If you hate me.

If they hate me, that's what I have to endure.

I can't make someone else carry the bridle I need to carry.

I don't think it's tolerable, but.

If it's something I have to live with.

If hatred, anger, and revenge are directed at me, whether it is deserved or not.

"Be in me."

I have to take their resentment and hatred and turn it on myself, not on others.

At my taunts, the spirits watch me.

"Why."

Toward them, you offer a final taunt.

"Are you afraid?"

I didn't need to say more.

In the body of the despairing mass, a vibration begins to rise.

-Currrrrr!

"Cursed be the devil."

"Yeah."

"We."

"Null."

"I curse you."

"With your own hands, I'll let you destroy everything you love."

A great darkness begins to condense like a cloud.

They changed their minds.

I'm not trying to get my loved ones to kill me, I'm trying to get my loved ones to kill me.

I spread my arms wide.

"Come, you weaklings."

I, for one, feel for the poor beings who had no choice but to be sacrificed.

It gives them a chance to destroy me.
