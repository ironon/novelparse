            Episode 422.





As I made my way through the gate and later via mass teleportation to my destination, the vicinity of Richie's tomb, I could see a large area of fog.

We weren't rushing in, we were just taking stock of the situation.

The Quantum Maze is not an impenetrable labyrinth. The Imperial Wizards might be, but most adventurers would have no choice but to turn back.

There's no telling where the Vampire Council and my helpers may or may not arrive.

We didn't enter the labyrinth, but stood on the periphery waiting for the wizards to finish their analysis.

Saviolin Tana relayed the cautionary tale to me and Harriet.

"Once inside, I will move with you in the center. Don't do anything I don't tell you to do, and if we get into a combat situation, stay out of harm's way as much as possible. Anyone who can defend you will be more than capable of doing so."

"Yes."

"Yes."

Both Harriet and I nodded nervously. It was natural for her to be nervous, not knowing what was inside.

I don't know if there really is a Lothar Dwyn in there. Hopefully he is, and we can capture at least one key member of Cantus Magna.

"We'll enter as soon as we're done analyzing the labyrinth."

Now that we were together, Tana seemed intent on going all out.

That's why we waited outside long after we arrived for the wizards to analyze it.

Nothing happened for a while, but that's what made my blood run dry.

Late at night.

The analysis wasn't over until the deep white full moon rose.

With the moon overhead, Harriet and I could only stand by and watch.

I wondered if this is what it's like to have a sweet tooth.

It wasn't until the full moon was tipping over that the wizards responded.

-Situation!

One of the mages analyzing the labyrinth called out to Tana.

-The fog is lifting!

"What?"

The labyrinth analysis isn't over.

An anomaly has been detected in the Labyrinth Zone.

It was literal.

We were on one side of this mountain range, watching over a huge fog zone, so we could see most, if not all, of the vastness of the labyrinth.

However, the fog was gradually clearing.

You know as well as I do that that fog is already functioning as a quantum maze in its own right.

But the fog is lifting.

This means that the Labyrinth is being unlocked.

Why?

Has someone broken through the labyrinth?

Or did someone turn off Quantum Maze altogether?

The answer was time.

-ddddddddddddddddddd!

"Ge....... earthquake?"

The earth trembles.

A mountain range where the fog has quickly dissipated.

I hugged Harriet, whose face was beginning to turn white.

-Currrrrr!

"Earthquake! Protect yourselves! There could be a landslide!"

Tana's frantic cries roused everyone to action.

Trees fell with a thunderous crash. The mages around us worked their magic. Harriet and I squinted, watching the ground in the center of the labyrinth rise unnaturally.

Bulge.

For a moment, the earth rises like a rubber balloon.

-Purrrrrrrrrr!

A powerful blue flash erupted from the depths of the underground, exploding the earth.

A blast of magic sweeps the world in all directions.

-Kwagga-Kwagga-Kang!

The powerful barrier that the Archmages around me and Tana had put up shielded us from the powerful shockwave.



* * *



The earth shudders.

I couldn't find a better way to say it.

After the ground around it exploded, the whole thing fell apart.

The ground nearby had given way and the ground was crumbling, turning the area into a giant ant-hole.

Luckily, everyone in the room was an Archmage, and they were able to keep themselves, as well as me and Harriet, safe from the blast.

The labyrinth is gone.

And the earth crumbled.

This means that those who wandered the labyrinth would have been blown to pieces in the explosion or buried in the vomit.

How many adventurers have sought treasure in that labyrinth? Hundreds? Thousands?

Unknown.

But there was no archmage to protect them, and they would have all died.

From our perch on the crumbling ground, we could see the center of the area, where even the fog had blown away.

It was so far away that Herriot wouldn't even be able to see it, and it would just look like a dot to me.

But one in-young is overcome by an ominous spirit.

-Bang! Kwah-rung! Quack!

It was clear that it was fighting something.

"All hands on deck, we're entering the field!"

Saviolin Tana exclaimed, gathering herself.

Whatever is going on over there, Saviolin Tana must take control of the scene. Herriot narrowed his eyes to see if she was using telescope magic.

"ah......."

Herriot's lip quivered as he pointed to the scene.

Harriet murmurs, dumbfounded, as if she's seen something she can't quite believe her eyes have seen.

"Dad......?"

"What?"

Herriot screamed, grabbing my arm.

"Oh, Daddy's there! Daddy's there!"

The Archduke of Saint-Thuan?

Why is the Archduke here?

No?

I felt my blood run cold, and of course I wasn't the only one who was stunned by the words.

"What do you mean, the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan is in there?"

"Yes! I don't know why, I don't know why, but I have a dad!"

Her lips were blue, and she was shaking.



* * *



-gooooooo

Akrich stood tall and glared at his surroundings as a powerful blast of magic blew the ground away.

The Labyrinth's original owner, Ritchie, was caught in the blast and disappeared.

Archduke Saint-Antoine and the Mages were unharmed.

Lucren, the Archon and head of Cantus Magna, turned his attention elsewhere before checking on Antrianus.

"Who the hell is she?

He didn't lift a finger during the explosion, not even a hair out of place.

He was still watching with a neutral expression on his face.

Who the heck is that.

Enemy or ally.

With no idea what she was, Lucren was most wary of this mysterious woman.

And in the moonlight, Lucren sensed that Antony's mood was slightly different.

A golden pupil with a vertical slit.

Pale skin and fangs protruding from between the lips.

The implications are clear.

"You've become a vampire, Antirrhinus."

"There are many ways to stand the test of time, you're a lich and I'm a vampire."

Both are the stuff of legend.

But it's bad.

Lukren looks up at the sky.

The time is night.

Vampires are creatures of the night.

"You should have organized your time better, Lucren."

The golden-eyed Antirrhinus raises both hands.

-Woody!

The Seven Families of the Great Lord Vampires.

Antirrhinus, lord of Saturday.

The earth rises, enveloping Akrich.

"Now, it's time to get to the truth of Akasha."

"What......?"

-Thump!

The mound of dirt that swallowed Lukren compacted and crystallized into rock in a matter of hours.

Antrianus smiled at the sight of Lucren, imprisoned in a prison of crystals.

"Ah."

Luna murmurs to herself.

"Is this a Saturday......."

The Archduke heard the low voice, but could not make out what it said.

"Maybe I'm not in the right place......."

Luna takes a step.

The next moment.

The Archduke watched as the woman suddenly disappeared.

Slowly, as before, I took a step.

But at that very moment, the Archduke saw the woman behind the old gentleman's back.

Whether it was magic or physical ability, the Archduke couldn't tell. With just one slow step, the woman caught up to the old gentleman.

"Is it you?"

Without turning around, the old gentleman opened his mouth with a faint smile.

"I'll ask."

Luna says still.

"Where are the archdemons?"

The question didn't faze Antirrhinus.

"How do you know such a story?"

"It doesn't matter."

As she took a step, she appeared in front of the old gentleman, not behind him.

The woman with her back to the moon asks Antirrhinus.

"Archdemon, where are you?"

Antony smiles at the question, his expression still calm.

"Hehe. I don't know which one you mean, but......."

The old vampire's eyes glint with amusement.

"An arm is something you bake inside......."

The old gentleman extends his hand to the woman.

"Who am I to speak of it to a stranger?"

-Whoosh!

Antirrhinus stretched out his hand and Luna disappeared like a mirage, only to reappear a few steps behind him.

"Also, you may be carefree, but I'm not."

-Twitter

A crack opened in the crystal prison behind Luna.

That wasn't all.

In the distance, Luna could see a group of mages and knights approaching.

"Hmm."

Literally, there was no time for idle chit-chat.

-Bam!

"Antirrhinus, you've become more of a trivializer."

After destroying the shattered crystal prison with his powers, Akrich spits out a hate-filled breath.

The fight between Akrich and the Lord Vampire.

Then an army of Swordmasters and Archmages approaches the scene.

Luna closed her eyes for a moment.

She took one step, and she was gone.

Antirrhinus looks at Akrich, who is roaring with rage, and smiles, not the fake smile he's used to, but a grotesquely twisted one.

"That's weird, Lucren."

Antirrhynchus watches as the imperial elite rush forward.

"Why did I come to this place alone?"

-pot!

One by one, the newcomers appear beside Antirrhinus.

Robed beings.

Support from the Black Order and the Vampire Council has arrived.

"Are you that confident?"

The imperial elite are coming.

It's going to be a mess, and someone is going to die.

The goal of the Vampire Council and the Black Order is to subdue Akrich and escape.

And the elite of the Empire were meant to be exterminated.

The Black Order and the Vampire Council.

Cantus Magna.

And the Imperial Elite.

The three-way battle was about to begin.

The leader of such an empire.

Saviolin Tana arrived on the scene of the confrontation.

"This is a pretty weird situation."

She stares at the group of robes and Akrich, and behind them, Archduke Saint-Thuan and the Mages.

"The Archduke is irrelevant.

Why he's here is unknown, but Tana figures it out as she watches the Archduke of Saint-Thuan pull back with his troops.

Superhuman, even beyond superhuman.

The world's strongest knight stares down at Akrich from his perch.

"Well, we'll just have to kill all the suspicious ones first."

Saviolin Tana points her Galeblade Tempesta at her enemies.

It doesn't matter to her how this happened.

You've come to destroy the enemies of the Empire, and you're here to do just that.



* * *



The elite of the Empire were charging into the center of the storm.

The fight had grown to a huge scale. Antirrhinus and a large group of men in robes appeared.

It was clear that the Black Order members had been joined by the Lord Vampire's clan.

Lucinil and the other patriarchs would have been involved in the situation.

The target would be Lothar Dwyn, but eventually the clash with the Imperial Elite would begin. The Empire wouldn't know who the enemy was, and while we'd like to keep as many people as possible out of harm's way, that would be impossible.

Someone is going to die.

Me and Harriet stayed back and watched the spectacle. It wasn't our place to intervene.

In the middle of that fight is Herriot's father, the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan.

Herriot does something in a situation he doesn't understand.

Then, in the distance, the Grand Duke of St. Thuan and his troops began to move toward us, away from the fighting.

While using short-range spatial movement in succession.

-Pow!

The Grand Duke of St. Thuan and his army approached, and the Grand Duke hauled Herriot roughly into his arms.

"Dad!"

-Wrong!

"Daughter, how did you get here......!"

He looked at me next to him and his eyes widened.

"Reinhardt, even you?"

I couldn't help but wonder if the Archduke of Saint-Thuan might be Cantus Magna.

-Kurrrrr! Kurrrr!

At the scene of the fight, where Antirrhinus was presumed to be, there was a fierce torrent of magic, lightning and thunder.

Add in Savior Tana's troops, and it was literally a whirlwind of a battle.

"Why is Daddy here? What is he doing here?"

Herriot said, trembling as he hugged the Archduke.

"Dangerous magic has been discovered, and I'm here to deal with it. But it seems there are more dangerous beings than I expected."

I don't know if what the Archduke said was true or not. But he seems to have changed his mind now that he's found Herriot here.

"I've got to get out of here, and we'll talk about this later."

"Yeah, yeah......."

As if to say, whatever I'm going to do, I'll do it after I make sure Herriot is safe, the Archduke released his embrace and looked around.

"Your Majesty, the mana flow is erratic. There are ultra-long-range spatial travel shields all over the place."

One of the Archduke's men reported that.

He had brought his elite forces here to capture Lothar Dwyn in the first place, so the Imperial Mages had analyzed the Labyrinth and even set up a spatial travel shield in this vast area.

It's not something that's easy to do, but the Imperial Mages can do the impossible.

"Then we'll use short-range spatial travel, daughter. Follow the troops. Reinhardt won't be able to use spatial travel, so I'll take him myself."

The idea seemed to be that the Archduke would send Herriot first and I would escort myself.

"No, we don't know what's going to happen. You go with Harriet, I'll catch up."

The Archduke seemed to be trying to protect me, but at this point, I was better off alone. I may need to contact Eleris and my forces in the coming days.

If the Empire succeeds in subduing Dwyn as a lothario, we may need to steal it.

"Is that okay?"

"Okay, go ahead."

The Archduke agreed to my suggestion, perhaps realizing that sending Herriot off on his own might cause problems, as well as my own safety.

"Reinhard....... Be careful......."

"Okay, you go first."

-nod

The group of mages, including Herriot and the Archduke, began to move away in short bursts of spatial travel.

I'll see what happens, but I'm not going to do that just yet.

I'm pretty sure that's Cantus Magna fighting over there. I wonder if the Archduke might not be in league with them, given that he abandoned that fight to come here.

Then why was the Archduke with that guy?

Is that really Lothar Dwin wreaking havoc over there?

What if the Empire kills him instead of subduing him?

That's when I turned to head up to higher ground to get a better view of the action.

For some time now, someone has been standing on the hill where the ground has collapsed.

"......."

A cold-faced woman stared down at me, her back to the moonlight.

The woman stood still, staring down at me.

I, for one, was not a stranger to her.

When Ellen grows up.

It was a woman who looked like a fantasy come true.

-Saman

She took a step, and she appeared in front of me as if she had leaped through space.

"!"

-char

A small pendant-like necklace, usually covered by a coppery case.

She took my necklace in her hand.

-Bam!

Then the case shattered, revealing the red jewel inside.

"Tuesday's Flame......."

She looks at me.

I recognized the flame as soon as I saw it.

"Where did you get this?"

The tone was friendly, but there was never a hint of favoritism in it.

"Nu, who....... Who, you."

She fixed her gaze on me, letting my necklace slip from her hand, and just stared at me.

"If you can't answer that, I'll have to ask you another question."

I felt a suffocating pressure, even though nothing was happening to me.

"Where are the archdemons?"

With that, she takes a step, a backward step.

-Kwachang!

And a blue magic spear appeared where she had been.

-pot!

And then someone else's new car arrived on my doorstep.

"Elise!"

"Get back, degradation!"

Eleris hadn't gotten into the fight, but had been scanning the area.

Elise, who had been watching the situation, intervened when she realized I was in danger.

The dark-haired woman looks at Eleris.

"You're here, Gajuiza, lord of the seven nights......."

"......."

"Ancient Archdemon."

The words seemed to stop me in my tracks.

"And, the boy who isn't a vampire, but has a flame of fire......."

She looks at me.

"A boy protected by an archdemon......."

I don't know what this person is talking about.

But the fact that I had a flame of fire seemed to draw a conclusion, as if it was already a given.

"Pilsi, you are the last Archdemon."

Neither Elise nor I knew who the woman in front of us was, but she instantly knew who we were as soon as she saw us.

"Who art thou?"

Elise looks at the woman, her expression filled with hostility.

I still don't even understand what she said when she looked at Eleris.

"Luna."

She takes a few steps back and stares at Eleris.

"日月當主, Luna artorius."

She held her right arm still.

At that moment, something unbelievable happened.

"It was originally the party's law not to interfere in the affairs of the people......."

As if the laws of the world had been reversed, the full moon behind her suddenly grew enormous.





The full moon, now ten or twenty times larger than usual, bathed the world in a chilling light.

I didn't understand a single thing that was going on.

"I don't want to lose a child twice."

She reaches out to the enlarged moon. There was something in her hand, as if swallowed by the moonlight.

In her hand, she held the Divine Waldo, which was shaped as if it held moonlight.

What is an ancient archdemon, and what does it mean to be a moonbat?

I don't know.

But the results are in front of you.

Ellen's mother is trying to kill me.
