The sword is broken.

But neither I nor Ludwig was fazed. As if he knew it, Ludwig tried to strike me in the head with the pommel of his broken sword.

"Suck!"

Enchantment.

Answer.

I let go of his head and drove my fist into Ludwig's abdomen.

-Bam!

-Puck!

"Poof!"

"Suck!"

Ludwig rolled several times across the floor before getting to his feet, the blow to the stomach terrifying. Their arms were broken. No time to reload.

I threw the broken sword away, and so did Ludwig.

Ludwig pounces, and the longer I hold on to the enchantment, the harder the next set becomes, so I have to finish quickly.

Ludwig, who has fallen, is scrambling to his feet, looking for a ground-and-pound.

Pounding after a tackle.

That's what we're aiming for for now.

-Thump!

Ludwig fell on top of me, crashing to the ground.

At this point, it's already over.

A moment of reflection.

The moment he fell, he grabbed me around the waist and flipped me over.

Enchantments provide protection, but do not add weight per se.

-Thump!

In an instant, I lost my balance and flew backwards.

Crazy.

The subject hasn't even been disenchanted, and his power is already out of the realm of normal.

That's a monster bigger than me.

Me, the unsteady hand.

Ludwig may lack physicality, but he makes up for it in staying power.

I don't know what the hell happened to his body, but I can't fight him without magnetic suggestion and magical enhancements.

I win.

I never thought I'd be in a position to rival it, but it shouldn't be any easier than it already is.

Just as in the original, Ellen's mere existence spurred Ludwig's growth.

I am also a growth engine that makes Ludwig stronger just by existing.

I even stir up Ludwig's tenuous sense of jealousy and inferiority because I started at the bottom.

The stronger I get, the faster Ludwig gets stronger.

I, for one, will not lose to you.

You will only be stronger if I am always a wall above you.

The protagonist must be strong.

One day you will be stronger than me, but for now I must be stronger than you.

That's what a rival is.

So, you can't lose.

I'm finally getting serious with the guy I created but always avoided because he was a subtle asshole.

He sees me as a serious rival, and I can't help but agree.

The last one standing is the winner.

You, for now, must lose to me.

I will concede the final victory, and you must continue to lose to me.

To do this, I don't think I can lose, but at the same time, I believe I can't lose.

"You, you can't beat me."

Declare that you will never lose.

"Suck!"

I lunge at Ludwig and throw a punch, but he dodges my outstretched arm with a shake of his head and grabs me by the arm to take me to the ground.

However, as I ran into the force of his pull, I brought my knee up to meet Ludwig's chin.

-Bam!

"Boom!"

Ludwig takes a solid knee to the jaw and stumbles backwards.

Ludwig rolled around a few times before waking up.

I looked at Ludwig's gums to see if he was okay, and saw a trickle of blood.

He doesn't even look sick. You have to give him credit for grit. Of course, it's only in situations like this that pain is felt less.

You can't lose.

The unexpected variables of this tournament, which I entered for achievement points, changed my purpose.

Scarlett and Ludwig, who were merely competitors, meant me in different ways.

I didn't think I had much of a connection, but as a result of my actions up to this point, these guys were seeing me in different ways, but ultimately similarly.

Scarlett was idolizing me.

Ludwig wanted to catch up with me, but he felt like I was a wall he could never reach.

So, I'll give you a landslide victory.

For the sake of the growth of this weirdo who wants to climb every wall he can't climb, I have to.

So, let me show you.

Ludwig rushes toward me, his lips bitten off and bloodied.

You've shaped this world so that it's on your side, but I have more.

Self-implied.

Words.

Enchantment.

And the feeling.

And a training partner named Ellen.

Under all conditions, Ludwig can't keep up with me.

So, trample it.

In this moment, your greatest weapon is not an enchantment, nor is it a superpower, it's your instincts.

Read it out loud.

To lunge is to take an action that causes your center of gravity to shift forward.

Timing is everything.

If you can read what step they're going to attack and how they're going to come in, you can put a counter in.

While it's important to know which foot you're powering through, it's even more important to look at your shoulders. You can predict the movement of the arm by looking at the shoulder. Someone skilled in martial arts might be able to throw a punch without moving their shoulders, but neither Ludwig nor I are at that level.

If the waist is moving instead of the arms, we can assume that the attacker is going to use their feet.

Moving with a sword is no different in the end. Every action has a starting point, and it must come from the body.

Ludwig's right shoulder falls back as he runs.

The right shoulder pulls back slightly, which means the right arm is about to reach out to me.

If so, you're trying to use your left foot as an axis and your right fist in my face.

It seemed too accurate.

There are many ways to do this.

Ludwig can either slip his right fist out and use his left fist to punch deep into his face, or he can use the thrust of his incoming right arm as a weapon.

The moment you read what's coming, the game is already won or lost.

I neither deflected nor returned the attack.

Before Ludwig can even get into an attacking stance with his left foot.

I take a step, or rather a poke, forward.

We know that as soon as Ludwig's left foot hits the ground, he will move his right shoulder on the axis of his left foot.

I poked the point one timing ahead.

The moment just before the attack begins.

-Bam!

I kicked the crap out of him just before his left foot touched the floor.

"Boom!"

As a result, it looked like he was lunging to kick me.

It's even more damaging because it happened when you weren't prepared for it.

Ludwig didn't get up this time as he sprawled across the floor. It was a perfect counter, with the power of magic and self-reinforcement.

It's weird to wake up.

-First set! Mr. Ludwig has been declared incapacitated, so Mr. Reinhardt takes the match!

Ludwig didn't even wake up.

"ugh......."

As the priests rushed to his aid, Ludwig collapsed and looked up at me.

It was like looking at an inscrutable being.

In fact, I only had to see Ludwig lunge to take him down with a single, precise blow.

It reads perfectly. No matter what I do in the future, it will eventually read.

How the hell am I supposed to beat an opponent like that?

He had a pensive look on his face.

My trait of clairvoyance was giving me too much efficiency. Partly, I suppose, because it's the power I've been given in exchange for the most dangerous thing I've ever done.

I was smiling.

"I told you you couldn't win."

"......."

Not yet.

I swallowed that afterthought.

I felt like a villain.

No, he's actually the villain. Because I'm the Devil, and Ludwig is the second hero of humanity after Lagan Artorius.

A warrior who is always defeated by demons.

But maybe one day we'll catch up with the devil and do justice.

The overly perfect picture seemed to foreshadow my eventual downfall.

After being healed by the priests, Ludwig stands up.

"Let's try again. Reinhardt."

Ludwig wonders if it's a good idea to have such an inscrutable opponent as a rival, but he doesn't give up.

"It won't be much different."

"Still, you never know until you try."

He'll fall again and again, but he'll get back up.

You're not going to give up, you're going to keep bumping up against it.

I've always been the egg that breaks the rock, but this guy is the one that throws the egg until the rock breaks.

I don't consider myself superior to Ludwig.

Someone who has never been broken, someone who has been broken hundreds or thousands of times and still gets back up.

Ludwig will be greater than the likes of me.

However, greatness doesn't buy you victories.

Right now, I'm stronger, and Ludwig can't cross the gap.

-Set score is 1:0! Reinhardt has taken the first set! Okay, second set of the first grade tournament final, starting now!

-Waaaaaah!

Amidst a roar that I had become accustomed to after only two days, Ludwig and I were issued replenished armor.

This time, a sword.

What's the difference between a fist and a sword?

In this first-year tournament, which was already full of upsets, there were no more.

I took a commanding victory in two straight sets.

And so, I won.



* * *



I'm technically outclassed by most close combat majors, but I'm outclassed by Ludwig.

So no matter how much his physicals rise, I'm still ahead of him with the enchantment, and his moves are too easy to read.

This is a fight where it didn't make sense for me to lose even one set. Ludwig's only chance of victory was if I overdid the enchantments and burned out, and that didn't happen.

My victory in the final clinched first and second place, followed by a third and fourth place match between Scarlett and Glayden Amorel.

The result was a victory for Gladen Amorelle.

And just like that, the first-year tournament is over.

I never thought I'd get to hold a trophy in my hands like this.



[Achievement - Win the First Grade Tournament].

[Earned 10,000 achievement points].



I've never scored so much in one go.

People have been cheering me on.

"Do you think I can keep up with you?"

There was no despair in Ludwig's defeated expression, but he seemed to sense the doubt.

"You know what I'm going to say, right?"

"......Yes."

Ludwig smiles at me.

"I'm supposed to believe I can catch up, right?"

"No."

I crossed my arms, holding my trophy.

"It's not a matter of believing, it's a matter of thinking."

"Oh, right. You did, didn't you?"

Uh oh.

Looks like the main character has been inducted into my school of self-suggestion, says Ludwig, winner of the 2nd place trophy.

"I can keep up with you, Reinhardt."

"What do you mean no way?"

It's a strange religion, where you want me to believe that your version of the future is true, but I don't agree with it.

Believe in your own future.

In the end, I and Ludwig had similar powers, albeit different ones.

I did run into some weird stuff while trying to earn achievement points, but my plan didn't deviate too much.

I won.

That day, Ellen was watching from afar.

He said he'd punish me if I didn't win.

Because you won.

Do you want a pat on the back?
