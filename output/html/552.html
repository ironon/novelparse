            Episode 552.





The Imperial Mausoleum is located inside the Imperial Castle.

Infiltrating the Imperial City is almost identical in difficulty to infiltrating the Temple.

Of course, it's harder to infiltrate the Yellow Star now that the temple is nearly empty, but the conditions for getting in are the same.

There has to be something about authorization, and there can't be unauthorized entry.

Obviously, you can't use magic to enter, including teleportation.

The warp gate in the Palace of Spring does not have a starter artifact, and even if it did, the gate is already broken and you cannot enter through it.

Sarkhegar was able to turn into a bird and fly in and out of the temple, but I can't turn into a bird. Technically, I can transform, but I can't flap my wings.

Even if it did, it would be useless for me to go in alone. I can wield the corruptive power of Tiamata, but I can't wield it as freely as Olivia can.

Charlotte laid out a number of ways we could break into the city, but all of them involved significant risk or were far from perfect.

It's even weirder if Charlotte knows how to break into the imperial castle in the first place.

Most of the Empire's elite, including Shanapelle, are away.

If you somehow managed to infiltrate the imperial city, you might be able to sneak away or escape if you were discovered.

It's bad enough if the story of the demon's reappearance spreads across the zodiac, but it's worse if it reaches the Alliance.

People are afraid of me.

While breaking down the gate, the mere thought of the Yellow City falling to a demonic assault sends the Allies into a panic.

Anyway, I'm here to do something bold, and I'm hoping to make as little noise as possible.

Well, it's not up to me to infiltrate the Imperial Palace, but.......

We're not going to get into that just yet.

So let's start with the National Cemetery, which is a little safer than the Yellow Castle, nestled in the rolling hills of the northern ecliptic.

It's an honored place to be for those who have done great things.

Heroes aren't the only ones who enter the Imperial Mausoleum.

"That's huge."

We were standing in a field with the national cemetery in the distance, one of many roads in the northern part of the ecliptic.

It's more like a park than a cemetery. Not surprising, given the large scale of the site.

It has survived despite being outside the ecliptic because it is not worth destroying for the monsters.

Because monsters aren't interested in corpses.

"There's someone coming in and out unexpectedly."

"It's bound to happen."

There were troops at the massive entrance, and quite a few people coming and going.

It could be the bereaved. It could be those who came to comfort the fallen.

No matter how busy life is, there are bound to be condolences. In fact, in times like these, there may be more than usual.

Those who honor, remember, and grieve the death of someone.

We came to take the bodies from them.

Anyone can give a condolence, anyone can be there.

There is a history and there are gatekeepers, but you don't need a special status to get in.

That's why we were able to walk into the national cemetery uninhibited. Just like everyone else walks in and out of national cemeteries without being stopped.

It's more like a giant park than a cemetery.

The imperial mausoleum is obviously reserved for royalty, and this one is open to civilians.

I also wonder what the point of having a national cemetery so close to a giant park is for people who don't have much to live for.

It's a good thing the foundation of the ecliptic hasn't crumbled to the point of open theft.

Because it was a space, everyone who came and went was calm, regardless of color.

Upon entering, there were no rows of graves, but rather an outline with several spaces marked for memorialization.

Olivia crosses her arms, looking at the map.

"It's compartmentalized. It looks like the cemetery has expanded to the east, and it looks like it's for the dead."

Different merits have different areas you can enter.

Some are buried in open-air cemeteries, while others are thought to have temples and catacombs for those of great merit.

"The first stop would be the graveyard of the fallen, and the second would be the catacombs in the center."

I guess we're weird people if we don't get punished.......

People are walking around mourning, looking depressed, and we're thinking about stealing.

No, it's worse than stealing.

"There are quite a few people, and the day is still light. We'll wait until nightfall to act."

It's still broad daylight, although a lot of time has passed since we arrived at the ecliptic.

"I've got time to kill, let's go over there."

Olivia scratched her head as she looked at where I pointed, and so did Harriet.

The place I pointed to in the outline is not a different place.

Lead-free cemeteries.

My heart is heavy just looking at it, but Charlotte told me.

"...... should be there.

EpinHauser.

And Loyar.

I was told that their graves are here.



* * *



The day the gates opened.

Effinghauser and Loyard and Roussinil and Sarkegard came to my rescue.

Effinghauser and Loyard are dead, Roussinil and Sarkegard are captured.

Their bodies would not have been laid to rest in this national cemetery in the first place.

We don't know how he managed it, but somehow he was buried in the National Cemetery's unmarked gravesite.

Both are traitors to humanity for siding with the Devil, so they can't have tombs with their names on them.

The fact that they were laid to rest in a national cemetery, albeit an unrelated one, was a sign of the Gradias Empire's regret and apology.

That doesn't bring you back from the dead, though.

Olivia and Harriet know that Dr. Effinghauser died fighting to save me, and they know about Loyaar's existence.

Effinghauser and Loyard, whose identities are known, but who cannot have tombstones with their names on them, become the owners of an unmarked graveyard.

"......."

The nameless tombstones were spread out around the memorial tower.

I don't know which of these many tombstones belong to Loyard and which to Effinghauser.

Neither Harriet nor Olivia seemed to budge.

I'm afraid of what's going to come out of my mouth.

Fearful imaginings.

We have a job to do, so we can't help but think in terms of that.

They think I might try to resurrect Loyard and Effinghauser as Death Knights.

"Reinhardt....... Probably won't have a consciousness or a self when he returns......."

"......."

"Being a Death Knight while alive is not the same as raising the dead."

Eppinhauser, the Swordmaster.

Loyard, who was supposedly even better than that.

Obviously, it would help to make it Death Knight.

But that's probably not all there is to it.

"Why would I do that?"

Call me selfish, but I can't help it.

"I don't want to turn anyone I know into that."

I am here to make supplies for war.

And I'm not about to do something horrible like take people who are important to me with me.

That doesn't make it any less awful to build something like that as a stranger.

No, it's more horribly selfish to think that it's okay to make someone you care about, but not someone else.

It's a terrible thought, but consumables need to be made into something that can be treated as consumable. And these are the ones I don't consider expendable.

They were sacrificed for me.

Let's give them a break.

Calling them back does not inhabit their souls. No, it would be a terrible thing to do.

I can't really say how much of a difference it is to capitalize on the deaths of people who didn't matter to me versus those who did.

But I guess we can't help but play favorites.

What would Loyard have wanted?

Sometimes it seemed like they wanted to rebuild the world, sometimes they didn't.

He didn't seem very loyal to me, but in the end, he was as loyal as Sarkegar.

Everyone in the Rotary Club is dead, too.

After losing everything, Loyar died to protect me, the last person left standing.

I don't know much about Loyar.

This is especially true at EpinHauser.

"I'm still not sure."

"What......?"

"Why Dr. Effinghauser died trying to save me."

My cooperation with Dr. Effinghauser's plan to save me had nothing to do with the Black Order.

In fact, most of the Order's remaining core forces have been wiped out in their attempts to kill me. The remnants that escaped are probably not worth bothering with, so the Black Order is effectively dead.

EpinHauser believed in me.

I don't know what it believed, but it believed in me, so I tried to save it.

"Back in the day, do you remember when I fought those Orbis class guys?"

"Yes......."

Rilka Aaron, and her fight with Oscar de Gradias.

This led to the closure of the Orbis class.

"In the disciplinary committee, Mr. Effinghauser said that."

"What do you mean?"

"They say I'm the most brilliant person in the history of Temple."

I thought he was just lying to protect me.

How could I be called that when Ellen was there, I asked after the disciplinary committee was over, and Effinghauser said with a straight face that he really thought so.

"I know what I'm capable of, and no matter how much I think about it, I don't think I'm that good. So it was kind of embarrassing."

What did Effinghauser see in me?

"But now that I think about it, I can't say that Dr. Epinhauser was wrong."

Neither Harriet nor Olivia had a response to my question.

I don't know if it's comparable to Ellen or not.

At this point, I'm probably one of the few people who can stand up to Ellen.

If I could beat Ellen, then Effinghauser would be right.

I don't know why it died to protect me, or what it saw in me.

I have no intention of bringing him back with Deathknight, and even if I did, he wouldn't be able to talk to me, so I'll never know.

I liked Mr. Effinghauser from the start, who was blunt and uninterested in his students, rather than the sweet and affectionate Mr. Mustang of Class B.

But I was wrong.

Effinghauser was not a teacher who didn't care about his students.

I still don't know EpinHauser.

"Let's go."

However, I think he knew me.
