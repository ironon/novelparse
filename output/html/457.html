Very few countries were intact.

"We have word, Your Majesty, that the Special Forces, led by Ellen Artorius, have succeeded in reclaiming the Lambator Principality."

"......Yes. That's good."

From his throne in the Realm of Reality, Bertus nodded slowly as he stroked his scepter.

Last month, Imperial Emperor Neliod de Gradias passed away.

The Ancestral Emperor survived the Great Demon War, but after the events of the Gate, his strength began to decline and he eventually died.

The responsibility, guilt, and gravity of the situation ultimately killed the emperor.

Bertus de Gradias inherited the throne without even a proper coronation.

The emperor's position was taken in a way that Bertus never wanted.

The twilight of humanity.

In a moment that can only be characterized as such, Bertus was fighting a war for the fate of humanity.

Mindless monsters rampage across the continent, driven only to kill humans.

No negotiations, no diplomacy.

It was a war whose sole purpose was the annihilation of the other.

And everyone had some responsibility in all of this.

The devil himself.

The Demon King's men, who activated Akasha to save the Demon King.

An empire that didn't believe the devil.

But the details didn't spread, and most people only knew at face value that it was caused by the devil.

Only the Popes of the Five Great Houses, the Grand Master of the Crusade Knights, and a few members of the Imperial Family, including Ellen, knew of these events.

After Gate, things were looking bleak, but not without progress.

"Your Majesty, the 1st Commando of Shanafel, led by Sir Saviolin Tana, has succeeded in propagating the Warp Gate of Hashfell, capital of the Kingdom of Haig."

"......Good."

While Ellen Artorius and her squad were tasked with killing all the monsters in the ruined city, Saviolin Tana had the even more dangerous task of getting there before them, destroying all the warp gates that spewed them out, and then fleeing the area.

If Ellen moves to repair the region, Savior Tana works to repair the region.

Both were on a very dangerous mission.

Their roles were crucial now.

Saviolin Tana as the undisputed strongest human being. Ellen Artorius is the savior of mankind with two holy relics.

In a world where Olivia Ranze and the Devil have disappeared with the holy relics, she is the hope of humanity.

More than just talented, they were two powerful crutches for a desperate humanity.

The belief that Ellen Artorius will save humanity.

Of the Five Great Lords, Tuan and Als chose the Demon and those who disappeared with him.

Thus, the martial religion of Ellen Artorius as a prophet had already begun to encroach on folk beliefs, with unsavory results.

The power of the Empire declined, and many empires collapsed.

Even the countries that have managed to hold on have barely managed to hold on to their capitals and a few key cities.

You must destroy all the warp gates on the continent and slay the otherworldly monsters scattered across the land.

The rebuilding of humanity begins after that.

But will that day ever come?

'Reinhard.......'

Bertus gritted his teeth.

'Yeah, I was wrong. I was wrong about everything, one through ten.

I didn't believe it because I couldn't believe it.

In return, I was forced to stand at the crossroads of humanity's downfall and rebuilding every moment.

The Imperial Zodiacal Gradient was filled with shantytowns teeming with refugees from vast regions.

We couldn't leave the people who had been rescued from the monster's clutches alone, so we had to bring them back to the imperial capital.

They had to survive somehow in this part of the ecliptic.

Relief supplies are scarce, and there is no bread to give them, which inevitably leads to criminal activity.

The shantytowns outside the boundaries of the ecliptic were, therefore, a vast frontier.

You never know when they might suddenly turn into a mob and storm the palace.

Where is the legitimacy of an empire when a mob of helpless subjects descends upon the palace, and what can you do but kill them all?

In the two years since the gate incident, the size of the ecliptic gradient has more than tripled since the refugees arrived.

It was not uncommon for monsters from the far reaches of the ecliptic to wander the land after exiting the gates and raid the outer reaches of the ecliptic.

And that wasn't the only problem.

The refugees in the shantytowns are refugees who have found their way to the ecliptic in one way or another, and most of them have been helped by the Empire.

Soon, there were quite a few people who had experienced Ellen Artorius' greatness firsthand.

After Ellen slashed through hundreds of monsters, many were rescued.

As such, most of the refugees were believers in Shintoism.

"The persecution of believers in Tuan and Als is....... is crossing the line."

"......Yes."

Tiamata and Alsbringer chose the Demon.

As such, while the Warrior Cultists don't like the other Five Great Houses of God, Tuan and Als are practically demonic religions.

It was not uncommon for followers of both denominations to be stoned to death, and for Tuan priests sent to treat the wounded to be verbally abused.

An insubstantial faith was becoming increasingly entrenched in the folklore of the powerful Ellen Artorius.

And other issues, such as the warrior faith.

"Your Majesty....... I am honored by your words......."

Bertus narrowed his eyes, as if he knew what he was talking about.

"Another round of protests to get Charlotte out?"

"......Yes."

The enraged Championists wanted a scapegoat.

Charlotte de Gradias is clearly cursed by the Devil.

The Heroic Cultists had already gone beyond the rumor that Charlotte was cursed by the Devil and were screaming that she was probably a collaborator of the Devil and should be killed.

The protests calling for the empress to be killed had already gained the support of a large crowd.

It's no good saying that killing the Empress won't change anything.

The most important enemy is the Devil.

But the devil is nowhere to be found in the world, so people want a scapegoat.

People were shouting that Charlotte de Gradias, the Devil's collaborator, should be killed.

However, there is only one reason why the followers of the Dragonlord religion have not gone beyond protesting.

This is because Charlotte's guardian knight is Ellen Artorius, the savior of the humanity they worship.

The more Ellen is involved, the more her beliefs are reinforced, putting Charlotte's life in danger.

But that's exactly what was happening, with Ellen's fame becoming a shield for Charlotte.



* * *



After completing his morning duties, Bertus visited the Palace of Spring.

Entering the sparsely populated but heavily guarded Palace of Spring, Bertus headed straight for Charlotte's bedroom.

In the bedroom was his brother, Charlotte de Gradias, sitting in the dark.

Charlotte had been in that state for some time and hadn't been able to get back to normal.

"Brother."

"......."

Charlotte cocked her head and looked at Bertus.

Charlotte, with her black hair and red devil eyes, was not allowed to go outside.

To anyone who saw her, even Bertus, who was trying to protect her, it was clear that Charlotte's form was cursed by the devil.

Even worse, Bertus realizes that it's actually a fusion of the demon and Charlotte's soul.

She's not cursed by the devil, she's possessed by the devil's spirit.

The crowd would be even more rabid if the truth were told.

If you put a demonized Charlotte in front of an unspecified number of people and tell them that the Empress is actually innocent of any wrongdoing, who will believe you?

Who would believe the Empress, who embodied ominousness itself?

"Have you eaten?"

At Bertus's question, Charlotte shook her head.

Bertus pulled up a chair and sat down at Charlotte's bedside.

After the events of the Gate, monsters also appeared from the Gate hidden in the basement of the Palace of Spring.

Charlotte used her powers to defeat the monster and destroy the gate.

But after the dust settled, Bertus explained everything to Charlotte.

Apparently, the demon was really trying to stop this.

While it's clear that the devil's minions caused this, Reinhardt doesn't think he really wanted it to happen.

A desperate brother who had been used by the devil from start to finish, wondering if he could ever get back on track in this bizarre form.

I'm not being taken advantage of.

It's hard to believe, but Reinhardt really cared about people, and he seemed to care about you.

He wondered if that would help Charlotte.

But as it turns out, it was the biggest mistake of all.

As if they regret some of the things they've said.

Unable to breathe, Charlotte fevered and lost consciousness.

Afterward, upon awakening, Charlotte began to act as if she had lost most of her speech.

For the sins of speech, I've stopped saying anything but the bare minimum.

However, Charlotte was locked in her bedroom at the Palace of Spring and couldn't or wouldn't come out on her own.

Bertus had a hunch that Charlotte was driven by remorse for the many curses she had spoken to the demon, for the many times she had felt betrayed by him.

You've been used by a demon.

So he cursed the man who had saved him so many times to die the most miserable death in the world.

Like Ellen, there were many who felt it was their responsibility, and Charlotte was one of them.

Charlotte was in shock and guilt.

In the form of a cursed horror, he is unable to help anyone, or even take a step outside of the Palace of Spring.

So Charlotte was slowly sinking into darkness where spring should have been.

The crowd wants Charlotte dead.

As his hatred of the Devil grows, so does his hatred of Charlotte.

If there's a critical mass of people who say we can't kill the devil, so we'll kill Charlotte instead, then Charlotte may indeed be the scapegoat.

Bertus held still, squeezing Charlotte's shrunken hand.

It was slender.

"Brother......."

"......."

It was a competitor I hated to kill, but at some point I felt sorry for him and couldn't hate him anymore.

Two years after Gate.

Now Bertus wanted to protect Charlotte at all costs.

But.

One day, Bertus may have to hand Charlotte over to the crowd himself.

Now you may be forced to make the decision to kill Charlotte with your own hands, even though you don't want to.

Charlotte and the Empire.

Weighing the two on a scale, Bertus is forced to choose the Empire.

Because emperors are supposed to.

"I'm having a hard time with....... It's hard......."

With those words, Bertus walked away.

After Bertus left, Charlotte stood still, staring out the window of the Palace of Spring.

Even if the world ends.

Even if humanity's fortunes were on the line.

Even when a dark cloud hangs over your mind, and the darkness threatens to consume you.

The sun was shining.

While Ellen is taking on the monsters as humanity's hope, the other students at Temple are also in the fray, each with their own mission.

-Kyaaah!

"Hmph!"

As the three-headed snake slithered across the floor in front of him, Ludwig dodged the attack with a fluid motion and swung his sword at the snake's head.

-skuck!

Enveloped in a fiery blue aura, Ludwig struck down one snake's head, and when another tried to bite his arm, he gave it away.

-Bam!

Rather, Ludwig stuck his hand into the snake's gullet and, with a hand burning with blue magic, yanked out the snake's tongue, while simultaneously cutting off the other's head.

-Thump!

The three-headed snake's body began to wriggle on the ground, and Ludwig stepped back in a cold sweat.

"Whoa....... Whoa......."

"Ludwig! Up!"

"Huh?"

Once the giant snake was dealt with, a giant flying creature began its descent, sharp claws outstretched to snatch Ludwig from the sky.

But before the creature's claws could reach Ludwig, flames struck the creature's head.

-Quack!

The impact of the explosion sent the behemoth reeling, and it slammed into the ground to Ludwig's right.

"Hmph!"

Ludwig immediately plunged his sword into the flying creature's head, and it soon stopped struggling.

"Woohoo....... Thanks, Delphine."

"Careful, you keep forgetting there's more than one monster."

"It should be......."

Ludwig looked around, brushing the blood and oil from his sword.

Temple's students were also being sent into combat, though not on missions as dangerous as Ellen's.

"But spirits, that's really interesting."

Ludwig said as he looked at the strange creatures, neither ghosts nor monsters, floating beside Delphine Izadra.

"Because whatever helps in this situation."

The flying creature that had just struck was a bird-like spirit with flames floating to Delphine's right.

During the fight against the Gate, Delphine Isadra, naturally gifted in archery, took to the field with a bow.

But in a moment of crisis, when Ludwig was about to lose his life to the monster, Delphine summoned a spirit to protect him from the attack.

Neither Delphine nor the Empire knows what a spirit is.

I could only assume it was some kind of unexplained power, akin to a superpower.

Delphine doesn't know why the spirits are helping her.

The Empire was interested in Elementalism, but there was no such thing as time to study it.

Delphine Isadra, the only elementalist in the world, summoned the spirits of wind, fire, and thunder to fight.

'Reinhard.......'

Ludwig heads to the next fight, sword in hand.

Ludwig gritted his teeth as he stepped over shattered buildings and the bodies of dead soldiers.

"One day, I'm going to make you pay for all of this.

The controlled truth is that more people still don't know.

That's why the world is full of devil-haters.

Over the horizon, masts begin to rise one by one.

"How many people were there last time you saw them?"

"Probably....... eight hundred?"

Herriot paused for a moment before answering my question.

Fighting monsters and rescuing civilians on the continent.

Refugees are escorted to Port Mokna, the port connecting the continent to the Edina Archipelago, where they are loaded onto boats and sent to the Edina Archipelago.

My troops on the continent were still rescuing displaced vagabonds and refugees, putting them on ships and sending them to the Edina Archipelago.

The Empire does not know that I have established a stronghold in the Edina Archipelago.

Port Mokna isn't that important, and the Empire has other places to worry about.

"You should have explained it better. I'm tired of seeing them freak out and jump in the water as soon as they get off the boat."

"I'm sure you did a good job."

"I hope so."

The Edina Archipelago is no ordinary place.

First, I, the leader, am the devil.

And some of those on the streets are demons.

From demons such as orcs and goblins to succubi, there were definitely ogres living on the Edina Archipelago, though not many of the larger species.

I'm tired of hearing people screaming that they've been rescued by mysterious people, followed a long sea path, and are about to be eaten by demons.

The good news is that the people of the archipelago have gotten used to the demons coming and going as they please.

Of course, I still see the occasional child peeing at the sight of an orc or ogre.

Fortunately, without any visible clashes, the demons and humans were getting along without too much trouble, if not completely merging.

It wasn't without its frustrations and fears.

However, that complaint was quickly put to rest when the refugees arrived and rumors of a continent gone to hell spread.

Because everyone knows that the only way to defy my rule and flee to the continent is death.

I was standing on the dock in Razak with Harriet. I was at the front of the line, and there were tons of people waiting to escort people from the refugee ships that were about to dock.

It had always been a large port city, but the size of the harbor was much larger than before, as large fleets of ships carrying refugees rather than trade goods were arriving and departing.

-sigh

As we waited to enter the harbor, Harriet and I could see one of the inyongs approaching us as we swam through the clear waters.

"Oh, there......."

"Uh."

Soon, the thing that was so close to my nose emerged from the water with only the top half of its body.

"Your Majesty, I've prepared the provisions you spoke of on the western shore, and they'll soon wash up on the current."

A being with the upper half of a human and the lower half of a fish.

It was Mermaid, or mermaids.

"Yeah, I'll put people on hold there, it's always a pain."

"No, we are honored to serve your majesty."

As sea-dwelling demons, mermaids could not be minions of the devil.

But for now, the beach is my home base.

The mermaids, who weren't exactly hostile to humans, became my allies in a way that scared me to death.

With food always in short supply, they were tasked with gathering marine food resources.

Their efficiency is unparalleled by fishermen, and they are in fact responsible for much of the food situation in the Edina Archipelago, especially in Rajak.

The red-haired mermaid, in the form of a woman, soon dives headfirst into the ocean and glides through the water, disappearing. Harriet watched in disbelief as the mermaid glided through the water.

"Mermaids are....... I think they're really pretty."

True to Herriot's words, mermaids are more beautiful creatures than I ever imagined. I didn't even know they existed.

Of course, she always showed up naked with her upper body completely uncovered, so I had to nag her for quite a while to put on some seaweed when we met.

He just showed up with a kelp-like thing across his chest.

As for the demons, well, aside from their ability to dominate, they're dead, if you ask me. The mere sight of my face thrills them.

So the demons were unconditionally on my side.

Anyway.

It's true that mermaids are pretty.

"I suppose so."

"......."

At my words, Harriet stares at me.

Uh, what?

Angry?

"Oh, no, what....... You said it first......!"

"Well. Idiot."

A fleet of ships approaches on the horizon.

The Edina Archipelago is a place where distance from the continent is usually a fatal disadvantage, but in this case, it could serve as a refuge for all those affected by the Gate.

One by one, the ships pulled in, and one by one, the evacuees disembarked, led by the soldiers.

Fortunately, the captain and crew had done a good job of explaining, and while the evacuees seemed to be frightened by the demonic landscape, they didn't scream or try to run away.

They've seen hell on the continent. They have nowhere else to go, and they have been wandering aimlessly, fleeing monsters.

Not knowing when they will die, their only option is to live among the demons.

Evacuees have been living in temporary shelters for some time.

The succubi were lined up at the entrance to the huge temporary shelter where they would arrive.

All of them had regrown all of their horns and were much more numerous.

By my word, all the severed horns of the succubus that should not have grown back grew.

Some of the succubi stayed by Airi's side, but many returned to the Darklands.

I brought the succubi back to Darkland.

Succubi with regrown horns.

Frightened by the demons, but mesmerized by their appearance, the refugees stare at the succubi in a daze.

It was the same for Herriot.

"Who would have thought succubi could do that......."

As Herriot says, it's ridiculous.

Right now, the succubi were acting like psychotherapists.
