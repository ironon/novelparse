            Episode 528.





It is only speculation that Heinrich may have been illegitimate.

But when you think of it that way, the loose ends of the chain of events are completely connected.

Why Heinrich was not sent to an academy inside Cernstadt.

Why it was necessary to kill Heinrich, who was gradually becoming a hero in this situation.

A rootless bastard is the hero of Cernstadt, and may even surpass Louise von Schwarz as the heir to the throne.

For pure-blooded royalty, that would be absolutely unacceptable.

"Maybe if this is true, Heinrich doesn't know about this."

We don't know if this is really true or not.

"Solenin, the current queen of Cernstadt, is a very unruly woman, with an obsession with manners, decency, and protocol. It's ridiculous, but it's something I or Bertus should learn from, though we haven't seen much of it."

The queen of an empire. But a queen with better manners and dignity than an empire.

But it's all a fa√ßade, and no one sees the Queen of Cernstadt as equal to or superior to the imperial royalty.

"But he's a bastard....... The mere thought of such a scandal would give me a seizure. No, it's not just creepy, it's something to hang yourself with a rope over."

"So....... rather than....... as his own child, is that it?"

"It would have been easier to kill him, but Constantin von Schwarz, King of Cernstadt, was known to be a big man, and he might have been a big man about the treatment of his illegitimate children, but he could have accepted them, but he couldn't love them, and I don't think he could have done anything about that."

When she's finished, Charlotte drinks the rest of her tea and exhales.

"It's all speculation, after all. Maybe they weren't really illegitimate or anything, maybe the royals loved their dead fourth and fifth children so much that they couldn't help but hate the youngest."

It's just presenting a possibility, a reasonable possibility, Charlotte says. It's just telling us what Temple assumed.

But isn't that a cruel possibility, too close to the truth?

Can Heinrich understand or accept this?

"That's as much as I can tell you, but I'm not sure how to convince Heinrich."

You are a bastard.

So you might be killed by your brothers. No, your brothers must kill you. They have to kill you before you can be considered a greater hero, so that there's no chance of the throne passing to a bastard.

A bastard who killed two pure-blooded royals.

I find it rather strange that I don't hate Heinrich.

He's even become so powerful that he's now considered a hero in Cernstadt.

I had templed him to stay out of sight, shoved him in a corner, and now I'm forced to treat him like a brother.

You're going to be crushed.

"Hmmm, if I go to Heinrich and tell him that you're a bastard and you're going to die if you don't get on my side, what's to stop him from turning around and roasting me?"

"That's right......."

Charlotte smiled wryly.



* * *



The late-night consultation is over.

I didn't get the answer I was looking for, but I knew what I needed to do.

I was also able to deduce, to a certain extent, the facts about how the loose bits I had woven were woven together.

I ate my meal and drank my tea.

But for some reason, I was disappointed, and Charlotte and I were aesthetically pleased.

It's nothing personal, but it's been a while since I've had a conversation with Charlotte that felt like a conversation.

We sat on the terrace in a daze, not knowing what to do.

It needs to be said.

"......Want to go for a walk?"

"Huh? Ah. Yeah. Okay."

As if waiting for the words, Charlotte nodded vigorously.



* * *



Charlotte and I left the royal castle and walked the plains outside of Rajak.

Along the way, I saw the city of Razak to my left and the refugee camp to my right.





As Charlotte had planned, there were occasional sightings of supposed vigilantes wandering around with torches.

The incorrigible.

The cruel Charlotte's plan to purge them and form a new vigilante group when the time comes.

The reason it's cruel isn't because Charlotte encourages them to be corrupt.

This is because the vigilante's corruption is a sin of their own choosing. Corrupt vigilantes who are later punished cannot escape the shackles of their sinful choices.

You've been taken advantage of, but you'll be judged without even knowing it.

Charlotte knows how humans behave in certain situations.

Because there are those who will crawl into the predicted quagmire without being told, and they will be replenished by others.

That's why this policy is cruel.

I'm not sure at what stage that got to.

We will no longer be bringing in survivors from the continent.

This means that Edina's population will never increase due to outside influx.

You only need to manage people who are already in Edina.

We've saved so many lives.

But that's just a drop in the bucket compared to the actual number of people who died.

That set off a chain of events that eventually led to something I don't even want to think about.

We walk together, Charlotte watching from a distance as the torches come and go in the refugee camp.

"How's the regent thing going, is it worth it?"

"I don't know if it's working or not, but I'm doing it, and now I have some idea of what's going on with Edina. Things are going to get better."

"Good."

It's only going to get better.

That sounded good, but it also sounded like a statement that things were so bad, they couldn't possibly get any worse.

Am I too twisted?

"Most of all, I'm glad the demons aren't complaining. If....... under normal circumstances, there would have been more of a backlash from the demons than the humans."

"Sure."

Even though the demons have no reason to live among humans, they obey because their king has ordered them to.

Reign of the Demon is both idealized and bizarre for this reason.

If a society is made up entirely of demons and not humans, the demon king can rule for life with no opposition.

Eleris told me that she was once an Archdemon, but her horns were broken and she was banished by her own son, the only demon who could resist her.

Demon.

And the Empress.

Charlotte, now my regent.

When we first met, I wonder if this future was meant to be.

"Charlotte."

"Yes."

"I don't remember ever being a demon prince."

Charlotte stops walking at my words and looks up at me.

"I was thrown into the world, knowing only that I was the son of the demon Valier."

Suddenly, the day I told her the story, Charlotte was staring at me wordlessly.

"When I met you, I didn't know who you were."

"......."

"I'm not going to tell you all the lies I told you, all the excuses I had to make."

Charlotte just stood there, listening to me.

"But....... You owe me an apology."

"......."

"I'm so sorry for all the lies I've told you."

I'm not sure how to make my apology sound sincere.

I don't think this is enough to forgive me for deceiving Charlotte.

However, I think we need to talk about it properly.

I don't think it's something that should be put off because you're busy, because you have too many other things to do.

Charlotte looks at me apologetically and smiles.

"Three times."

"Three times?"

"Once in the Demon Castle, once in the Palace of Spring, and once this time. Three times like that."

Charlotte looks at me.

The number of times I saved Charlotte.

It seemed to say that.

"At this point, I feel like the world hates me, and somehow I'm supposed to die, but you've saved me over and over again, and I wonder what will happen next. I wonder if there's something else I have to die for."

It was a cloudy night with no stars or moon.

"You're weird."

"......."

"You're supposed to hate me."

"Hate?"

"Yes."

Charlotte looks up at the night sky.

"You saved me time and time again, and I didn't trust you, even though I had no choice but to think so. You saved me, and you did it with the purest of intentions, and I didn't trust you and cursed you."

I thought it could be.

So many lies piled on top of each other to create a tower of misinformation that was more compelling than the truth.

So I was thinking it was inevitable.

I don't blame Charlotte.

"You had no choice but to do it."

Charlotte smiles bitterly at my words.

"You resent and curse me for not trusting you when you've saved and protected me so many times. If you had, it would have been unavoidable."

Resenting Charlotte for not knowing my heart.

Was that even possible for me?

"I did it because I had to, and you didn't resent it because you had to."

"The difference between ....... I think it's pretty big."

"You're the one who did what I couldn't, and then I feel a little weird when I realize that you still don't resent me one bit."

"What am I, I've never done anything for you, I've always been there for you, I've even let you down at a crucial moment, and yet I've come to your rescue like I'm supposed to......."

"I'm not sure."

"So now I feel distant from you."

"I'm not sure I can do anything for you, and I don't think I'll ever be able to repay you."

It's something Charlotte has to do for me.

What Charlotte must do for me, not the Regent's work.

There is no such thing.

I don't really have a wish list.

"Just, you know, be healthy and live well."

"I thought you'd say that."

Charlotte giggled, covering her mouth.

Maybe I should have said something more.

I need you, even if it's not exactly a regent's job. I want you to always be within my sight.

Maybe I should have said that.

Charlotte was the first life I saved when I arrived in this world.

Because of this, I realize that I have a different kind of attachment to Charlotte than I do to anyone else.

"There's something I want to do with you."

Charlotte says to me.

"What do you want to do?"

"Yeah, I can do that right now."

What do you want to do with me at this hour?

When I stared at her like I didn't know what she was talking about, she fumbled in her arms and pulled out something.

"Here, let's eat this."

It was a biscuit wrapped in a paper wrapper.

It symbolizes the first time we met.

I'm carrying this in my arms.

Someday, when we have this conversation, are we going to eat together?

"Good."

At my answer, Charlotte smiled wryly, then unwrapped the biscuit and snapped it in half, precisely.

That was the case then, too.

I broke the biscuit I'd given Charlotte to eat in half and handed it to myself.

I felt an odd sensation as I watched Charlotte hand me half of it, unable to keep it for herself, even at the moment the bone was served.

I wonder if that's what Charlotte was thinking when I handed her the biscuit.

He looked at me as if I had given him something he couldn't even eat in that moment.

Charlotte popped a halved biscuit into my mouth, then into her own.

You've been carrying biscuits around to give to me someday.

That's how much he wanted to talk to me, and he was always ready to talk.

It wasn't until long after Charlotte came to Edina that I was able to tell her the story of our first meeting.

We eat biscuits, leaning against each other, on a hill with a view of Rajak and the refugee camps.

Of course, it's not the same biscuit.

"It doesn't taste the same."

"That's just the way it is."

Charlotte and I nibble on biscuits.

Circumstances being what they are, they are objectively worse than the ones I ate back then. Of course, that was the high quality stuff the demon prince was carrying, and the biscuits available in Edina are a yawn compared to that.

The gourmet biscuits you ate when no matter what you ate, it had to be good.

A plain biscuit that you eat when you're not particularly hungry.

It can't be the same flavor.

Charlotte said that no matter what she ate, she didn't think she could eat anything better than those biscuits, so after that, she was okay with whatever she ate. She said she didn't have to choose what she ate anymore.

That's what happened on the ecliptic.

Although it doesn't taste the same.

At least we can eat biscuits together.

You can go around and around, and eventually, you can be together.

We don't resent each other anymore, and we don't hate each other.

I don't have to lie to Charlotte anymore.

"Reinhardt."

"Uh."

"When this is all over, what are you going to do?"

Charlotte asks, taking a bite out of her biscuit.

After it's all over. After the Gate debacle.

Until I survive the final fight, and things with Ellen are somehow resolved.

If I'm still alive by then.

What to do.

"I don't know."

I don't know if I'll even be around in the future, and it's too much to think about until later.

I'm not the kind of person who can think too far into the future without knowing for sure.

Heinrich is about to be assassinated, and we don't have any answers, and it's all over.

"War....... Probably, unavoidable."

"......I think so."

"Yeah, after everything is finalized. The continent will know we have a home in Edina at some point, I don't know when, but it will happen."

Charlotte is the regent.

It's a place to think about the future. And it's something I, as the king, must think about.

After the Gate is over, humanity will deal with the monsters left on the continent and lay the groundwork for rebuilding.

We can create our own paradise here, far away from the continent, breathing down our necks.

But they can't stay away from each other forever.

No matter when it happens, humanity and Edina are bound to collide.

Charlotte's point about war is not new. I've been thinking about it myself.

But there is a war to be fought.

The more humanity rebuilds, the better things get, the more humanity's vendetta to kill me, the cause of this, will want to be resolved.

If word spreads that the Devil has taken up residence in Edina, you'll have to fight off humanity's conquering forces.

If you think it's not going to happen in the short term, it will happen.

Charlotte taps me on the shoulder when I seem to be struggling.

I turned my head and Charlotte was looking at me, her head tilted at a slight angle.

"Do you want me to tell you something funny?"

"......what?"

"Because you're with me, you can claim to be the heir to the Gradias Empire."

What is he talking about?

"And you've got two holy relics, which means you can claim influence over the Order. Or, well, you could reform the Great Cult into the Holy Order, put Olivia Ranze in charge, and then absorb their power. It's possible."

"What are you talking about?"

It was a scary story.

"Of course the demons will follow your lead, not to mention you."

Charlotte looks at me.

"Reinhardt."

What are you trying to say.

It sent shivers down my spine.

"You could be the ruler of the whole world, not just an empire."

You are not the emperor of mankind, nor the king of demons.

Ruler of the world.

"You think the humans hate and loathe you, so they won't accept your rule?"

Charlotte smiled subtly, as if she knew without being told.

"People don't live as subjects of the Gradias Empire because they support the Empire."

"......."

"Rule is passive, whether it's House Gradias at the top or the demon they hate. They don't need convincing, and they never have."

Dominance is just that, dominance.

No need for crowd support.

"A ruler need only be strong. Strong enough that the lesser ones don't dare to try and overturn it, that's all. The way you protect the people of this Edina makes you a ruler, an oppressor of humanity disguised as oppression and terror."

Hatred of humanity.

If it's going to jump on me one day, I can jump on them first.

If it's a war that's going to happen, you'd rather face it head-on than fear it, or even consider invading it first, right?

"Bertus is....... What?"

At my words, Charlotte buries her head between her knees.

"They'll let me live....... I believe that."

Continental Emperor.

King of the world.

It's not that it wasn't on my radar.

Nor did he believe that the ruler of humanity had to be an empire.

But, Charlotte said, it's time to start thinking about that big topic.

"Just....... As it is, I think you're only thinking about what else you'll lose when it's all over, and you're afraid of that."

"......."

"Instead of losing something, you might gain something."

That was pretty far out of the scope of my thinking.

Charlotte looks at me.

"I just wanted to let you know that it's possible to have it all, to miss nothing, to feel that way."

After the gate, a war breaks out, and someone dies.

We lose someone in Edina.

It's not.

You can have everything in the world.

That's what Charlotte was saying.

Can there be a country where all the people hate the king?

Can such a thing be established?

Even if it can be established, should there be such a thing?

In terms of what's possible and what's not, it's probably possible.

If you make hate into fear, you can control it.

If my fear is greater than my hatred of me, I can keep humanity under my feet, no matter how much they hate me.

But can I afford it.

I can't do anything about this little island nation, so I leave it to Charlotte.

Do you have the slightest flicker of insanity to do such a crazy thing as be king of the world?

"......."

Is it okay to try to have it all because you don't want to lose any of it?
