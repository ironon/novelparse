            Episode 585.





Louise told Heinrich a shocking story.

Ruiz recognized that there was a secret to the Allies' too-easy advance, but he didn't see the need to uncover it now.

But it was still hard to believe that the devil was leading the charge.

But if that's the truth, it makes sense that the empire was forced to be silent.

When this truth begins to spread, people will doubt the devil's motives.

As confused as Ruiz is now, if word of this gets out to the Allies, it's going to spell trouble.

So the empire is forced to pretend that they are in control, even as they enlist the help of the devil.

"It's clear that the Empire is more than a tacit partnership with the Devil."

It is hard to believe that his son had fallen for the devil's trick-or-treating. If that were the case, Heinrich had no reason to remain with the Allies. His life was in danger, and he had no choice but to leave.

"The empire is....... the devil and......."

He could have had his son taken away by the devil.

But, to put it another way, the demon was trying to save her son.

"If there is a truth we don't know, what do you think it is?"

"I don't know, if the devil didn't want Gate to happen....... Then why the hell did it happen....... Why is the Empire hiding the truth....... I don't know."

The demon did not tell Heinrich the truth, which would be dangerous for him to know.

Heinrich stares at Louise in confusion.

"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to confuse you, but....... I felt like I had to tell you......."

"......."

Louise didn't have to think too hard to realize why this was happening.

Most people believe that the devil is the source of all evil, and the few who know the truth encourage their beliefs.

But if there's any truth to the Gate debacle other than what everyone knows.

If it's true that the devil really didn't want the gate to happen.

Then what's the world coming to.

If this situation, so strongly held together by hatred of the Devil, breaks down, humanity will end.

Heinrich sees the confusion in Louise's eyes, and finally bows his head.

"Maybe I'm possessed by the devil, but....... I can't help but think so, so I'm going to......."

"No. Well said. Well said......."

Louise still couldn't escape her confusion, but she couldn't help but praise her son's courage in telling her about his secret meeting with the devil.

Louise's head was spinning from Heinrich's words.

What is the Devil really like, what is the truth about the Gate debacle, and what is the Empire thinking?

I don't know anything.

But even if you have a truth that not everyone in the world knows, does it matter?

Regardless of the intentions, the gate incident happened and it needs to end, and that doesn't change in the face of any truth.

It's still snowing.

It's snowing hard.

The snow piles up.

Snow covers everything.

No land, no buildings, no trees, no frozen rivers.

Overwrites them all.

A gate event is like this snow.

A snowstorm so massive that it buries everything.

When it's snowing hard, everything else loses importance.

Snow must be cleared. You have to keep clearing it so it doesn't cover everything and bring it down.

Just as you have to clear the snow before it engulfs the world, eventually nothing else matters but the snow.

The truth was also buried in the snowstorm that was the Gate debacle, now invisible and unimportant.

We need to end the gating debacle.

That absolute drowned out all truth and justice.

Hence another absolute: buried truths don't matter.

Louise von Schwarz couldn't help but realize it.

But if the devil really is such a thing.

If you're on the front lines of the fight to end gatekeeping, but no one in the world recognizes it.

"If what you say is true and....... if that's really the case."

How scary, how strong, and how.

Also, what a sad existence.

"It's sad, all this."

Louise looks up at the sky and exhales wistfully.

Heinrich and Louise walked down Temple Street in a daze.

What the Devil said to Heinrich may have been a lie.

But it's also hard to believe that the devil was lying. If he was trying to deceive, he should have said something.

It's going to be dangerous, come with me.

Follow me and I'll tell you what's happened so far.

That's all he said, and he even backed down when Heinrich refused.

Heinrich's opinion was the result of his own thinking and judgment about the demon and what was happening in the Alliance.

The idea that the Devil had been watching the Allied garrison all this time was very eerie to Louise, but in the end, the Devil hadn't even tried to trick Heinrich.

In fact, Heinrich's life was indeed in danger. An assassination attempt was made, but Louise was able to stop it.

If Ruiz hadn't intervened, Heinrich would have died.

The Devil did not want Heinrich to kill his brothers, nor did he want to be killed.

That's why we wanted Heinrich on board.

When the demon visited Heinrich, he did not say anything except that an assassination attempt would take place.

So there was only Heinrich's judgment.

It was a strange thing for Louise to think about.

He's hated by his brothers, his life is in danger, and he doesn't know the truth about Louise.

"The youngest."

"Yes, sister."

"Was leaving....... was not right."

"That would have been right, in the moment."

"Yes, you were dangerous and you didn't know what was coming. I didn't know I was going to do that...... either."

Heinrich's decision to stay behind when he wasn't sure of his safety could only be considered foolish.

"I had my reasons, but....... I could see what would happen if I left: it would affect our soldiers, our officers, our royalty, and even Cernstadt."

"ah......."

Louise was dumbfounded, as she hadn't expected Heinrich to be of that mindset.

"Even with my lack of brains, I could see that people were going to look at me like that."

"......."

"So I decided not to leave."

Whatever the reason, it's a betrayal.

The Cult of Tuan, the Cult of Als, and the Duchy of St. Tuan would be viewed the same way by those from Cernstadt.

I thought about it, so I didn't leave, even though I knew it was dangerous.

Louise felt her breath catch in her throat.

"And....... If I had left, there would have been nothing like this, no time like this, no....... forever. I wouldn't have known anything."

He would never know that not all of his brothers hated him, that there were some who were just too difficult to deal with and were holding back.

"I'm glad you didn't leave."

Heinrich looks at Louise.

War has changed so much, and it has caused so much misery.

But not everything changes for the worse. Heinrich had become a man who could think about a lot of things.

Moved and sorry, Louise couldn't find the right words to say.

Louise had so much to be grateful for in her son, who knew the truth and was grateful and accepting of the situation instead of hating himself.

I don't know how long we walked in that pleasant silence.

"......Hmm?"

As they walked, a distant voice stopped them in their tracks.

On the other side of the road, a group of guards blocked their path.

"Is this a restricted area?"

"I think so......."

The guards didn't say anything to Heinrich and Ruiz, but the shape of the road they were blocking made it clear that this was a controlled area.

I was just walking down the street and ended up in a place I wouldn't normally be.

"Looks like....... university grounds."

"I see, so you wouldn't know."

But it's a restricted area. Louise and Heinrich stared at the grounds and buildings beyond, where guards blocked their path. The guards in the distance pay them little attention, as if their staring is not a problem in itself.

But is there a good reason to control access?

With so few passersby, no one would dare to step foot there.

"If there are no people coming or going, and it's a controlled area, I'd say......."

There must be something going on inside that is confidential.

And the size of the guard in the distance was unusually large. We don't know what they're doing, but with a guard of that size, there must be something even bigger going on inside.

"It must be a wizarding university."

Heinrich looked at the sign and nodded slowly as if he recognized the university inside the gated area.

"It's a wizarding university....... Yeah, they must be doing research on something."

Louise nodded in acknowledgment, thinking that the Empire would then be able to treat it as confidential.

"Are you trying to build another one of those Titans? I mean, it would be great for everybody if we had another weapon like that......."

"Probably not the Titan, I'm told they don't have the money to build one more airframe."

"Oh yeah, so they're making another big magic weapon or something?"

"Anything that helps the war effort is good."

"It should be......."

Titans.

The sight of it sent a shiver of fear through Louise. Over and over again, she thought to herself, thank God those steps belonged to us.

Anyone who opposed the Empire, even if it was a demonic army, would be trampled underfoot and turned to dust.

The Empire is doing something at the Temple College of Magic. They're not Titans, but they're working on something.

"I think my classmates in B were included in the study. They're at Temple, and I've rarely seen them return to their dorms from Hogwarts."

Heinrich didn't know the details, but he could guess that Louis Ankton, Christina, and Anna de Gerna were involved in the research going on over there.

"Didn't the Titan Project also involve a child named Adelia, your friend......."

"Yes, I did."

Adelia's power cartridge was a great invention, but the Titan is a feat that far surpasses it.

But this time, other classmates are involved.

What kind of weapon would that be?

"All of your friends are....... are all freakishly brilliant kids."

Kids from Temple's sophomore class.

Louise couldn't help but think that there was a strange collection of monstrously talented people in that grade.

It's a weird mix of geniuses and disasters.

What a terrible coincidence.

Louise and Heinrich walked slowly through the snowy streets of Temple, leaving the College of Magic behind.



* * *



Ludwig left the guard headquarters with a despondent look on his face.

The rubble of the crumbling temple could not have killed Ludwig. After securing Rowen's body from the pile of crumbling stones, Ludwig confronted the guards who had come to clean up the fire.

He was handed over to Guard headquarters, offering to cooperate fully with the investigation.

But the answer Ludwig heard stunned him.

'......It's hard.'

"It's hard......?

'Yes, if they were arrested at the scene. If a mob, not one or two, but dozens, attacked the temple and scattered....... If it was an accidental crime, not an organized one....... It's going to be very difficult to find the suspects.'

'I saw it with my own eyes. I saw people looting temples and fleeing....... Not all of them, but I saw them. I remember it.'

'Mr. Ludwig. The population of the ecliptic is now over a hundred million. And if this was done by people in the refugee camps who are not even properly identified....... it's virtually impossible to catch the culprits.'

If the raiders are hiding in an alleyway in a maze of refugee camps, it's impossible to find them.

'And the weather is like this.......'

When you have enough on your plate dealing with a snowstorm, you don't have the manpower, and even if you did, it would be nearly impossible to find the culprit.

Ludwig didn't know what to say.

The reality of the ecliptic gradient is that it's nearly impossible to catch the culprit unless it's happening right in front of you.

Accidental crime, accidental arson, accidental looting.

The coincidences made it virtually impossible to catch the culprits, the security forces said, even before the investigation began.

The deep weariness in the director's expression made me realize that he wasn't saying this because he was being disingenuous.

'But....... Just like this, just like this, just like....... no investigation, no nothing, just like that?

Guards have the power of summary execution because, at the very least, they are supposed to maintain order in society.

But if there's an event that causes a complete breakdown of social order, and you give up on this, what has the Guard been doing all this time?

If the guards aren't doing their job, I don't think they should have the right to kill people willy-nilly.

At Ludwig's puzzled expression, the head of the guard sighed heavily.

'Ludwig, and in the first place, this case is....... Even if we wanted to investigate it, we wouldn't be able to.'

'What does that....... sound?

"Arson, looting, and murder at the temple of the Great Lord.

Ludwig had some intuition as to why the head of the guard didn't recognize him.

"This is something the Crusaders should be authorized to do.

Maybe they're not willing to investigate, but even if they were, it wouldn't be something they could investigate.

The scene was cleared, but the Crusaders would investigate the incident themselves.

'I don't know if the Crusaders will be able to properly track down the people who did this, but....... Perhaps we should turn the case over to the Crusaders.

Hearing that, Ludwig came out of the district guard headquarters.

Rowen is dead.

Most of the people who stayed in the temple died.

And it's virtually impossible to find the culprits.

Ludwig walks down the street in a daze.

Archbishop Rowen.

He was weird, but he was never evil.

We don't know if the mob's goal was food for the temple or anger at the Tuan Order.

But Rowen, who hadn't even gotten a break from traveling the streets to help people, was literally and figuratively murdered.

Why.

Why so.

And it doesn't even get caught?

Trading the life of someone who could save tens of thousands of people for a slice of bread?

That doesn't make sense.

This shouldn't happen.

Even the security forces say they won't be able to find them, and they can't afford to.

Ludwig is not overconfident.

I don't think I can do anything that a guard can't do.

This is a job that requires brains, not brawn.

And it's a job that requires power to get involved in the case.

Ludwig had gotten that far.

You want to get involved, but you don't have the power, and you don't have the brains to solve the case.

I need help.

Help from someone.

It's really, really needed.

That the people who did this should be punished.

Ludwig thought to himself as he walked down the street, wide-eyed.
