            Episode 294.





-Waaaaaah!

Some people in the audience were cheering, but others who had been following the tournament since yesterday were confused.

"What the hell, why did Reinhardt lose!"

Olivia Ranze blurted out, not understanding.

This was mostly the case in Royal Class. Even the B class was like that.

The undefeated Reinhardt repeatedly backed away from Scarlett, only to be pushed back and drop the first set.

Without any magical enhancements, she was simply being pushed back. Sure, Scarlett's swordplay was flashy and quick, and she found the right gaps.

Reinhardt was strangely helpless.

Everyone in the room realizes that things are a little weird, but they don't know what exactly is weird.

"I'm not using my superpowers."

Except for Ellen.

"......what?"

"I'm not using my superpowers."

No one else does, but Ellen does.

Having shared a sword with Reinhardt more times than she can count, Ellen knows everything about his sword. When he uses it, when he doesn't, and when he uses it and uses the power of temporary enhancement. Ellen knew every detail of it.

So now Ellen could see that Reinhardt was somehow not using the power of self-suggestion at all.

"Why can't I use it?"

"I don't know."

It was Harriet who spoke up at Ellen's words.

"That....... I thought her powers were immune. Maybe that has something to do with it?"

Ellen doesn't know much about Class B's work, but Harriet does, thanks to the Magical Research Society. Immunity, a very unique but very powerful talent, depending on the circumstances.

At the suggestion that it might be working, Ellen nodded.

"So, you're saying Reinhardt can't use his superpowers......."

"What the hell, Reinhardt has a superpower of organs and it's not fair to let him use them, ahhh!"

Olivia sulked, and we all agreed that superpowers were already cheating enough.

The guy who's ridiculously pro-Reinhardt now knows that Reinhardt is a great man who would defend him no matter what he did, no matter what the reason.

He's too tired to talk about, so it's best to let him rampage on his own.

Bottom line.

An odd talent called immunity.

That's what makes Reinhardt so influential.

Hearing that, Saviolin Tana looked at Reinhardt, who had been recalled to the match for the second set.

Charlotte watched Scarlett and Reinhardt.

Scarlett, Reinhardt.

They both mean different things to you, but they are important to you.

They are the ones who feel sorry for the other when their heart leans one way or the other.

But this time, we're up against a bad opponent.

"What will happen?"

At Charlotte's question, Saviolin Tana shook her head.

"Reinhardt must be hard."

Saviolin Tana doesn't know much about Reinhardt's psychic powers, but if he can't even use his magical enhancements as a result, it's a no-win situation.

"Unless you summon Tiamata.

But that's not something you can easily show.

Saviolin Tana predicted Reinhardt's defeat.

If she had met Scarlett in the final, she could have been runner-up, or if she had fallen in the other group in the quarterfinals, she could have won.

As a result.

Reinhardt had very bad luck.



* * *



I ended up handing over the next set similarly to the first.

-Current set score 2:0! If Scarlett can take one more set, she's guaranteed a spot in the finals!

The moderator's voice rang in my ears like a madman.

The screen alternated between a calm Scarlett and a tense me. She said she would do her best, and she was.

I also did my best in practice matches, maximizing my strength.

Scarlett has been dealing with me without using her powers so far.

Scarlett does her best to honor me, or at least pay homage to me.

The words "cut her some slack" rose to the top of my throat, but they wouldn't leave my mouth. I have my powers, and Scarlett has hers.

They just take advantage of each other.

Scarlett doesn't laugh at me when I'm losing badly, and she doesn't worry about me.

I'm your idol?

Why am I your idol when I am so weak in your presence?

I know I'm not talking about the skill part, of course, but in front of Scarlett's expressionless face, I couldn't find a way to get through to him.

I was using a superpower to leapfrog an opponent who had a significant skill gap in the first place.

With those tools unavailable, there was no way I could overpower Scarlett.

I hadn't expected to be stopped by Scarlett.

I hadn't considered the possibility that Scarlett's talents might block my superpowers, and since that wasn't possible in the original, I figured it couldn't be possible here.

Using Riana as an example, in the original game, if Riana's Charge hits Scarlett, it does no damage to Scarlett.

Right now, Riana won't even be able to trigger a charge in front of Scarlett.

I had to admit it.

I was arrogant.

I wasn't thinking about Scarlett, I was thinking about the final after Scarlett.

But the reality is that I struggled here, dropped two sets, and now have to accept defeat.

There's no way to beat it.

After all, superpowers were most of me. In Scarlett's case, it was a bad match.

Rest assured, Scarlett is the only one in the world with that level of immunity.

When you wonder if the price of arrogance is defeat.

"Did you give up?"

The start of set 3 has already been announced, and Scarlett asks without approaching.

"......."

"Is it because I'm a superhuman who just happened to have superpowers, and without them, I'm an incompetent, shitty person who can't do magic or anything else?"

Scarlett says, "That's not true. Is that a criticism of me?

Are you laughing at me, calling me pathetic, a dog running away with its tail between its legs because there's nothing left to believe in?

It didn't sound like it.

"It's not."

Scarlett says, pointing her sword at me.

"When you're fighting with a third grader, and you know no one's going to help you, and you know you're only going to get worse if you get up, but you keep....... You kept getting up."

Scarlett takes a step toward me.

"I remember the look in your eyes."

What I was thinking then.

It was a long time ago, so I don't remember much about it. But sometimes, what you go through, someone else remembers better.

Scarlett seemed to think so.

It was a powerful memory for me, but it seemed to be even more powerful for Scarlett.

With nothing to play for and everyone wanting me to lose, I got up and kept getting up even as I was getting beaten, blown up, and knocked down.

My side was nowhere to be found.

Still, I managed to get up and give Mayarton a run for his money, eventually awakening his superpowers.

The look in his eyes, of course, is my look, so I don't know.

But Scarlett remembered.

"Show me that look again."

Scarlett slowly walks toward me.

They don't come to hold my hand, they come to point a sword at me.

Emotions are inherently unbalanced.

Scarlett was not important to me, but I was important to her. I hadn't done anything for her, but she had taken something from me, and through her efforts to make sense of it and to change, she had become a different person, with different abilities.

That's why Scarlett says I'm her idol.

Scarlett doesn't want me to give up here.

They don't want to see their idol run off with his tail between his legs because his powers are finally sealed.

Just like then.

You want to see them grit their teeth and get up and do something.

Scarlett doesn't know me. She only idolizes me. In her idolization, Scarlet has a version of me that she wants me to be, and it's not the real me.

A magnified, self-defined, and in a sense deified part of myself.

Scarlett wants something from me.

There's no reason for me to fulfill that wish.

This is coercion.

You can do it.

So show me.

Show me that I'm no match for you.

In Scarlett's calm, serene eyes, I see a certain intensity that he wishes for me.

Someone who I hope will forever remain my hero, someone who I hope will continue to be in front of me by becoming an even greater person.......

Obsession.

Painful childhood experiences twist people. Scarlett is no exception.

The memories of the streets and the bullying at the Temple, where Scarlett had been twisted. She may have gotten out of the quagmire, but she could not help but give herself over to a new twist.

Scarlett found her salvation in me, not in Charlotte.

Therefore, the nation that has found salvation wants me to stick to my way of life.

Like you've always done, even when you know you shouldn't.

This time, you're going to be your own trial, and you're going to hopefully overcome it.

Now that my superpowers have been neutralized, I'm not much different than I was at Mayaton in my first semester.

Scarlett turned me into a first-semester nerd.

As in, get over it.

What if I lose, what if I don't find the answer.

Will Scarlett be disappointed in me?

If you're disappointed, what's next.

Does he despair when he realizes I can no longer be his idol?

There's no reason I should be responsible for all those feelings. Scarlett only idolizes me and tests me.

However, I learned the real reason Scarlett entered the tournament.

I wasn't trying to prove anything.

It was for a completely different reason than the original.

Scarlett entered the tournament to make me prove something, not herself.

He knew he was his own worst enemy, and he wanted to see me surpass myself.

It can't fulfill every wish, and there's no reason it should.

I never said I wanted to be your idol, and there's no reason I should be.

Scarlet is no better.

He's not better, he's different.

He had a life that was bound to be twisted, he just met me and got twisted in a different way.

Scarlett.

I didn't always feel comfortable around him.

I'm a victim of what I think is a weird setup: being bullied for having red hair and red eyes.

It felt uncomfortable and weird, like my mistakes were walking around in real life every time I saw them. So when Charlotte protected Scarlett, I felt a little less guilty.

Somehow that worked out.

I felt a strange sense of guilt and relief that someone else had solved my problem.

Maybe I was hoping someone would fix it for me because I didn't want to ruin the original storyline, and I knew it was a cop-out, but I let it happen anyway.

But the answer was actually on my end, not Charlotte's.

I don't know what happens when Scarlett can no longer idolize me. But the Scarlett who idolizes me gets along with everyone and tries to stand up for herself.

Any problems that arise from idolizing me will only happen to me.

He might force me to do something, he might have unreasonable expectations of me, and he might be unreasonably disappointed.

If yes.

It's a fitting price to pay for my part in creating your misery.

"Yes, Scarlett."

If anything, it cleared my head.

I grip my sword and point it at Scarlett, who takes a step closer.

Self-implication is unresponsive.

"I don't know what you want from me."

But that doesn't mean the experience is gone.

The answer is only there.

"I'll show you more than that."

Enchantment.

Without even the aid of self-implication, it has to be done.

You might get hurt, you might get injured.

If you get knocked out, you don't win.

But, hey, it's okay. My classmate, the one who says I'm his idol, the one who wants to live with what's broken and too late to fix, says something to me.

He lived the misery I described.

You can't fix it, but you can live with it.

It can do that much.

I don't feel it, but I've felt it.

It doesn't seem possible, but I've done it.

Like going from a tetrapod to a unicycle.

It's a short ride.

Believing you can get a little further.

It doesn't generate as much power as faith, but that's what faith is in the first place.

It's rather odd that the power has been generated as you believe.

In the first place, faith is an unanswered echo.

Therefore, I believe, as all humans do, having regressed to a primal state of faith.

I, can.

You've harnessed the power that runs through your body before, so there's no reason why you can't do it again.

I nudge the things that feel right.

Scarlett watches me.

-Woof

The feeling of exhilaration in my body was like nothing I'd ever felt before.

Without the aid of self-suggestion, I am only now truly on the path to superhumanity.

"...... You did it."

"Yeah."

Scarlett was more pleased than I was that I had gotten stronger.

You're broken.

Just like the rest of the world.

Like I'm responsible for every bad thing that happened to you.

If you've overcome all your problems by idolizing me, if you're the way you are because I'm always in front of you.

"Here we go."

Forever, I will remain your idol.
