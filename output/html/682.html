            Episode 682.





Time has passed.

As Charlotte planned, the wedding will be a low-key affair.

But that wedding has a lot of meaning.

It's a proclamation of a new empire, and it formalizes that humanity has been trampled underfoot by the devil.

Empress Gradias is now completely at the feet of the Demon King.

The emperor fled.

It means that Charlotte de Gradias, the last heir to the House of Gradias, has become a half-demon and is now the bride of a demon.

I announce that Louise von Schwarz of Cernstadt, First Empress, has become the Devil's bride, and the Kingdom of Schwarz has come under the Devil's control.

Olivia Ranze is also a pure saint who betrays her doctrine and becomes a bride of the devil, signifying the subjugation of the Five Great Houses to the devil.

There is a demonic bride there, which means that there will be an era of humans and demons in the future.

In the case of Herriot de Saint-Ouen, it may not mean as much as others, but those who have seen and heard of his exploits on the battlefield know.

The world's greatest wizard has become the devil's bride.

With the wedding, a new empire is proclaimed.

And the chaos that followed.

Whether it's prosperity or something else that comes after chaos.

It would be the beginning of what would be another long, long day.

The night before your wedding.

I was sitting alone in my bedroom.

I wanted to be alone.

"......."

On the table in front of him was a bottle of whiskey that he'd pulled out of a display case.

I'm a crazy person who drinks on the eve of a wedding, but it doesn't really matter.

If you want to break it, you can break it.

Think about what you've lost.

That may seem like a lot, but it's not all lost.

EpinHauser.

Loyar.

People in the Rotary Club.

They became immortalized regardless of whether I won or lost.

There's no coming back.

Would they be happy to see me now?

I'm not sure.

This time, I think about the things I don't know.

Bertus and Saviolin Tana are gone.

Shanapelle and the Imperial Mages were also scattered.

Christina and Ludwig are nowhere to be found, nor are Anna and Louis Ankton.

The Immortal may be gone, but the magic that created it remains.

They don't know what happened either.

And Antony.

I don't even know if Antony is lurking somewhere, waiting to breathe down my neck.

The deal was done, and Antirrhinus would have killed me.

But it didn't die.

I don't know what happened to that either.

And.

Also.

Survive to the point after the ending.

I don't even know what that means.

Isn't this after the ending?

The gate debacle is over.

So what is an ending?

If you leave me alone for the rest of my life, that's good enough for me.

The important thing is that things like event notifications are no longer responsive.

Things like information, challenges, and retirements.

I don't see those things anymore.

As of my last departure, that ability seems to have disappeared.

I wonder if this is the only reward I'll ever get.

If that's the reward, I guess it's not a bad thing.

If they wanted to take me somewhere now that it was all over, that would have been even worse.

The system is gone.

As if disappearing after the ending is a virtue.

The rest of the world is yours.

No cheats, no help, no messages. Things like previews.

It will no longer be in my life.

The last preview was not malicious.

I was taking it like, "Oh, get ready to die," or something like that.

In fact, it was meant to let me know that if I accepted the last transaction, it would be.

Yes.

Fucking asshole.

Glad you were able to help at the last minute.

What's lost is lost.

Don't know what you don't know.

What's done is done.

I will have to live for the next moment.

You take a sip of whiskey and look out the window.

A pale full moon was rising in the window, casting a soft glow into my unlit bedroom.

Probably.

I don't know how long I'll be able to live with it.

For the rest of my life, I will look at the moon and think of two people.

Luna.

Ellen.

Even if I never see them again in my life, I can't help but think of them when I look at the moon.

Ellen left, and it was inevitable.

It's more dangerous to be with me.

I know you left because you were thinking of me.

At some point, you'll forget.

Just pulling Ellen out of the hole she fell into to save me was already a miracle.

You have to push the boundaries of unfathomable possibilities and be satisfied that you succeeded in doing so.

Take another sip.

When I handed over the whiskey, a hot breath rose in my throat.

I can't remember the last time I had a drink.

Time will cover everything.

We're lucky enough as it is.

So there's no reason to think about people who aren't there.

You'll be doing something in your own space, and you'll still be feeling guilty, so you'll probably be out hunting monsters.

I'll try to do as much as I can without being seen.

He fumbled in his pocket and pulled out something.

A round, milky amulet.

An amulet with an engraved image of the moon and sun.

It was presumably made by grinding the bones of something.

Ellen took this off, and I picked this up.

Now this doesn't mean anything.

Whatever it actually did for Ellen, she's now free of that bondage.

To me, of course, it means nothing.

The next time you see Ellen, it won't be for a long time.

I guess I'll just have to let go of those regrets for the future.

Throw it out the window.

I'm going to put some force in my hand, and break it.

I thought about it for a while.

For a while.

For a while.

And so on for a while.

I'm laughing at myself for agonizing over it.

When you realize you've spent hours thinking about whether or not to throw something away.

I couldn't help but realize.

This is a meaningless object.

I can't even throw this away.

Oh dear, I can't even throw away a crappy amulet that has no value anymore.

"......Xfoot."

That it will never be possible to let go.

In the cold moonlight, I had a realization.

And so it goes, sip after sip, glass after glass.

Somewhere around the second, third, and fourth glasses.

-Smart

There was a knock at the door.

In the future, I'm going to hear the voice of an honor guard saying someone's here.

When I opened the door, there was a familiar face there.

"Should we now call you Your Majesty....... ?"

"Never mind."

It was Elise.



* * *



"Drinking on the eve of a wedding, that doesn't look good."

"Whatever."

"I guess so."

By the moonlit window, Elise and I sat across from each other.

"As you say, I've been looking for any trace of Antirrhinus......."

"Well, there you go."

"Yes."

Eleris followed my instructions and searched for signs of Antirrhinus.

The final fight in Diane.

Antirrhinus' whereabouts after that are unknown.

It's clear from the time and context that there was a battle after I was knocked out.

Maybe it was Luna.

But Luna said she wasn't going to help anymore, and she probably meant it.

But that doesn't mean it wasn't Luna. She might not have been willing to let me die for nothing.

After taking the souls, Antirrhinus fought with someone.

Then it disappeared. We don't even know if it's dead or not.

It's not that I don't have a good guess, but I'm not sure.

"Okay. I guess the fact that I'm alive is important."

And so would Ellen.

It was long.

It was a long, long time coming.

Meeting Charlotte in the castle of the Demon King.

Flee to the ecliptic.

From there, I wandered around in a daze.

Where the scribe's advice had led him, there was Elyse.

It started out as a demon castle, but it all started when I met Eleris.

Standing face to face with Elise on the night before the end of everything felt like some kind of destiny.

Eleris stays still at the table, staring out the window of the palace.

"I never thought I'd see something like this here."

"No, and I never wanted to."

"That's weird, it must be a very desirable seat for someone, and the last person you want to sit in it is......."

We looked at each other and laughed bitterly.

Eleris did not want war.

I didn't want a war either.

He wanted no throne, no rebuilding of the Darklands.

I told her to stop being a vassal of a fallen nation, and she was thrilled that I didn't want war.

But the two of us were the biggest culprits in all of this.

I was investigating a gate situation that wouldn't happen if I stood still.

Eleris spun up Akasha.

There was a war.

I found myself in a position I didn't ask for and didn't want.

If you didn't wish for a tragedy and it happened because of him, is it all his fault?

Don't be responsible.

Whose sin was it after all?

Me, the cause of it all?

Elise on Akasha herself?

Ellen and Charlotte, who didn't trust me and went behind my back rather than talk to me?

Bertus, who personally ordered my arrest?

Or Antirrhinus, who insisted that running Akasha was the answer?

I don't know.

Now, I don't even want to know.

It's just something you can't know until you think about it.

If you know.

If it becomes clear who is most at fault, so what?

It's not going to change anything.

However, the guilt is shared by all.

I'm not sure who's at fault, but they all say they are.

So they met their end.

I became an emperor.

Ellen is gone.

Charlotte will become regent of the new empire.

Bertus ran away.

"......."

Eleris was silent, and I took a shot of whiskey.

Everyone came to some sort of conclusion.

Everyone who was partially responsible for this has met their end.

But Eleris hasn't gotten any closure yet.

"Don't go."

"......."

But I can't help but wonder why he's here in the middle of the night, on the eve of my wedding.

It's clear that they want to leave.

Otherwise, he wouldn't look so sad.

"No, Your Majesty....... No, Your Majesty....... Um....... No."

Elise shakes her head.

"Bali."

If I leave, she is no longer my vassal.

So you don't have to serve me anymore.

"You, you don't need me anymore."

Then Elise says, with a sad look on her face.

At one point, Eleris' existence was absolute.

Without Eleris' help, my radius of action would be severely limited.

No, life would have been impossible.

When I needed magic, Elise was always there to help me.

But that role can now be filled by Herriot, or anyone who isn't Herriot.

"You know, I spent a long time in a place that has nothing to do with the Darklands."

"......."

"So, it's just a matter of going back."

In reality, Elise doesn't have to be by my side the whole time.

"And while few people know I'm the one who spun up Akasha, it can't hurt to have me by your side."

That's true, too.

After leaving Darklands, Eleris spent many years in places unrelated to it.

"So now, can we go back to....... Can I go back?"

She doesn't belong in the demonic realm in the first place.

She never intended to get this deeply involved in Darkland's work.

It was only a short stay.

But I've done more than I intended, I've played countless crucial roles, and I've committed sins of immeasurable depth.

So Eleris' choice to leave, even for my sake, is somewhat understandable.

You're not going back.

You want to do something about your guilt.

So you're going to try to find another harshness to push yourself to.

You're going to want to do something that's not out of character.

Just like Ellen chose to do.

"Eleris, she's a wreck."

"......Yes, I did."

Elise nods wistfully.

"If you hadn't believed me when I said you didn't want war, and had killed me then, none of this would have happened."

"......."

Yes.

If you killed me then.

None of this would have happened.

"If you were suspicious of what I was doing, didn't trust me, and killed me, none of this would have happened."

"......."

Elise continued to doubt whether she could trust me.

But, in the end, I couldn't put my hands on it. The first thing I told Elise was that I knew the future.

"And none of this would have happened if you hadn't fired up Akasha to save me."

"......."

Antony's proposal.

Sarkeesian pressure.

Eleris fired up Akasha, and the gate was open.

He didn't want to lose me.

Eleris said.

He wouldn't trade me for the world.

You said you hate war.

You said you hate fighting and death.

Over the course of our time together, she ended up valuing me more than anything else in the world.

Just like that.

Just like that.

It popped.

"While we're on the subject, do you want to be assertive at the end?"

"......."

At the verbal assault, Eleris hung her head in silence.

"No."

I shake my head.

"Don't go."

Elise struggles to lift her head and looks at me.

Elyse's eyes widen as she catches my gaze.

Because that would be me right now.

When she sees me like that, she can't help but feel the same way.

"Maybe I don't need you anymore, who knows."

There are many people who could replace Eleris.

There's Lucinil, there's the other road vampires, there's Herriot.

"You've gotten yourself into this mess because you've been busted."

"......."

Elise finally bursts into tears.

You can't replace someone with someone else.

A blank is a blank.

"How can anyone replace the part of my heart that Elise takes up, and that's something no one can do."

You can sit someone there, but while the gap may be filled, the loss is not.

"Don't go."

"......."

"I don't want Elise to be the last one to go, to be told not to go."

A loss is a loss.

You can fill a role, but you can't fill a heart.

"I can't afford to go twice when I don't have to."

It's not an accusation.

This is what happened because it collapsed.

All the way back to the end.

I hope this doesn't stop you from leaving.

At that dire statement, Eleris jumps to her feet.

"Okay. Okay......."

Then he gently pulled me into his arms.

"I'm not going. I'm sorry I....... hurt you more than......."

I thought I had hurt her, but she gave me a long, soothing hug.

The vampire's cold body temperature.

Cold, but always warm.

That's the way it is now, and that's the way it's always been.

This is what made me who I am today.

Without it, we couldn't even get started.

It's not a good ending, but it wasn't a good process either.

We made it to the end together.

You don't want to be torn apart for no reason.

Now that you've made it to the end.

I want to go beyond this with you.

I wondered if I had some kind of evil force that was holding him tightly, urging him not to leave.

Elise trembles, and speaks softly.



"My presence won't make much difference, but......."

"If it hurts to be without me......."

"If it hurts that much......."

"Yeah......."

"For the last time in this immortal life, I will watch you forever......."

It's been said that road vampires have an appetite.

"With that, I'll wrap it up."

Eleris, a long, long time of existence.

"I'll be with you forever."

It was as if I had decided when to put an end to what had been an unfathomably long day.

I pulled her into a face-to-face hug, thanking her for the promise of an eternity.

"Thank you, Elise."

I was grateful to hear that we would be together at the end of it all, just as we were at the beginning.



* * *



It was a wedding of epic proportions for the soon-to-be owners of a new continent.

It's not even a public wedding.

It's a mood, but it's also because luxury is impossible for a humanity on the brink of collapse.

As such, it was a wedding to which only the leaders and most powerful of humanity were invited.

The ecliptic will announce the fact of the marriage and the proclamation of the new empire.

So it's small, but it's small, and everyone is happy with it.

That said, the number of invitees was not small.

The leaders of each of the allied armies were present, as well as the kings and nobles who were still alive.

It doesn't hold a candle to the golden age of the empire, and compared to that, it's more like a small banquet at the imperial palace.

And, unsurprisingly, the look on their faces at the wedding was one of fear and anxiety rather than excitement.

Can this empire be trusted.

Can humanity ever be rebuilt?

Is it even right that reconstruction is in the hands of the devil?

Sensitive people already know.

Those who thought of rebelling against the New Empire did not come.

Of course, there will be those in attendance who will be rebellious and will be there as a means of exploration.

In the midst of all that mess, but with the music playing.

Holding the baton was Lanyon Sessor, the man who always cheered everyone up with music in the Alliance.

During the war, after the war.

You'll need music.

A band plays upbeat music, people come and go as they are directed.

Of course, nobility and royalty aren't the only ones in the room.

"Scarlet."

"Ah, Ivia."

Unsurprisingly, the redheaded Scarlett stood out quite a bit among the attendees.

"You look great in that dress. Where did you get it?"

"That....... Charlotte gave it to me. She said you'd need it."

Scarlett blushed at Ivia's envious glance.

Yvia, a telepath.

She was one of the unsung heroes of this war.

Ivia's telepathic abilities have greatly accelerated the speed of communication in the command center.

They're not the only heroes.

Among those who didn't fight, there are countless heroes.

There were many men from the Temple who were worthy of the title of war hero.

Ranion Cesordo playing music.

Ibiado, a telepath.

Adelia dines quietly with the Grand Duke of St. Thuan and his sons.

And the countless others who wouldn't be here today.

Every single one of them who died in the war deserved the title of hero.

Ivia says to Scarlett, "Hold still," pointing to Lannion Sesor, who conducts the band.

"Lanyon is going to be a bard."

"Bard......?"

"Yes."

Lanyon Sesor also deserves a lot of credit.

So he could sit in the court musicians of the imperial palace, and there would still be plenty of people with money to hire Lanyon.

But to be a bard wandering the continents.

Around this time, too.

"He said he's been singing about what he's seen and heard from the Allies, and I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think he wants to tell the truth."

How hard that fight was.

How tragic.

How heroic, though.

Scarlett nodded at the thought of traveling the world singing a song like that.

"I'm still not sure, I think my ability to....... I don't think it matters much anymore."

Faster communication.

It was a much-needed skill for the army, but now that the Alliance was disbanded, Ivia didn't know what she was going to do.

Now that the war is over, you are responsible for your own livelihood.

No empire is so rich that it can afford to give its war heroes a place to sleep and eat forever.

After all, the new emperor's orders are harsh: eat well and live well.

You've done a good job so far, now you're on your own.

Maybe later we can give something to war veterans, but for now it's hard.

Because everyone is starving.

Ivia, for her part, seemed to be at a loss as to how to make a living in the immediate future, even after attending the Emperor's wedding.

"Scarlett, have you thought about what you're going to do?"

"umm......."

Scarlett bit her lip slightly at Ivia's question.

"I'll probably end up doing an article."

"A knight? Scarlett's a good one, I suppose. If it's a knight, is it here?"

Ivia points to the floor of the ballroom, the imperial palace.

"Yes, perhaps....... the Emperor's escort to....... I think."

"......really?"

Ivia couldn't help but gape.

Some people have come face-to-face with the Devil, while others in their class are vaguely afraid of him. Like Ivia.

This is especially true for those who weren't even close to Reinhardt when he lived under his name.

Scarlett becomes the Emperor's bodyguard.

"Charlotte said....... You said that my strength is in my ability to protect....... and she asked me if I'd like to be in that position, so I agreed......."

That was Charlotte's suggestion.

In the case of Immortals, Scarlet's abilities were specifically used for destruction and incapacitation.

But Scarlet's powers are actually specialized for protecting things.

With a knight by his side who can neutralize all magic and superpowers, the emperor's safety is assured in any situation.

"Of course....... although I suspect you'll be seeing more of my protected ugliness......."

But Scarlett was pretty sure that even if she had superpowers, she would hardly be able to protect herself from a demon that was incomparably stronger than she was.

In fact, I even had an ominous thought that if there was a crisis, the devil would risk his life to protect them.

Scarlett was almost convinced by the thought.

And just like that, there were a lot of people in the ballroom, just as Ivia and Scarlett were staring at the ballroom where the wedding was taking place.

Among them were the Grand Duke of Saint-Antoine and his family, dining at one of the tables.

"Wow....... It's hard to put into words."

"I see."

Watching your favorite youngest get married.

But it's a joint wedding.

The devil marries with five brides, and the youngest is one of them.

As they ate, Adelia still couldn't quite wrap her head around the fact that in many ways, that's what Herriot had become.

I met him the other day and we talked for a while, but it was still the same.

The Archduchess was sobbing incoherently, and the Archduke couldn't bring himself to reprimand her.

I can't help it, it's a bit of a mess.

And in the corner of the table sat Heinrich von Schwarz, his mouth hanging open in disbelief.

Around him sat Erich, Kai, Kono Lindt, and Klippmann, all with the exact same expression on their faces as Heinrich.

Everyone is frozen.

-Celebrate. What is this? Yeah, uh....... No, your sister is gonna be so happy to see you do this.

-pakpak!

-.......

And Liana de Granz was giggling and slapping Heinrich on the back.

-Da, shut up Riana.......

-Eup! Eup!

Only the gentle Cliff could force Riana's mouth shut.

Heinrich and his friends were stunned, unable to comprehend the horror of the situation.

Soon.

The wedding has begun.

All attendees stood up from their seats.

The devil and his brides all stood up at once.

Centered on the Devil.

The closest, on the right, was Herriot de Saint-Ouen.

There were no complicated procedures, no lengthy ceremonies, no long speeches, no moments of the new emperor ranting about his vision of a new empire.

Louise von Schwarz, Herriot de Saint-Étienne, Mawang, Charlotte de Gradias, Olivia Ranze, Airi.

Five side-by-side demons, each wearing a colorful dress, stand still.

"For those who know me, I hate long-windedness."

"I don't expect anyone to come this far and not know who's getting married, so I'll skip the explanation."

"I'm getting married."

"Also, today is not only a wedding day, but also a day to proclaim a new empire."

"As of this hour, I proclaim a new empire."

"I've announced my marriage, I've announced my empire, I've done everything I'm supposed to do."

"It's a poor time for everyone, so it's unseemly to eat and talk long."

"Thank you for your time."

"Because I have a lot of work to do, and so do you."

"I don't want to hold on to it for long."

"So eat in moderation, drink in moderation, and go home in moderation."

"I don't like anything long anymore."

"The war and the dissension have been too long."

"So from now on, let's keep things short."

"Okay, let's get this over with and get it done."

Everyone froze in their tracks at that bold statement.

No formality.

Rude.

No procedures.

Blind.

Is this the new empire.

Marry.

It's a new empire.

Two words and it was all over.

So that's what it means to be the new emperor, the new ruler of the continent.

Is this domination really right?

But no matter what anyone thought, a new reign had begun.

Whatever.

The Emperor says he will.
