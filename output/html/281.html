            Episode 281.





Ludwig is no slouch either, and he's grown a lot since the first semester, even compared to the original.

Saviolin Tana crossed swords with Ludwig five times in a row. Unsurprisingly, she was subdued in a single blow.

Due to her level, she did not use any magical enhancements and defeated him solely through skill.

Certainly, it wasn't like Ellen.

With the least amount of motion necessary, she brought her sword to her side, not allowing Ludwig an inch of space.

It doesn't even look like he's using much force. He grips his training sword with his right hand and gives it a slight flick, but the sword is pushed back and his trajectory is disrupted.

Right now, Saviolin Tana is unbeatable in the melee division. So she's going to have a tough time with Ellen, and Olivia Ranze is going to have a tough time with her.

You said there's a sky above the sky.

If me and Ludwig were on the ground, Ellen would be in the stratosphere, and Xavier Tana would be on the moon.

Or maybe a different planet altogether, because he can summon an Auror Sword without a sword.

Overwhelming walls.

Ludwig scratched his head, searching for any hint of self-pity or futility at being so futilely defeated.

"You say you practice a lot, but you're falling far short, Lord Tana."

"Call me sir. I'm not here as a knight."

"Yes, sir!"

"......."

Saviolin Tana asked Ludwig to strike a pose with his sword.

"Ludwig, you have a very shallow understanding of the sword. You have learned it mechanically. You know the blade, but you don't know why you need it. You don't understand, so you exert too much force. Swordsmanship, by definition, does not require excessive force. You need a more in-depth understanding of the technique, as all universal swordsmanship theories are based on not using magical enhancements."

"Yes, sir!"

"If you want to know more, come and ask. Over. Next."

The overbearing Ludwig steps aside, and this time it's Delphine.

"Name?"

"This is Delphine Isadra....... Thank you."

Delphine Isadra, who was always on the cheerful side, if not quite as cheerful as Ludwig, was nervous. That's how it's supposed to be in front of a man of his stature.

It's like having Einstein in your science class. They're there to see how you study and give you advice.

It's weird that Ludwig isn't nervous.

Delphine stabbed at Tana with her training blade. Tana did the same this time, thrusting her own sword at an angle to the tip of Delphine's thrusting blade, twisting the blade's hilt.

"Ahem!"

Delphine lost control of the sword and ended up flipping over her wrist.

"Hmm."

Tana blushed and shook her head as she watched Delphine pick up her training sword.

"You're not a swordsman."

"Oh, that....... Yeah."

"Archery?"

"What? Ah....... How......."

"If I had a callus like that between my thumb and index finger, that would be it."

At Tana's words, Delphine froze and stared at her. Tana seemed to see it, the natural calluses she'd developed from handling the bowstring so casually.

"I don't think I have anything to teach you. Next."

Tana turned to Delphine to see if she could offer any advice on archery. Delphine blushed with embarrassment and backed away as if to run away.

No, but you can still say a few words, can't you? You're relentless.

Next up was Scarlet.

Scarlett pursed her lips nervously.

"This is Scarlett....... Thank you."

"Come on."

"Yes."

Scarlett seemed more inclined to play a slow, exploratory game than to point her dueling blades at Tana.

It sees an opening and tries to get in.

Scarlett's skills are the best of any of us here, pure and simple. I'm not so much a swordsman as I am compensated for a number of conditions.

"If you don't come, we'll go this way."

As Tana took a step forward, Scarlet took a step back, her sword pointed forward. As if she would be completely subdued the moment the sword touched.

Tana wasn't in a hurry. For every step she took, Scarlett took a step back.

But you can't stay on the sidelines forever.

Tana's sword was not that fast. In fact, it goes in so slowly that you wonder if it's intentionally slow.

Of course, that's not going to happen in real life.

As if it were a problem.

What would you do if I went into a sword path like this?" With that feeling, he slashed his sword honestly at Scarlett, from top to bottom.

Scarlet has seen that the moment she touches that sword, she is caught in its path and either swept away or bounces off.

Scarlett's choice was evasion.

The moment you try to dodge by stepping slightly to the side of the sword.

"!"

Tana saber-raises and draws her sword toward her body, converting it into a straight stab.

It was close to the same time.

As if it knew in advance that Scarlett was about to make an evasive judgment call, the moment her body moved, it was already transformed into a stab of Savior Tana's sword.

But it's not impossible to deal with.

Scarlet thrusts her training blade toward the path of Saviolin Tana's stab.

The sword is oriented so that the scarlet is further inward.

If we continue to push, Tana's sword will be pushed into an outward trajectory instead of toward Scarlett's body.

This way, Scarlet can stab Tana, but Tana's sword will miss.

But Scarlett's thrusts and pushes are just as scary as Tana's sword.

-Whoosh!

With a flick of her wrist, she flipped the sword backwards.

Quickly claiming the inside, he easily pushed aside Scarlett's dueling blades and aimed the blade at the nape of her neck.

At face value, it's a sum.

As far as the action before that goes, it was just two sums.

"Hmmm. Not bad."

Saviolin Tana nodded, more in recognition of Scarlett's judgment and quickness than the number of times.

"......Thank you."

Scarlett didn't seem to understand why she was being told she was fine when she lost by only two moves.

Since then, Tana has babysat Scarlett four more times.

Of course, it wasn't much different than before.

The only difference is that, like Ludwig, he doesn't rely on brute strength, but on psychological warfare, using his wits to figure out the best way out of a tight situation.

Saviolin Tana seemed to see that in Scarlett.

"You're a good student, keep going."

"Go, thank you......."

"Next."

Saviolin Tana would just say that and move on.

I mean, shouldn't I be teaching her something? Of course, Scarlett is no match for me in terms of pure swordsmanship.

But the look on Scarlett's face suggests that she didn't need the feedback.

His face is wide open, and I can see that he's feeling pretty excited.

I could see Ludwig and Delphine's envy, and Erich could barely look at Scarlett.

The best prosecutor on the continent said it was excellent.

There's nothing more motivating to a sword practitioner than that.

Some people are so strong and powerful that they can change the lives of others with just a few words. Saviolin Tana is one of those people.

Scarlett will use this as motivation to work harder now.

At that point, I don't need to teach you anything in detail, it's just me and Erich de Lapaeri.

Erich hesitated.

"Get out."

"Uh, uh......? Me?"

Scarlett is up next. I'm sure Erich knows that he doesn't compare favorably to Scarlett. So he doesn't want to go out and be compared to her.

Yeah, why are you here?

The name Saviolin Tana is enough to get Erich excited.

Erich looks like he doesn't want to be embarrassed right now.

"Why don't you go to ...... or something?"

"Oh, no!"

-Enough!

If the cub doesn't leave now, it's the last one.

I may not be as good as Scarlett right now, but I'm sure I'll be better overall.

"That would be Erich de Lapaeri, first year Royal Class, A-9."

"Class A?"

"Yes."

"......."

Tana stares at Erhi, the tip of her dueling sword tucked into the floor of the training hall.

'Hmm....... He's cool.'

'You're not even good enough to pretend.......'

"This kid is Royal Class?

"Is this all there is to royal class anymore?

"No, he was fine earlier.

"What is it?

'um.......'

'I don't think I'm going to be able to say anything good about him.......'

A million thoughts rush through Saviolin Tana's expressionless face.

"......You don't need to see it."

"That....... Yes?"

"I don't want to embarrass you. You don't do it."

Saviolin Tana said, as if she knew Erich as soon as she saw him.

There.......

Wouldn't it be more embarrassing to hear that.......

"Next."

Saviolin Tana looks at me this time.

Last turn.

"This is Reinhardt."

"Yeah."

I raised my water sword.

Saviolin Tana and I are officially old friends. We met face-to-face at the Royal Class sponsorship and got sponsored.

But there is no relationship after that. What happened at the Palace of Spring is top secret, so Saviolin Tana is not really an acquaintance of mine, although I am acquainted with her.

So....... This is kind of weird.

"Good, good. You're inferring a sword path from your opponent's shoulders and stride, which is a difficult sensation to develop. But you're not quite there yet. But don't worry. It's just inexperience, and it will come naturally as you continue to train and study."

"Okay, but a little more, like this. A little more strength in your hands, and....... A little more. A little harder. Oh, I'm not that strong yet. Mmm. Okay. Yeah, you can do that. You're still young."

"Great. I can't believe I can do this already, but this would have been better. Look. Like this. Do you know what that feels like?"

"No, no. Not like that. Like this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. You're a fast learner."

"Some more, some more, no, one more time. Mmm. It's getting better. Let's do it one more time."

This person.

He's got me, and he keeps doing this.

No.......

Why are you playing favorites!

I finally understood why Saviolin Tana had offered to teach the children swordplay.

I can see why the other guys said a few words and moved on.

This guy was trying to teach me something.

"Okay, okay, Reinhardt. Excellent."

All the other kids stared at the scene of overwhelming favoritism.
