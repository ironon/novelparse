            Episode 345.





On the day he was discovered cross-dressing, he gave important instructions about creating a coalition of anti-Imperial forces.

I wonder what the hell he's doing.

I don't feel like there's too much of a temperature difference between what I do as Reinhardt and what I do as Valerie.

Along the way, he awakened to his higher talent of magic domination.

I also developed a sense of crisis, that the things I'd been doing were a butterfly effect that could catch up with me at any moment.

I felt like I was treading on thin ice when I realized that my participation in a cross-dressing contest had led to Bertus doing a background check on me.

And when will Ellen be back.

That night.

My body was tired from training, but I couldn't fall asleep because I had so many things on my mind.

How long has it been since I tossed and turned for hours, barely falling asleep.

-cook

-Reinhard....... Reinhard.......

"Ugh!"

I was jolted awake by an urgent hand grasping mine.

As I lifted myself out of bed, I saw Charlotte lying on her back, almost face down, clutching my arm.

"Sh....... Charlotte?"

"Rhein....... Reinhard......."

Half of Charlotte's face was shrouded in darkness as she stared at me, sobbing.

More than shocked and amazed, I was scared out of my mind.

I thought it had gone quiet.

We weren't quite done yet.

"Me, how....... I need to know how....... How about......."

"Uh, uh, ah, okay."

Not knowing what to do, I picked up Charlotte, who was squirming and screaming.

"It's okay. It's all good......."

"ugh, ugh......."

Charlotte squirmed in my arms, tears streaming down her face.

I thought I was done, but apparently not.

I'm awake and alert. Eagerly, as if reciting a prayer.

"You'll be fine."

Charlotte's power was not lost.

"Nothing will happen."

Unless this power is destroyed, Charlotte will live in this pain forever.

I patted Charlotte's back again and again, whispering that it would be okay.

Words.

It must have worked, because Charlotte's trembling subsided, and the darkness that seemed to have consumed her gradually subsided.

Is this really responding to the power of words?

That's what Charlotte understands, and that's what Saviolin Tana understands.

But I couldn't tell if it was responding to my power of demonic domination, or to a spirit, or to something else entirely.

However.

"Hmph....... Black....... Ugh......."

It seemed clear that I was the only one who could make Charlotte's condition better.

As the tremors gradually subsided and Charlotte returned to her normal self, I recognized her.

Barefoot in a camisole.

I was soaked in a cold sweat that it was embarrassing to look at.

Charlotte couldn't get out of my arms.

"......."

"......."

You're feeling better, and you can't help but think about what you look like.

I carefully pulled the blanket down and draped it over Charlotte's shoulders.

"Are you feeling better?"

"ugh, ugh......."

In the darkness, Charlotte nodded as she wrapped the quilt I'd given her around her like a cloak. I picked her up from the floor and gently placed her on the bed.

My visit was closed. I checked the lock and it was locked.

How did it get in?

"What happened?"

"......I didn't lose consciousness this time, but it just happened."

They used to be taken from you while you were unconscious or asleep.

But this time, while I was awake, the shadows began to creep in.

"I need to get to you, but if I go out into the hallway....... in case someone sees you......."

Charlotte shuddered, afraid she'd done it.

Once upon a time, when you were completely in the shadows.

It was as if he had traveled straight from his room to mine, using the power of shadows or darkness to move.

"I don't want to do this....... I don't want to do this....... I don't want to be able to do this......."

Charlotte was eventually able to use her powers to come to me unnoticed, but the mere fact that it was possible seemed to terrify the hell out of her.

I felt like my fear was clouding my judgment.

"Stay with me....... Stay with me, Reinhard......."

"Okay, I'll stay with you."

Charlotte clings to my waist, looking up at me in the darkness.

His eyes were wide with fear, tears pooling in his eyes.

I thought it was dangerous.

Charlotte was unstable, and just when she thought she was safe, this happened again, and she was on the verge of falling apart again.

"Together....... Continue with......."

Charlotte's lips were about to part slightly.

"It's okay."

I tugged Charlotte's head toward my chest.

"It's okay, don't be scared."

"......."

I felt like something irreversible was going to happen. I had no choice but to do it.

"Nothing's going to happen, obviously."

Charlotte stayed still in my arms for a very long time.



* * *



As the horror wore off, Charlotte passed out and fell asleep.

I guarded Charlotte's bedside, as I had done in the palace last spring.

How long has it been since Charlotte fell asleep.

-Bang!

A sudden, urgent pounding on the door causes your entire body to stiffen.

-Reinhardt, Nada.

The sound of voices on the other side of the door broke the tension.

Saviolin Tanada.

Cautiously, I rose from my seat and opened the door, and there stood a pale, fed-up-looking Savior Tana.

-delay

"Reinhard, do you happen to know if His Majesty is here....... here."

She breathed a sigh of relief when she saw Charlotte lying on the bed through the doorway.

She straightened up and walked into my room, gently placing her hand on Charlotte's sleeping forehead.

"You suddenly disappeared, so I went to....... just in case."

Saviolin Tana was at the Temple to serve as Charlotte's bodyguard.

Even though you don't share Charlotte's bedroom, you've probably checked in on her periodically to make sure she's sleeping well.

Suddenly, Charlotte disappeared, and I realized that she was looking for me, just in case. Charlotte was fast asleep.

"I don't think I've been knocked unconscious this time, but I think I've had a sudden burst of power, and I've been riding the shadows to my room."

"Is that......."

You're not losing consciousness, but you're losing control of your power.

Savior Tana and I can't help but realize that Charlotte's condition isn't completely healed.

Tana stared down at the sleeping Charlotte with a distressed expression on her face.

"That you could somehow calm His Highness's condition....... I'm afraid."

She seemed to think that my presence was, in and of itself, a great relief to Charlotte.

"But restraining the power of electric charges in this imperfect way will always be....... only a stopgap measure."

It is unclear how long I will be able to stabilize Charlotte's condition.

We need to find a more fundamental solution, Saviolin Tana seemed to think so, and I think so too.

But where is such a thing.

Finding a sealer is a thing of the past.

I couldn't help but think about it eventually.

Akasha.

I don't like to think of it as a one-size-fits-all tool that can fulfill any wish, but that's where my mind went for now.

I wonder if there's a way to seal Charlotte's power in there.

Saviolin Tana says, carefully wiping the cold sweat from Charlotte's forehead with a handkerchief as she sleeps.

"Reinhardt."

"Yes."

"It's clear that the power of ...... is tied to the Devil. You know that."

"It's ......."

I'm the only one who knows that.

"Is it a leap of faith to think that the clue to solving the king's condition might be in the Demon King's Castle?"

Saviolin Tana's melancholy tone was mingled with her own misery at being unable to offer any help to the suffering Empress.

However, Demonstration.

Not a nostalgic place, but a place to start.

I still don't know what's in there.

"......I don't know, didn't we already get everything we could get from Demon Castle?"

"Yes, but Demon Castle is a very important place in the Darklands' history, which is almost as long as humanity's. We probably haven't discovered everything yet."

There are things on the planet that we have yet to discover. So even though we've taken out treasure and other things, there are still things that are hidden, and we're still investigating them.

As I listened to her, I realized that it's one thing to know that Demon Castle has fallen, but it's another thing to know all of it.

All I'm doing is suppressing Charlotte's power with the transcendent power of a spirit. I'm not even sure if it's really a spirit power.

I agree with her that a more fundamental solution is needed.

Is there a clue in the castle?

"Are you trying to go to the Demon Castle?"

"I don't have to go to ......, they already have tons of people searching for it."

You don't have to go there yourself. It's not like she has so few people to call on that she has to do it herself.

"Your Majesty is....... that you should travel to the city of Demon King yourself....... himself. It's obviously dangerous. It's dangerous, and I've always opposed it. Me, too, Your Majesty."

She looks at me with her hand on Charlotte's forehead.

Charlotte knew she wasn't whole, so she traveled to the Demon Castle, thinking it might hold answers.

Tana would have argued against it, of course, because it could be dangerous.

But today, Charlotte's powers have struck again. Savior Tana bows her head in front of Charlotte's sleeping face and speaks in a grim voice.

"Reinhard, may I ask you a difficult favor?"

I didn't have to listen to her to know what she was going to say.

"I'll come with you."

"......."

I knew that if anything happened to Charlotte's powers, I'd be the only one who could handle it, so I knew it would be about going to the Demon Castle with her.

At my answer, given without hearing what I was about to ask, her shoulders shook as she held Charlotte's sleeping hand still.

"Thank you....... Reinhardt."

I think it's the right thing to do.

Was this what the Emperor was talking about, what I needed to do for Charlotte?



* * *



The next day.

Feeling refreshed, Charlotte returned to her room with the help of Saviolin Tana, and rejoined me, properly washed and ready.

"Ma Wangsheng......? You too?"

"Yeah."

Charlotte looked apologetic, as if Tana had already explained everything.

"......might be dangerous."

"How dangerous can a demonized demon castle be?"

I feel absolutely no guilt in saying this.

To me, the devil is just an asshole.

We'll need the Emperor's permission, but we'll be able to go to the Demon City.

I don't know about you, Charlotte, but we once escaped the Demon Castle together, and we're going back together.

It's giving me a weird thrill.

Charlotte looked at me with a complicated expression. She'd lost her cool yesterday, clinging to me and crying, and now she'd offered to accompany me to the Demon King Castle.

The look on Charlotte's face was a complex mix of embarrassment, gratitude, and guilt.

"Thank you. Really."

You say you always receive.

So, I can give you anything I can give you.

Charlotte added with a blush.



* * *



No immediate departure for the city of Demon King. Saviolin Tana had gone to the Emperor for permission, so she would need some time. At least a few days, at least.

I did what I had to do.

I left the Temple and headed to the Rotary Club.

"Is it worth it?"

"Yeah, they're all nice."

Adriana beamed at my question.

Somehow, Loyar had become like Adriana's dog, and the other club members seemed to like him so much that they naturally took care of him.

I wasn't without my concerns, but it's a good thing the rest of the club was looking favorably on Adriana, as Loyar was easily taken down.

Adriana is a diligent worker, and she seemed to be helping out with various chores at the club headquarters.

So it was no mistake that everyone felt a little cleaner than before.

While I was there, Adriana and I walked around the Rotary Club neighborhood.

What's going through Adriana's mind?

I've been hurt by a lot of things, and now I'm in hiding.

"What about you?"

Still, Adriana seemed more concerned about Olivia than herself.

"Well....... His personality has changed a bit, but he seems to be handling it well."

"Yeah....... Good."

I had a future, but I gave it up, and when I came back and tried to get my life back, it was taken away from me.

Adriana will be vague and vain.

You won't know what to do next.

Just as Olivia became disillusioned with religion, she became disillusioned with people.

Is Adriana walking through the steps before that?

"Those who were taught to love terrified me, and those who were taught to hate all their lives saved me."

It must feel like everything she's ever believed in has been denied. Though she keeps quiet here, I'm sure these thoughts are haunting her.

In fact, had she returned to the temple or entered the monastery, she would have been summoned immediately to investigate what had happened.

And it would be fatal if it became known that he had been rescued by demons.

Even now, she is unknowingly protected by demons.

By me and Loyar.

"What am I supposed to live for. I'm not sure anymore."

Adriana looked up at the deep blue winter sky and smiled sadly.

Forced to learn a truth she didn't want to know, Adriana was lost.



* * *



Prince of the Demon Realm and heir to the Darklands, but I do not know what is in the Demon Castle.

But I'm not going to go looking for it just because I don't know.

I don't know, but I'm sure there are guys who do.

After a short walk with Adriana, I called Loyar outside.

"How long have you been off the council, and where else are you going?"

"Uh."

You're talking like you're going to keep running around when your lord's work is done.

"I'm thinking of going back to Mawang Castle."

"Are you talking about....... You mean?"

At the mention of a demonic castle, Loyaar's face fell.

"You know, I've lost my memory, so I don't know what's in the Demon Castle, so I was wondering if there's a secret room in the Demon Castle, somewhere the humans couldn't rob."

At my words, Loyar shook his head.

"......How do I know that?"

"Weren't you at the Demon Castle? You said I harassed you before."

"......."

At my words, Loyar glares at me with a fatalistic look. Does he have PTSD or something?

"Lowly, there's no way I, who am neither a noble nor royalty of the Darklands, could know such a thing. I don't know if there is such a thing."

"......Yes."

Because I've lost my memory, I originally asked Loyar what I needed to know. Of course, Loyar would know nothing of the sort.

"So you don't know Elise or Sarkegar?"

"Wouldn't that be more likely?"

It's the sort of thing only royalty knows about.

You could go there like you're headed to the ground, but there's no reason to.

The royalty of the Darklands, except for me, who has lost his memory.

There is one.

"Does Airi know anything?"

"Wouldn't that be more likely?"

Watch me say the same thing I just said.

You don't want to deal with me?

Despite the inconvenience of traveling to the Edina Archipelago to ask, it was important to have the right information. Better to be safe than sorry.

It's been a while since our first meeting with Airi, so we need to know how she's doing.

However, the warp gate does not reach the Edina Archipelago.

So unless you're traveling with a wizard who can teleport, you'll have to travel by boat, which can take a very long time.

But with Lucinil's help, I won't have to go away for a few days.

Return of the Demon King.

And what might still be left of the Demon Castle.

I wonder if Airi knows about them.
