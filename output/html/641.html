It wasn't long before Scarlett was back on the ecliptic.

With a large warp spot in operation at all times for resupply, Scarlet was able to return to the ecliptic in no time at all, scared to get permission.

It's a huge distance, but a single mass teleport cast by several archmages could bring supplies and people back and forth at any time.

While some had returned to the ecliptic for the winter, this was Scarlet's first time back at the Temple since joining the Alliance.

In fact, those who were able to fight in the temple were rarely back in the temple, as they were almost always on the battlefield.

"Whoa......."

-Hair

After returning and showering, Scarlett collapsed onto her bed in a heap.

Scarlett realized that the end of the gate crisis was not far off.

The sense of urgency grew.

There's always the question of whether she'll make it to the end of it all. Scarlett is stronger than most, but she's also been close to death many times.

As such, there was no certainty that it would survive to the end.

But it all came to an abrupt end.

No one is injured, and the gate debacle is not over.

Because your ability is dangerous to your allies.

So I didn't know if being on the battlefield would be a problem.

"......."

Sprawled out on the bed, Scarlett lay there, dead as a doornail.

It had been done before, but Scarlet knew that the Alliance wouldn't be in much trouble without her.

There are Titans, and there are weird armies that I can't quite put my finger on.

Is this the end of the fight?

There's still a lot of unfinished business, but does fighting unidentified monsters now wrap up a paragraph?

Scarlett knew it would all end somehow, either in death or survival.

But no.

Scarlett was, to put it mildly, frozen, as she hadn't expected her fight to end this way.

It doesn't feel real.

Suddenly, without any real foreshadowing.

You can take a break now.

And the words.

From Anna.

What was that story about never telling Christina?

What it meant.

At first, Anna looked so desperate in her eyes that Scarlett did as she was told, but she couldn't help but feel uncomfortable.

By trusting Anna, you're saying that you didn't trust Christina after all.

If I ever get around to it, I'll ask.

Because it could have been nothing.

Scarlett is lying on her bed when she suddenly realizes something.

The smell of a fluffy comforter is all too familiar.

After being outside for so long, the dorm bed, the blankets, and the view of the room were all so unfamiliar.

The days of begging on the streets seemed like a distant memory.

The war has consumed everything, and everything before it has faded into obscurity.

Everything feels like the distant past, and everything that was once familiar is unfamiliar.

I couldn't live outside of the temple, so I tried to cling to it.

But now Scarlett is free to live outside the Temple.

Even when the war is over, there will still be monsters left on the continent.

Wherever a sword is needed, Scarlett has a use. And everywhere the world needs a sword. Scarlett can now live without the Temple.

Scarlett pushes herself out of bed and stares at this familiar yet unfamiliar landscape.

The second floor of the Temple Royal Class dormitory.

It's summer and the landscape is green.

Can the temple be restarted?

Too many people have died, and too many of them are students.

Scarlett was supposed to be in fifth grade.

But everything stops at second grade.

No dorms, no education, no landscapes.

Everything is frozen and not flowing.

"......."

Will humanity ever regain its original serenity?

Suddenly, Scarlett realized that it was all a bit much.

It would be next to impossible to get the temple up and running again.

However, even if the temple is up and running again.

Friends who are already gone are not coming back, no matter what.

Ashur.

Delphi.

There's no coming back from that.

Even if, miraculously, Temple were to start teaching again, their empty seats would be empty forever.

Even if peace were to return to the world, the countless voids left by such people would never be filled.

Scarlett finally bites her lip and begins to cry a little.

Scarlett buried her face between her knees and cried for a long time, remembering the face of Delphine, who had died in her place.

I wonder if I should live.

Scarlett could somewhat understand Ludwig's feeling of being forced back from the battlefield.

I don't think this is the end of the story.

I think there's something more we can do.

How Ludwig eventually returned to the battlefield with a bandage around his arm, claiming that rear support was all he needed.

I could kind of see where he was coming from.

It's disturbing that we're back here, no matter how good the reason, when others are still risking their lives.

Scarlett, however, is a very different case than Ludwig.

Ludwig is without power, but Scarlett is, and that's a problem.

Ludwig had even more reason to retreat from the battlefield.

Scarlett knows best that she can't help herself.

But just like Ludwig, Scarlett was not one to sag and say, "I don't have to fight anymore.

It's disturbing and uncomfortable for some reason.

Scarlett stares at her hands.

Think about your superpower.

What a bunch of useless abilities.

Actually, it's not technically a useless ability.

Ever since the monsters started using their strange powers, Scarlett's abilities have had a place.

However, the number of monsters with magical-like powers is small among all the different types of monsters. They are often accompanied by overwhelming physical power, so they don't mean much.

So psychic powers were a tool, but I couldn't rely on them alone.

It's even gotten to the point where it breaks magical equipment that touches the wake of his abilities.

It's a problem because it's so advanced.

The good news is that you can consciously control it.

It's a good thing there's no magic at all, or the teleportation spell wouldn't work.

At that level, I would have had to walk all the way across the ecliptic and back by myself.

It's a superpower that doesn't do much for the enemy, but rather disables friendly golems and magical equipment.

If it were a human vs. human fight, Scarlett knows her powers would help tremendously.

Enemy mages won't even be able to get a raw hit on Scarlett.

But it's a fight against monsters, so it doesn't really matter.

Of course, that's not the kind of fight Scarlett wants to have.

It's useless, but useless is a good thing.

The power to neutralize magic and superpowers.

Scarlett smiles a bitter smile of her own.

Funny how I was ostracized as a child for being a witch.

In fact, you're probably the furthest thing from a witch.

I don't know how to do magic, and magic doesn't work.

I was teased because I had red hair and red eyes, and it made all those years of bullying seem funny and bittersweet.

Eventually, Scarlett left the battlefield.

It's a bitter pill to swallow that your abilities are actually harming your allies, but on reflection, I can't help it.

'Yes.......'

Scarlett thinks for a moment.

'For someone like me, being useless is a good thing.......'

Depending on how you look at it, this is a powerful ability, but one that is better left unused.

Such power.

So I want to come back and wait for the war to end, and I want to see a world where people can live in peace, even if things can't go back to the way they were.

You just have to hope for it.

With that in mind, I thought I'd take a deep sleep for the first time in a very long time.

-Angel

"......?"

Scarlett cocked her head at the sound beyond the window.

Obviously.

It was a cat crying.

"What is it?

The sound of a cat meowing.

Out the window.

It was a cat sitting on the window sill outside Scarlett's dorm room window, crying.

Scarlett knew the cat.

The cat is crying as she looks out the window at herself.

"Ah."

Suddenly, Scarlett remembers who she had forgotten.

Apparently, Ellen had gone back to the ecliptic briefly because she forgot her cat in her dorm.

After that, Ellen rarely came out of her barracks, so we didn't have much to talk about, but it was clear that she had left her cat behind.

So, that black cat has probably been living in the dorm ever since.

-Angel

-TalkTalk

The cat taps a fern-like paw on the window.

As in, open.

Ellen has a cat.

And I got to see Ellen take him back. I saw him pacing around in his cage.

It's not weird to have a cat.

-Angel

-TalkTalk

But something strange.

"I'm on the second floor here......?"

This is the second floor of the dormitory.

And since they tend to be taller than normal buildings, a two-story dorm is much taller than the second floor of a normal building.

How in the world could a cat be up there?

Scarlett couldn't help but look at the cat and panic.

Anyway.

I don't know how he got up there, but it would be a shame if he jumped down and hurt himself.

Couldn't that be the case a lot of the time?

It's one of those things where you go up because you can, but you don't know how to get down.

But that cat.

I've seen him since he was a kitten, but why hasn't he grown up at all?

Is it a slow-growing variety?

Scarlett opened the window cautiously, not wanting to take any chances.

-Dalcock

With sound.

Fold.

and the cat jumps into Scarlett's room.

However.

-Thump!

While.

"......!"

The cat walked into Scarlett's room and took on the form of a human.

"Oh......?"

It's called being human.

If you're too surprised, you'll end up sounding like an idiot.

Nothing comes out of my mouth.

"....... a......? a......."

I was so surprised.

Scary.

Also, to my horror.

While Scarlett is speechless.

"Let me ask you a quick question. I'm in a hurry."

Humanized.

"You, before you got here. I mean, from yesterday to now."

A cat, in the guise of Reinhardt to be exact, asks.

"Christina."

"Louis Ankton."

"Anna de Guerna."

"Ludwig."

Where did the cute cat go, Reinhardt, looking seriously stern.

That foul-mouthed Reinhardt.

"Have you ever met any of these four people?"

I didn't even bother to explain it.

Beyond the obvious answer, Scarlett was not in a position to think.

-Hair

"a....... ah....... ah......."

Scarlett couldn't say anything, and she just stood there, frozen in place.

"Help, help....... Help me......."

Reinhardt's brow narrowed as he looked at Scarlett, who seemed to understand why.

"Hey, I don't know about you, but I'm in a goddamn hurry. Now!"

Urgent is urgent.

Still, they didn't explain.

But as he stared down at Scarlet, the demon's complexion turned grim.

Obviously, there was no sign of anger, which would have made him look angry.

"If you can't answer that quickly, at least put some clothes on!"

"!!!!!"

On top of that, Scarlett had just gotten out of the shower and into bed, so she was still in her underwear.



* * *



Scarlett nearly fainted.

The world's accomplishment in breaking into Scarlett's room was to turn red in the face and tell her to get dressed if she couldn't answer his questions, so she shivered and got dressed.

You're in someone's room without permission, and you're giving them orders.

The devil is an asshole.

Scarlett cowered in the corner of the room, shaking, not from embarrassment, but from bewilderment at what was happening in front of her.

What's a cat.

The Devil.

What the question is.

So far, what and how.

If the cat is actually a demon.

What's going on up until now?

Scarlett was backed into a corner, her whole body shaking, but she didn't dare open her mouth.

Unfortunately, Scarlett wasn't the only one with a problem.

"Uh, I didn't mean to look, but, uh, whatever. I'm in a hurry. I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry, too. I know it's not the case, I know it's not the case. I know, but......."

The devil was in a hurry, too, but he was babbling like he knew what he was doing.

I don't care if you saw me in my underwear.

In the context of what's going on in the world, this is no big deal. Why are you apologizing for this?

Scarlett is just scared of the demon's sudden appearance in her room.

Scarlett has seen a lot since the war.

But in the strangest of moments, my mind went blank as I realized that I was facing a demon that I should never have encountered.

I'm afraid of the devil.

But no matter how you look at it, the gibbering demon may be embarrassed and ashamed, but he doesn't seem to care.

"You're not going to kill me....... You're not going to kill me?"

"Why would I kill you!"

Rather, it's a madman's rage.

"So right now you're embarrassed, you're scared, you're wondering why I've been doing this all this time, and you don't believe me. I know. I get it. I get it. I know you're embarrassed, but just calm down."

More than before.

However.

Scarlett couldn't help but think as she looked at Reinhardt.

I feel like I've become an even bigger weirdo than before.

It looks a little too much like Reinhardt in the Temple.

I'm an asshole.

Scarlett's tremors gradually become less frequent.

I'm not trying to kill myself.

If that's not what you're thinking, then why are you here?

"What the hell are you doing......?"

"Dude, when I hear that, there are so many things that come to mind about what you're wondering, I can't even begin to figure out what you're wondering."

You mean the gate situation.

I'm asking what you've done so far.

Or are you asking about this situation now.

There are so many things I've done that I can't figure out what you're asking.

Scarlett stares out the window.

"That....... cat?"

"Yes......."

There were probably a lot more important things to talk about, and Scarlett was dizzy about what was going on right now.

All that aside, I can't help but wonder what the devil is doing in the guise of a cat.

"This....... That....... That, uh, is actually the most complicated......?"

And Reinhardt, other things are quite complicated and hard to explain, but the cat mimicry is the hardest to explain.

It would take me about half an hour to explain what we've done so far, starting with our intentions.

Scarlett asks, watching Reinhardt's speechlessness.

The most important question.

"Ellen is....... Do you know......?"

"No, I don't know."

"......."

Despite the scary situation.

Despite the fear of the opponent.

"This crazy....... perverted asshole......."

Scarlett couldn't help but smile.

"This....... You're right, you're right, but if I'm going to get cussed out, I should get cussed out by Ellen, not you! You could have just called me a pervert with that thing earlier!"

"Trashy....... to the point of being shameless......."

I don't know about you, but in the end, pranking people with cats is the kind of perv that wouldn't say anything if he had ten mouths to feed.

"......Yes, that's the guy I'm going to kill."

The devil had no choice but to shut up.
