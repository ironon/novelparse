-Flash!

With the light, Lucinil and I returned to the outer reaches of the ecliptic.

Before she knew it, Lucinil was no longer a vampire, but a girl with silver hair and blue eyes.

I was back to being Reinhardt, not Valerie.

"Hmmm, is this your cover story?"

"Yes."

Lucinil looked me up and down in my Reinhardt form, then crossed her arms.

"He looks just like your temper."

"Well."

"Yes."

There were no humans around.

"It's been a while since the ecliptic."

Lucinil stood still, looking out over the distant landscape of the ecliptic.

"Do you have a place to stay?"

"Hmmm....... He said we should go to a guy named Count Argon Ponteus, he'll do something for us."

He was going to leave Lucinil in Sarkegar's care. I have faith that Sarkeghar will take care of it. He's capable.

Lucinil crosses her arms and stays still in thought.

"You said you were also in contact with the Black Order."

"......Yes."

"I don't know how you've been doing, but you're in real danger from here on out, so stay within my control."

Cantus Magna, and the Black Order.

As I begin to get more involved with the Covenant, I'm bound to find myself in dangerous situations. So Lucinil was going to be a close bodyguard or something.

Right.

Lucinil is right.

"......I have to go to the temple?"

"......template?"

I know this isn't the right time to say this.

I feel like I shouldn't say this after everything we've talked about.

I have to go to school! I know it's winter break, but even the Vampire Council was on a winter break schedule!

I'm a temple first!

Technically, that's the most important thing, in more ways than one!

"Oh, you....... lurking there?"

Lucinil tilted her head, as if she'd heard something from Elise.

Infiltration....... Is that right?

Isn't it?

"Hit him. Isn't this the wrong time for you to do that?"

Lucinil states the obvious, as if to say, why would you go swimming in a typhoon?

I'm not actually a kid, but it's a little dizzying to get beaten up by a guy who looks like one.

"No, I'm supposed to be at the temple, I've got too many things tied up there......."

"......What? Are you serious?"

"Yes."

Lucinil looked at me, tasted me again, and pressed her index finger to my lips.

I could feel him desperately trying to hold back a double entendre.

"No, everything happens for a reason, right?"

Honestly, it's not like I'm going to stay in the temple.

How important it was to cultivate relationships with the powers that be in the Temple in the name of rebuilding the Demon Realm. And since my classmates were the heirs to the Empire, I told them over and over what influence I had over them.

"......Now that I think about it, yes."

Lucinil nodded in agreement when I told him I was infiltrating the Temple to make connections with Imperial powers.

"That's too risky, but....... I'm not going to interfere there."

Lucinil crosses her arms and looks at me.

"I have nothing to lose if you make a fool of yourself. But be careful, Elise will be sad."

Lucinil didn't seem to want to interfere with me any more than necessary.

If you were willing to dig a little deeper, you'd realize that I'm temple living in a different sense.

That could have made things complicated, but thankfully it didn't.

"For now, then, I'll do as Elise says and go find Count Argonpontheus."

If so, they would be in touch through the Rotary Club, and when they needed Lucinil, they could send a messenger to Sarkegar. Or he could ask for Lucinil when Sarkegar came to visit on a regular basis.

I broke up with Lucinil for now.

Another cannabist. Gazoo Lucinil, the master of demand.

Eleris told me that Rusinil was more versatile than she was, but I wasn't sure what that meant yet.

Lucinil entered the ecliptic first, and then I began to enter the ecliptic as well.

Herriot has been researching dimensional magic through the resources of the Imperial Ministry of Magic. However, it is unlikely that he will be able to accomplish much in the next few days.

The achievement is on my end.

That's pretty good for only being away from the ecliptic for a few days.

"Your Majesty, the investigation indicates that nothing traceable has been found."

"I suppose."

Bertus sat in his office in the Winter Palace, reading through the written reports.

The Imperial and Crusader Knights' investigation into the deaths of Revere Lance has come to an end. The funerals have been organized, but the demons who attacked them are still being investigated.

It's clear that non-humans have attacked.

Most of the bodies were blown up and carbonized, but some were found torn apart.

They appeared to be bodies that had died while fleeing after being defeated.

Bertus flipped through the magically recorded photos of the battle.

While there are no photos, there were also multiple eyewitness accounts of something flying in the night sky in the shape of a demon.

'I wonder why.......'

Bertus stays still and thinks.

There are plenty of reasons for demons to attack the Crusaders.

It is believed that the demons attacking this time are the same ones that attacked the Crusaders last time.

There was once a powerful wizard, a lycanthrope, and a dragon. It was presumably not a real dragon, but we still don't know what it was.

During the last raid, I activated the warp gate and led the demon prisoners away.

However, there were no casualties that time.

This raid made it clear.

It's not that we couldn't deal with paladins in the last raid, we just didn't.

In other words, the demons of that time were not murderous.

But this raid was murderous. All of the paladins were slain, even Leviathan Ranze.

Maybe they didn't fight back then because their priority was to escape prisoners.

Bertus's thoughts seemed to be spiraling out of control.

It's not that there was anything suspicious, there was just too much weirdness.

While it is understandable that large-scale destructive magic was used, there are multiple eyewitness accounts of something in the form of a demon roaming the night sky.

"Why?

Doesn't it look like they've advertised that this is an attack by demons?

It would have been better to disguise it as a human quarrel, but the devil made his presence felt by flying through the night sky.

What did the demons know about the nameless order?

Do they have no idea about the current state of affairs on the continent?

If they knew, the demons should have disguised this as a fight between humans, not a show of force.

Sightings of demons are real, and some have even suggested that the assassination of an unnamed order and its leader, Revere Lance, was carried out by the Imperial or pro-Empire faction under the guise of demons.

Without the demon sightings, this would have been a powerful event that would have sparked a backlash from the Crusader Knights and the Five Lords.

If I knew that, I wouldn't have done the raid the way I did.

If I were in the position of leading a band of demons, I would never do it this way.

'It can't be stupid.'

This is the dumbest thing demons can do.

This can only help the empire.

Don't make the mistake of thinking that the remnants would be that stupid, maybe they were just being emotional, but it just fits the empire in every situation.

"Were you really trying to help the empire? Why on earth?

There's no reason why they should be, and I'm inclined to believe that the demons attacked the nameless order to aid the Empire and intentionally made their presence known.

Why you should.

Why on earth would demons do something that is only good for the empire, and at their own peril.

It's overly optimistic to view this as a mistake by the remnants.

The demons helped the empire.

Despite the situation, Bertus couldn't figure out why it had to be this way, and things were getting out of hand.

I have no idea what their intentions are.

While Bertus narrowed his eyes and worked his way through the thought.

"Your Majesty....... And regarding the matter you commissioned last time......."

The subordinate who was reporting cautiously slipped between the prince's thoughts.

Bertus, still in the midst of his deliberations, narrowed his eyes even further.

"Previously? What are you talking about?"

"That....... about the silver-haired girl......."

"Ah....... that."

It was such a big deal that Bertus had forgotten all about it.

Bertus's face widened slightly as the memory of the time he had spilled tea in his face, a very big rude awakening, resurfaced.

"Hmm, okay. Did you get anything?"

An unidentified silver-haired girl.

It's subtly Reinhardtian, so much so that I wonder if they're childhood estranged siblings.

The other day, he ran into a silver-haired girl who bore a subtle resemblance to his classmate Reinhardt and wondered if they were related.

Bertus had forgotten about it, so it was refreshing.

Technically, this is stalking.

The empire belongs to the emperor, and the first crown prince is one of the potential imperial heirs.

So, when a prince tries to stalk someone overtly, a lot of bad things happen.

"Well, I've been looking into the identity registry of the people of the Zodiac......."

"So?"

1A prince can search the entire zodiac, if not the entire empire, if he so chooses.

"We didn't have any identifying information that fit the criteria he was talking about."

"Since you said silver hair is dyed....... I didn't think there would be."

We don't have a detailed montage, so it's hard to hope that Bertus's recollections of his identity match up.

Silver hair, golden eyes, and a beauty.

It's just sketchy information.

So, even if they were actually Zodiacal subjects, it would have been difficult to find someone who fit the criteria.

"So, first of all, I looked up Reinhardt, who you said was a classmate of mine, because I thought I'd start by looking up his identity registry......."

"Well, that would have been the only possibility."

Reinhardt may be from the streets, but he has an identity.

He'd have to start with where he came from and work his way up. But the subordinate scratched his head in confusion.

"But Reinhardt's first identity was registered early last year, and I couldn't find anything before that."

"......?"

At that, Bertus shook his head.

"That's often the case. People who come from humble origins sometimes don't register their identity at all....... Or, as you said, those who spend their entire lives as street beggars have no identity at all. As you said, Reinhardt came from that, the street beggar background......."

Reinhardt's identity was first registered last year. That means he was living under a false name until then.

This is not unusual.

Clearly, it's not that weird.

At one point, however, Bertus even suspected that Reinhardt might be the heir apparent to a criminal organization.

Reinhard denied it, and Bertus didn't believe him, but he didn't do any digging.

Buha says that Reinhardt had been living under a false identity for so long that it was virtually impossible to trace his birthplace.

Now that some time has passed, Bertus knows that some of the misconceptions he had about Reinhardt are no longer true.

The Rotary Club that Reinhardt belongs to is an organization of beggars.

Reinhardt is just a beggar. Sent to Temple by the Rotary Club.

Identity registration was launched early last year.

I entered the temple too scared to register my identity and was admitted to the royal class.

So, it must have meant that he was issued an identity to enter the temple.

Bertus thinks Reinhardt is an uneducated man, but he has a lot of sense.

For someone who came from the streets, I knew a lot of things, but I also picked up a lot of things from the clubs when I was younger, so I guess you can say I have some knowledge.

However, Bertus was suddenly curious.

Did Reinhardt come from the zodiac?

Where were you born and how did you grow up?

"Well, I'll just ask him."

Where you're from.

Do you have a brother.

You just have to stop by the temple when you have time and ask.

Deciding that Reinhardt's case will have to wait, Bertus turns his attention back to the demonic group.

Still, my head felt like it was going to explode.

It's been a few days since I returned from the Vampire Council.

Not much had changed. Heriot was doing what he had to do, as was the Magical Research Society.

So I went about my normal routine of training with Olivia, waiting for Ellen to return.

By the way.

"Where are you from?"

My heart sank when Bertus, returning from the palace out of nowhere, asked me about it.

"Uh....... Huangdaoji."

"Where is the ecliptic?"

What is it?

What did we catch?

My heart was pounding like crazy.

But in desperation, I kept up the pretense of nonchalance through self-suggestion.

"Well, I don't know about that, I was abandoned when I was too young. I was sleeping on the street. Do you think he remembers that?"

"...... is it?"

I've been thinking about how I grew up.

But Bertus is on to something, and if he knows my identity, I must leave the ecliptic.

But, so suddenly?

But if you knew the truth, you wouldn't be asking me so casually, would you?

It was just a casual question. Bertus stared at me, arms crossed, and seemed to be thinking about something.

"Why are you asking me that now?"

I finally asked. Bertus seemed to consider for a moment, then sighed heavily.

"...... I hate to say it, but huh. Well, yeah."

Bertus puts his hand on my shoulder and says, "Be still.

"Do you have a brother?"

a.

No way.

That's it!

"Oh, no, not at all. First of all, I don't remember anything....... looks like......."

"I saw a girl who looked a lot like you during the last festival. I thought maybe she was your brother, so I thought I'd look her up, but it's hard to find someone you only know by face."

"Uh, yeah, that's right......."

Dizzy.

I feel like throwing up.

"So I looked up your identity because I can look you up if I know where you're from, but last year was the first time you registered your identity?"

That sent goosebumps all over my body.

My cross-dressing encounter with Bertus was leading to a background check on me.

I'm pretty sure Bertus doesn't know anything yet, and I don't think he's suspicious that I was the first to register an identity last year when I didn't have one.

Dangerous.

It's really dangerous to go any further.

"So....... I hate to tell you this, but your parents abandoned you, and since....... you have a brother, you might not even know you have a brother, so I'm not going to do this if you don't want me to, but if you do, I'm going to do some personal......."

No.

It can also be coarse.

It must be prevented.

You might start out as a goodwill gesture and find out who you are.

This is not a joke, this is a real life threatening situation.

No other options exist.

Almost spinal cord reflexes.

"That's me."

I had no choice but to tell the truth.

"......? What?"

Bertus didn't seem to understand what he was hearing.

"That's me."

I even wondered to myself what I was looking at.

"What......? Huh? What?"

Bertus began to doubt his ears.

I escaped death, but.......

I wanted to die.
