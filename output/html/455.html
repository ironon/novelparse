The next person I went to was Airi.

"Bali......."

Airi was sitting by the window of the state room, looking out.

As they all do.

Everyone was looking outside in their own way, as if they couldn't bear not to see how today's catastrophe was affecting the city.

When I arrived, Airi was carrying a child in her arms and staring blankly at a lizard monster that was running at her.

If Herriot had been any later, Airi could have been dead.

We don't know what happened to Airi to make her hate humans so much.

However, I wonder if Airi eventually realized that something is worth protecting, regardless of race.

I explained it to Airi as I had to everyone else.

What I was trying to do.

And what we're going to do next.

"I can't believe you tried to stop this......."

"It didn't work, but oh well. I did."

"Funny. I'm surprised you weren't actually interested in rebuilding the Demon Realm, but you ended up being forced to do it."

Airi stares out the window in silence.

"If we're starting over here, the Darklands we're going to rebuild are the ones that contain humans, right?"

"Probably not."

You can control demons with your abilities, but you cannot control humans with your abilities.

You can take over a castle, you can control a town.

But one nation. All lands beyond the horizon of my sight are my country, and if there are humans under my rule that I cannot see, and if they reject me.

What is a king supposed to do, how is he supposed to rule over people, by what logic?

I don't know.

"Something....... romantic."

Airi stared out the window, wondering if she was imagining a Darklands that included humans, and this time she looked at me.

"You know, Valerie."

"What?"

"It's romanticized because it's not easy."

"......."

A country of all demons, plus humans.

As romantic as that sounds, it's probably not possible.

That's why it's called romantic, because it's as difficult to realize as it is beautiful.

"But I'm a dreamer, right?"

Airi smiles at me.

"Bali, if that's your dream."

"......."

"Since I no longer have the ability to give you that dream, I'll try to make it happen in real life."

Succubus, a demon associated with dreams.

It's a demon that drains energy by making someone dream, but now it's impossible to make someone dream.

So, try to make that dream come true.

The words struck a chord, a deep chord.

Airi stares out the window.

Torch-bearing soldiers could be seen moving down a distant cliff.

"Still....... I wish I had that power today."

"...... is it?"

The power to dream.

Why is that a bad thing in this situation?

"Many children will have lost their parents and siblings. They won't be able to sleep, and if they do, they won't be able to get out of those nightmares......."

"Ah."

"Even if I couldn't save someone's reality, I could have given them a comfortable dream for the moment they fell asleep. Even if there was hell after they woke up, I could have given them happiness for the moment they fell asleep....... I could have given them a moment of happiness......."

So that you can have a restful dream, not absorb energy.

To help you escape the nightmare of reality and find some respite, if only in your dreams.

If the nightmare resurfaces after you wake up, you'll have a moment of peace.

It was as if he wanted to use his power for the sake of suffering souls, not for the sake of someone else's energies.

The succubus's power to gift dreams is a diabolical one.

It's a power that can't save anyone's reality, but it will be damn sweet.

But it's the kind of power that can't save someone, even if you truly want to use it to save them.

A human receiving a dream from a succubus, and a succubus giving a dream to a human.

It becomes a truly sad power when a succubus uses it to want someone's happiness, rather than to want theirs.

Because neither demons nor humans can give or receive true salvation.

But Airi was missing her powers, knowing that even the slightest bit of anesthesia would be needed for those who had been through hell.

If.

to be.

A feature that has never been used before.

Use 'Add settings'.

The succubus' horns, they grow back.



[This feature is disabled].



Again, no.



[There would have to be a "common sense revision" to add that setting].

[Adding settings at that level cannot be done].



I thought I knew what it meant.

It's common knowledge that a demon's severed horns don't grow back.

But if you add a setting that allows severed horns to grow back, you're going to have to revise the common sense of every succubus and airy who has ever believed that horns don't grow back.

It's not just adding a setting, it's rewriting the world.

So it can't be done.

But importantly, he didn't just say it couldn't be done, he added a caveat.

If I try to do it, can I do it?

If so, does that mean I can use it in a way that doesn't cause common sense modifications?

This asshole will never let me use this system feature when it matters most.

Just like I couldn't turn things around with a retirement.

I'm not sure I'd want to use it in a situation like this, though.

It should be applied in a fairly limited sense, not too broadly.

The more granular and restrictive it is, the more likely you are to add to it.

No common sense tweaks happening there.

If so, you'll have to add a good reason.

Something that can cause horns to grow that shouldn't.

Reason.

No, not necessarily rational, but something that could cause something to happen that shouldn't normally happen.

Anything goes, so plausible deniability.

Rationale for making it so anyway.

a.

I thought I knew what to do.

Use the Add Settings feature.

'I', by the power of the 'Unspoken', can 'cause' the 'horns of the succubus race' to 'grow back'.

Add very limited and restrictive settings.

The power to make anything possible, but not even I know where to start.

If it's a verbalization, it can be used as a basis.



[Adding this setting requires 10,000 achievement points].



becomes.

It's not a small price to pay, but I have over 100,000 achievement points.

There's no reason not to use it.



[Use 10,000 achievement points].

[Setting added].



It's a feature I only used again after a very long time.

I stare at Airi.

"You have horns."

"Ah....... Why the horns?"

"It will grow back."

"......?"

Airi tilted her head, as if she didn't know what he was talking about.

He doesn't know what happened to him, and she doesn't.

"It's just, you know."

"Uh....... Yeah."

If I explain the details, you won't understand anyway.

Only after the horns have grown back will you know what I meant.

I'll have to tell the other succubus the same thing.

You never know how the power to make someone dream will help them later.

As the former King of Heaven, Succubus Queen, and mother of Airi, Reina used the power of the Monma to terrorize and paralyze humans into submission.

Airi, however, uses it to save the suffering.

"Thanks for the kind words, Valerie."

Airi grinned at what could have sounded like some sort of malicious prank, depending on your perspective.

"Because you say so. Like it's going to happen....... I have a weird feeling."

What Airi would look like if she really did grow horns again.

A little, I wondered.



* * *



Herriot said there must be something we could do.

Olivia told me I didn't have to do anything, that I shouldn't do anything.

Airi seemed to have changed her mind.

I don't know what they think of humans, but they seem to have a lot of affection for children.

Lerouen and Galarsh were out of the palace, and the last person left was Eleris.

"Ah....... Your Highness."

Charge, not degradation.

I wonder if they've cleaned up their titles now that they're kings," Eleris said, looking at me from the throne room.

Was it possible to be a king in a day?

I became king, not to rebuild the realm, but to deal with the Gate debacle that eventually happened.

In the end, I won't be able to escape the shackles of being a gatekeeper.

One way or another, the gate was bound to happen.

If I hadn't done anything, would the gate have happened in some way?

I don't know.

However, Eleris is the one who caused the gate, and I want to do something about it.

Elise was sitting alone at the table, scribbling away at whatever it was she was doing.

"What were you doing?"

"Ah....... new magic....... I've been thinking about."

"Magic?"

In response to my question, Eleris continued with a gloomy expression.

"There will be a lot of people who have lost their homes....... So we'll need a place to house them, even if only temporarily....... I thought I'd try my hand at creating some magic to organize a temporary home for that sort of thing......."

"Ah."

I couldn't help but notice the misery on Eleris's face.

It's a very strange thing to do, to try to fix a disaster you've created.

She would rather wish for death.

Saving people had ended up like this, and no matter how much pressure she was under, Eleris had activated Akasha with her own hands, with her own will. To save me.

I was told that the Akasha I used was gone.

Akasha itself was already otherworldly, so it didn't technically disappear, but Akasha became the Gate itself.

Gate events are not something you can bite off.

That's why the guilt she's feeling now is more than she can handle.

Letting her die might have been a good choice for her.

I can't imagine the miserable feelings and guilt that Elise must be going through as she does this with an overwhelming amount of guilt.

Elise and I would be sinners.

Ellen seemed to think this was all her fault, but I don't think so.

I'm grateful to the three of them for trusting me in this situation.

But I don't blame Ellen and Charlotte for not believing me. They didn't believe me, and I think I had a lot of evidence to back that up.

Resentment and hatred won't solve anything. The real enemy I have to deal with is not Ellen or Charlotte, but the monsters at the gate.

So the blame for this whole mess falls on me and Elise.

Eleris seemed to envision that kind of magic, to make a home, even temporarily, for those who had lost theirs.

It's a small piece of magic, but it's absolutely necessary in this situation.

That won't be the end of it.

If I hadn't met Elise, if I hadn't met the demon spies, the gate incident would not have happened.

Still, on the road to Akasha, I told Elise that I wouldn't regret any of this.

Even if our meeting is remembered as something to regret, I decided not to regret it.

It all twisted and turned to get here, but I chose to do it, and I don't regret it.

"I don't regret it."

"......."

So when she heard me say those words again, she hung her head in dismay.

"Because there's still work to be done, and I don't think the price we pay will necessarily bring only bad things, because I don't think it will......."

I put my hand on Elyse's shoulder as she bowed her head.

"Anything we can do, let's do it."

There's nothing I can do about Eleris's guilt.

No matter how much pressure was put on her, she made a choice.

The world and me.

At the crossroads, Eleris was the one who should have chosen the world.

It certainly was.

I regretted so much killing, and I wanted to make amends, even if it was just a little, so I should have never activated Akasha, even if it meant abandoning Eleris.

However, Eleris abandoned the world and chose me.

Everyone else will point to Eleris as the guilty party, and the world should be unable to forgive her for causing the Gate.

But I shouldn't.

No matter how much responsibility she felt, no matter how much pressure she felt from others, Elise made her own choice.

You don't even have to ask why.

He would have traded me for the whole world because he loved me, because he valued me.

You destroyed the world.

To the one who loved me enough to do so.

Why.

Shouldn't you have let me die?

I can't say that.

The world, even my own people, may come to hate Eleris as much as the source of the horrors to come, but not me.

I must love Eleris.

I have to be on Eleris' side.

"Too....... Too....... I'm sorry. I've done everything....... I'm afraid I've....... I have ruined......."

"No, it's fine."

It's not okay, but.

You should say yes.

To the heart of Eleris, in this love.

I am grateful.

"charge to....... No....... to lose you....... It would be....... to lose you too...... too....... So scared....... So sad that it all has to end like this....... Too sorry to....... So sad that....... to lose you......."

A sobbing Elise hugged me.

"No matter what....... I didn't want to lose......."

Eleris held me close and cried for a long time.

I hugged her, too.

Like you're never going to let go again.
