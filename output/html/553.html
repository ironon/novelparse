            Episode 553.





After exiting the unmarked graveyard, we had to wait out the night.

When night falls, we will curse the land, and with the power of corruption, we will raise the dead to serve as our army.

I'm going to make an exception for Loyard and Effinghauser, and there's nothing I can say to rationalize it.

That's what we're going to do, so that's what we're going to do.

By the way.

The unthinkable happened.

There are many mourners.

In particular, there are too many people wearing military uniforms.

And in real time.

While it's not strange to see men in military uniforms on the ecliptic, it's certainly strange to see them in large numbers in a national cemetery.

Everyone looks like they've been away and come back.

Soon, he had the look of a man in a Union garrison.

They're soldiers, and they're back.

"Did they get a group vacation because the occupation of Serandia is over?"

"I think so......."

The Allies are going to hold their breath until they fly through the winter.

So, while not everyone could return to the ecliptic, it was clear that some were privileged to do so.

While there are many places that would be the first stop for those who have long since left the ecliptic, this national cemetery would hold the gravestones of the soldiers, knights, and mages who fought in the Gate Crisis.

It's only natural, then, that Allied officials would visit this national cemetery.

The original Serandia campaign didn't take place in the winter, and the Allies chose to hold out while the rest of the world faced winter.

So the war of attrition to protect your base continues.

However, with Serandia now pacified, the Alliance is well on its way to ensuring the safety of nearby garrisons.

It's a relatively safe environment, so the entire army won't be able to return, but high-ranking and specialized people may be able to spend the winter in the ecliptic or back in their home countries. It depends on the person, of course.

So with the monsters of Serandia's neighborhoods eradicated, the area should be fairly safe. That's why there are soldiers returning via mass teleportation to the ecliptic.

A national cemetery is very likely to be on the itinerary for returnees. It's where their comrades-in-arms are laid to rest, and many will want to visit, both in groups and individually.

Some people get a vacation because the march has been long.

Naturally, common soldiers will not be able to return to the ecliptic without some sort of extraordinary event. It's not a warp gate, and traveling via mass teleportation is not a right of passage.

So.

High ranking members of the military, high ranking Imperial commanders, or nobles.

A high-ranking knight, cleric, or wizard.

And it's a privilege reserved for royalty.



* * *



Cognitive dissonance magic is not a one-size-fits-all. Good knights and high-level mages can see through magic without even casting it. This is true of invisibility, and all other types of stealth-based magic.

There is no such thing as a trick that can fool anyone, although it can be highly sophisticated.

Even superpowers have something rare: dual resistance. I'm one of them.

So, there's no magic trick to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.

Sure, Herriot could cast high-level stealth-based magic, but a clumsy cast could give away his movements.

While the people who walk into a national park one after the other may be completely oblivious to the magic, there may be others who can see through our cognitive dissonance.

I can camouflage myself into something close to a shapeshifter, but Olivia or Herriot can't.

We may be able to shield ourselves from the gaze of unspecified military officials coming in now, but we don't know when they'll catch us.

We're not in a bad place, but we're getting there.

"Let's get out of here, I don't want to get into trouble with one of the imperial wizards while we're here."

"Yeah, I guess I should."

You need to get out before the more dangerous people get to the national cemetery.

Originally, there was no such thing as a vacation for the Allies.

It was clear from the crowds entering the national cemetery that this victory meant a great deal to the Allies.

You can see this in the leaderboard.

There are also a significant number of non-commanders. This suggests that the Alliance is currently giving a wide range of furloughs.

Honestly, you can't help it, you've just raised your major.



* * *



I don't know if I'd call it an escape, but me, Olivia, and Harriet made it out of the national cemetery before we got caught by the powers that be.

In a secluded park nearby, on a half-broken bench, Olivia sat in a daze.

-pot!

"I checked, and the Allied forces are still returning from the square in front of the Imperial Palace. I think they're using mass teleportation."

So said Herriot, who quickly scouted the Allied return via short-range space travel.

"The Allies are pretty solidly excited about this victory, aren't they?"

Olivia crossed her arms and clicked her tongue at the bad timing.

Victory.

Yes, there were irreparable deaths, but it was never a defeat.

No, that's the kind of victory that requires a break.

"For morale, I guess, because it was a big sacrifice."

The situation has stabilized, and the military will be taking a long break. Those who wish to return to the ecliptic will be allowed to do so now, like a free ticket. Of course, it will take a long time to reintroduce them to the battlefield, and they won't be returning in overwhelming numbers.

"But this will only make the regular soldiers who don't make it back more....... depressed......."

Herriot wasn't sure if this was a good idea, and seemed to wonder if it was a morale booster, regardless of how disruptive it was to our operations.

I wonder if they feel deprived if only high-ranking people can rest on the ecliptic.

Olivia smirked at Harriet's nervous reaction.

"Do you think there are many people who have a place to come back to? Even if you let them go, most of them wouldn't want to. Didn't you see? This place can't even get a decent fucking meal. If the ecliptic is like this, what about the other cities that still exist?"

"Oh....... I see......."

Not everyone's home is in the ecliptic.

Those who join the military out of fear of starvation may be afraid to leave.

Many common soldiers may feel more at home in a garrison with food and shelter than in their hellish homeworlds across the Zodiac or the Alliance.

The battlefield is cozier.

The reality for the Allied forces is that most of them will not be able to enjoy their vacations because they have nothing to go back to.

So there would be a very small number of people who would actually return to the ecliptic, and that's why it's possible for even very low ranking soldiers to return to the ecliptic.

"That's the problem, by the way, I don't know who's going to be in that cemetery and when."

I'm not sure there will be any master classes or archmages among them, let alone a full-time staff.

"If we try it once and we get caught or something, there won't be a second time, because the guards will be on high alert. Of course, we could just kill them all and go ahead with the ritual, but that's not something you'd allow in the first place, Reinhardt."

"Sis....... Then what's the point of making a Death Knight......."

"I'm not going to do it anyway, because once the Allies start marching again, we won't have time to bother with it, and by then we'll be busy too......."

"Damn, I wish I'd come a day earlier......."

It happens, and I can't help it, but it's going to get worse.

If you're making Death Knight to make people die less, and you're making Death Knight because you want to make Death Knight, and you're killing all the people in the national cemetery to make Death Knight, it's not a bad thing or not, it's just a reversal of behavior.

"Well, first of all, no one's going to come to pay their respects at night, so it's going to be a lot less crowded, but there's a what if, and you have to realize that the combat power of the entire zodiac has been raised considerably in this situation, so if there's a disturbance....... You know?"

"......Yes."

The higher-ups aren't just powerful, they're also likely to be Knights of Shanapelle or Imperial Mages.

If there's an inevitable fight, something ridiculous might happen. You might be able to escape via Heriot, but there's always a what if.

There probably aren't that many people in the national cemetery at night anyway.

However, there may be a few who are dangerously powerful or able to tap into our consciousness.

I'd rather wait until after winter and when people are falling off the ecliptic.

National cemeteries are very large.

If there's even one or two people in that vast area, and Olivia starts creating Deathknights through ritual, someone's going to see them come out of the ground or coffin lids.......

"Let's change the order."

"Order?"

"More eyes on the national cemetery. There's one place that's not going to change much, right?"

A place most of the public can't even enter.

"The imperial mausoleum. Let's rob it from there."

It's probably a pretty deserted place, even now with the military out on mass leave.

So even if you do get robbed, it's only a matter of time before it's discovered.

We will visit the imperial mausoleum first, and then return here.



* * *



I'm unilaterally helping Bertus, but I never asked for his permission to do so.

It's a big step over the line to begin with. I don't know what else to say to Bertus, even if he really wants to kill me after this.

It's no different than a national cemetery or an imperial mausoleum. Bertus would bite his tongue and die on the spot if he were to suggest that the bodies and remains there be brought back to life as Deathknights and used for power.

Since it's a one-way street, let's do some one-way looting.

I thought the national cemetery would be a little easier, but the circumstances made it a little trickier. More eyes means more risk of being spotted, and more chance of those eyes belonging to the wrong people.

First the Imperial Mausoleum, then the National Cemetery.

Secure the Death Knights and flee.

"Okay, now I have to do something called infiltrating the planet Huangshan......."

We were now north of the ecliptic, so to the south we could see the imposing walls of the great planet Emperatos.

It's a fortified place, both physically and magically.

A magical barrier on the same level as a temple.

What's even more impressive is that when the barrier is fully operational, it can stop quite a few meteors.

And a binding that prevents demons from entering. Sarkegar and I can pass through after transformation, but Airi cannot.

Of course, Charlotte, a half-demon, was just fine, so I'm guessing that in some cases it's just temporarily turned off, or that it doesn't matter internally.

Charlotte shared a few ways to do this.

First, how to use underground waterways.

"They say there's a way to get to the sewers on the palace side via the aqueducts....... The Empire isn't stupid, the aqueducts are naturally guarded against human passage, and I don't know if I can dispel it, but if I could, I'd probably be able to get in there, at least not in plain sight."

There is an opening.

But it's there, and it's not going to be anything out of the ordinary.

Charlotte said the floodgates would be impenetrable, let alone alarmed.

If you can break through, you can enter the city without being seen. You just don't know if you can or not.

If Charlotte knew how anyone could sneak into the palace in the first place, she was in a position to prevent that from happening because she's royalty, so it doesn't make sense for her to know how to sneak into the palace in the first place.

"I suppose we could sneak into the wagons that carry tributes and other goods that go into the palace, but....... Of course, we'd have to avoid being spotted at the checkpoints, and we'd have to disguise or buy the wagon once we got there, so we wouldn't be the only ones in trouble."

"I guess so......."

Herriot sighed.

"I'm the only one with access to the Imperial Palace, so I'm going to stab someone in the back and steal their ID or whatever, and then I'm going to get in, and there's no point in me getting in in the first place......."

How to get the real deal.

How to disguise your ID.

How to use waterways.

There are ways to disguise someone's username, but that's not possible now that they no longer have connections to the imperial family.

Obviously, you can't tell Bertus to open the gate because you're going to rob the imperial mausoleum.

"It's either him or me, or we're going to have to go underground to the part of the planet that's beneath Neptune, and then we're going to have to dig it out and blast it upwards, but of course that's going to touch the crystals, so we're going to need magical protection."

No matter how versatile Herriot is, it's too much to ask for it to be able to handle on its own.

It's not all magic.

In the first place, all the methods Charlotte knows are prepared methods.

Charlotte tries as hard as she can, but in the end, she can't tell you how to get in.

"What the hell, how was I supposed to get into the palace if I couldn't do this or that?"

Olivia pursed her lips.

"It's not that you can't, it's that you can, but it's risky."

At the end of the day, it's a matter of possibility, not a matter of never.

But it's risky.

And it's best to be stealthy.

"It's a big deal after all, maybe not a day ago, but it's a big deal now."

There is no guarantee that we will die, but there is also no guarantee that we will be able to escape.

There's a reason for this, and it's a good one.

You've been caught trying to steal or break into an imperial mausoleum at the wrong time, so it's bullshit to say that you had some sort of circumstance.

We're really going to do something bad, and persuasion is pointless.

"You can't get in there with magic, can you?"

"You don't know how to ......, but yeah. Realistically."

It is not possible to teleport into the planet.

There are many ways to do this, but in the end, there is one that is the safest for now.

"Let's use our superpowers."

If magic doesn't work, superpowers.

"Superpowers......? No way......?"

"Yeah, didn't we run into each other not too long ago?"

Conolint is required.

"I don't know if he's here by now, but....... There's a meeting place. Let's go there. He might be there."

"Promise? Lint's supposed to help you with this? When? Did you go to the Allied camp, bird? Did you have time for that?"

At my words, Harriet shook her head in disbelief.

"No? I didn't promise her anything."

"What? Then who did you promise?"

"Sarkegarang."

At my words, Olivia and Harriet's expressions turned sour.

You didn't have time to talk to Kono Lint?

I promised the person I was going to bring.

Against your will, of course.

"and......."

"Some things never change for us Reinhards......."

Neither Olivia nor Harriet could hide their displeasure.



* * *



The meeting was at a place that was once the headquarters of a Rotary Club.

It was an underground aqueduct under the Bronzegate Bridge.

"You crazy bastard, what do you want me to do?"

There was Conor Lint, who had obviously been captured, held captive by Antirrhinus.

And Sarkegar, a new face, but obviously disguised as a female Allied soldier, was also present.

"There's something I need you to help me with."

You or me.

Now the scale is much different than it used to be.

As I put my arm around his shoulders, his complexion turned a deep shade of blue.

"Get your hands off my, my body, you pervert!"

Of course.

He was annoyed, but in a different sense than before.

"?"

"......?"

And none of them had any idea what the word pervert meant.



* * *



"My, why should I help you!"

Kono Lint's multifaceted, terrified voice echoed through the sewers.

There's no Rotary Club, the refugees are in camps, the beggars under the bridge are gone, so if he shouted, if it rang out, no one would hear him.

"Because you're the only one who can help me in this situation."

"......is that the attitude of a person asking for help?"

No, you're right.

There's no way to stop psychic powers unless you're one of the truly special few, and infiltrating the ecliptic is a piece of cake for Kono Lint, and he can let others in.

"No, didn't you listen to me in the first place? What are you saying you can't help me after coming all this way?"

"I would not have come of my own accord....... but I wouldn't have come if I'd known it was going to be like this!"

"What? Then what did you think happened......."

I suddenly had a clearer picture of Sarkhegar at Antony's side.

Sarkegar disguised as a female Allied soldier.

Somehow atypical.

And a pretty girl.

"......Am I right?"

Did this asshole get caught in this pattern again?

"No! No! No matter what you think......!"

-Kurrrrrr

"Uh, what is it?"

Konorint's complexion went white as Sarkegar changed from the form of an Allied soldier to that of Count Argon Ponteus, a form he had once often assumed.

This is the second time you've seen this.

The transformed Sarkegar chuckles.

"It was easy, Your Majesty. I asked them to help me, and they followed without asking."

A poor pretty girl who appears to have been conscripted at an age when she shouldn't know anything about fighting.

You can't learn from Kono Lint without breaking his heart.

He looks puzzled and mumbles something.

"Fooled again....... Fooled again......."

"......Some things never change for you either."

It was Herriot who said that, not the other me.

"No! I'm the kind of person who helps anyone who asks me for help! Never! Never! That's not what I do....... Woman....... Fuck......."

Kono Lint cried out, his face falling.

"Yeah! I know, and now all these girls that come into my life are going to be assholes like you, uh, fuck, I'm not falling for it anymore!"

He eventually broke down in frustration.

If you think about it.

He's arguably the biggest victim of my misdeeds.

"...... Does this happen to you often? What does he mean?"

"Really?"

Naturally, the sound was bizarre, and Olivia and Herriot scratched their heads.

"Well, I don't need to know that!"

I glared at Konorint as if I would kill him if he said any more.
