Across from her, Olivia Ranze smiled weakly. Whereas Herriot's expression was tense, her opponent's was relaxed.

That arrogant attitude didn't sit well with Herriot.

"I wonder if I was once like that.

There was a time when everything in the world seemed smaller and more ridiculous than you.

Everything is determined at birth, and I don't understand why people are so desperate to be born.

There was a time when I would just laugh at them without trying to understand them. Even now, I don't think I've completely abandoned that part of myself, but I do realize that I need to work on it.

The opponent is arrogant.

Sure, she's known for her selflessness, as her nickname, Saint of Eredian, suggests, but for some reason she acts like a terrible person when it comes to Reinhardt.

I'd argue with Ellen.

Intentionally ignore yourself.

That look I get every time.

They put on a coy smile, hide their true colors, and try to provoke others.

Herriot knows the odds are stacked against him. He's seen that monster fight.

But that mask.

That abomination of a face, thick as hell.

Angry, frustrated, pissed off, whatever.

I'm going to rip that mask off for once.

I'm not going to let you look at me like that and ignore me forever.

-And now, the final match of the quarterfinals, Group C! Let's get started!

Olivia Ranze stares at Harriet.

"I hate sloppy work. I'll make it quick."

Olivia's body is covered in blue mana.

Dense mana surrounds her.

I hate clunky.

Herriot couldn't believe Olivia's words.

"That's not what someone who clings to a hated Reinhardt would say, is it?"

"Oh, that?"

Olivia smiles and slowly walks toward Harriet, not running.

"I like it so much that I have to do something I really don't like."

"......."

"You can't say that, can you?"

Olivia continues to approach Harriet with a dazzling smile.

Someone who is honest with their heart.

Someone you can be honest with.

Someone who is willing to push through, even if it hurts someone else because of their heart.

He accepts that in order to gain something, he must lose something, and so he tries to keep Reinhardt, even if it means hurting himself and Ellen.

Harriet felt a sudden surge of envy for Olivia.

But it's frighteningly infrequent. Your opponent is only provoking you.

That moment when Herriot tries to stop thinking about what the other person said to keep his cool.

She stomps her foot on the ground in a vicious manner.

-Tat!

The sound was light.

-shhhh!

However, the pace was not light.

-Chee!

Olivia's fist slammed into the blue force field as the protection activated before Herriot's eyes.

-Quack!

"!"

A fist was thrust in front of Herriot's nose as the protection collapsed.

-pot!

In the split second before she was about to strike, Herriot closed the distance with a blink. Olivia spun around and smiled at the sweating Herriot.

"That's fast."

Casting a blink scared the protection into collapse.

But unlike Olivia's laid-back demeanor, Harriet didn't have time to play around with Olivia.

-Flash!

A bolt of lightning slammed into Olivia's body.

This is the tactic I used in the first match. After creating distance with Blink, he unleashes a barrage of offensive magic to strip away the protection of Enchantment.

There are plenty of people who have gotten screwed in the qualifiers with this simple method.

If you're afraid of proximity, don't allow it.

Once a Lightning Bolt spell has been cast, the hit is almost instantaneous. This makes it nearly impossible to dodge. Of course, a normal person would be stunned or cut off by the blast, but an enchanted opponent is different.

It's better to make him incapacitated with a highly destructive fireball.

So far, so good.

But Olivia shrugged off the blow and charged at Harriet again, as if it hadn't happened. She didn't flinch, not even slightly.

Of course, Herriot expected this.

-Thump!

Herriot flicked his hand, and the arena floor rose, creating a stone wall.

Protection is easily breached.

If so, create a physical wall.

One, your opponent doesn't have a strategy.

"Lead."

I trust the overwhelming physics and push in.

"Are you going to stop me one bit?"

-Quack!

Olivia Ranze lunged at Herriot, smashing through the rising stone wall with her bare hands.

"I'm not trying to stop you.

In that short time, Herriot had already cast his spell.

There's no way a wall is going to stop Olivia.

Your opponent is overpowered.

If so, you don't need to win by force, you need to win by other means.

The idea behind building a wall is to disappear from your opponent's view.

The magic used is Hallucination. It causes hallucinations and prevents you from recognizing your own presence.

The magic is endless.

Confuse your opponent's perceptions, causing them to go on a rampage and lose the game.

Your opponent won't recognize you now. You've just broken through a wall and jumped out, and you've disappeared into thin air.

But.

Herriot felt it the moment he cast the spell.

'Resistance......?'

The spell cast at Olivia deflected.

Why.

This is intermediate, if not superlative, psychic magic.

It's not magic that can be so easily resisted.

Herriot could only watch as Olivia's fist flew toward him.



* * *



The first set was taken by Olivia after a short battle.

After being re-called back into the arena, Herriot stared blankly at Olivia's smiling face.

Illusions above Illusion were not just less effective, they were not effective at all.

"I can see what you were trying to do."

Olivia speaks to Harriet with her hands on her hips, as if to give her special instructions.

"Most psychic magic doesn't work on me, sweetheart."

Hearing those words, Herriot's head seemed to freeze over.

Not surprisingly, it's not well known that Olivia Ranze has an immune level of resistance to mind-based magic.

It's not surprising that Herriot doesn't know this.

But the price of not knowing was that all of her plans were wiped out.

I was hoping that the solution would be to use spirit-based magic since I can't physically match him, but it turns out that it doesn't work against him at all.

There's no way that was a bluff. Herriot could clearly feel the spell not having the slightest effect.

I was expecting some anti-horsemanship, but I wasn't expecting it to be completely ineffective.

"What's with the look of disbelief on your face? Isn't that the way the world works? Everyone is born with something. This is a place where you're supposed to be a natural."

Temples.

The royal class is where they gather.

"Just as you're a nonsensical person in your own way, I'm bound to be a nonsensical person in my own way, right?"

The second set was about to start.

"If that's all you've got, just abstain."

Olivia is still smiling.

"Before I make myself even more miserable."

I realized that the number of tricks I had up my sleeve in unfavorable situations didn't work in the first set.

It was hopeless.

I thought there was only one other person with that talent, Scarlett from Class B, but it turns out there's more.

Herriot's mind was racing now that his only option was gone.

-Ma! Bam!

And then, through the chaos, a voice broke through.

One side of the bleachers.

I heard a familiar voice.

You don't have to look at it to know.

If you call yourself that, you're the only one in the world.

-Don't pout!

He was shouting at himself. Not to win, not to be strong.

It's just a way of saying, "Don't suck. That statement in and of itself is not encouraging at all.

But.

"Chit."

Herriot could see Olivia Ranze's expression twist slightly as she heard the same shout.

It's times like these that you root for the underdog, and Reinhardt certainly said so.

It was a little nerve-wracking to hear him say that when he was sure he was going to lose.

But.

At the end of the day, it's all about results.

Reinhardt is cheering himself on.

-Don't squirm, just go for it!

Reinhardt is rooting for Herriot de Sanctuan, not Olivia Lanze.

"I guess this is what you mean by feeling like a winner even when you lose."

"......."

Harriet laughed at Olivia's stony expression.

The smile vanished from Olivia's face. There was no playful taunt, no sarcastic remark.

Herriot's confused thoughts were drowned out by Reinhardt's shout, but as it turned out, something worse could have been in store for Herriot.

"This is, like, weird."

Olivia Ranze was angry now.

Dear Herriot.

To Reinhardt.

"This sucks, I'm done."

The start of the second set had already been announced.

Olivia pounces again.

Herriot didn't bother to protect this time. Suddenly, strings of blue power lines appeared on the back of Herriot's hand, glowing blue.

"Suck!"

-Quadruple!

"!"

In an instant, the stadium cracked and the whole thing collapsed.

"Boom!"

Taking advantage of an off-balance Olivia Ranze stumbling, Herriot spread her hands.

The spell you just cast is called Shockwave.

With that, the terrain collapsed.

It's not low-level magic by any means.

And then there's some higher-level magic.

One set.

There's no looking back. I'll take a set at all costs.

Herriot stretched both hands to the sky.

A giant fireball that can't be compared to a fireball.

"Take this!"

A flame strike rushed toward the staggering Olivia Ranze.

-Koo-koo-koo-koo!

A massive explosion of flames engulfed Olivia Ranze.

The backs of Herriot's hands and forearms glowed with blue energy lines.



* * *



Suddenly, the stadium is blown to smithereens, and with it, a devastating flame strike.

The overwhelming spectacle left the audience speechless.

"It doesn't make sense."

Saviolin Tana, who had been watching the situation, spoke up briefly.

"I don't care how much of a genius Herriot de Saint-Etienne is, casting a spell of destruction on that scale and at that speed is simply impossible."

"......Are you saying I cheated or something?"

"Well....... But I don't think that's a normal way to use a spell at all. Just look at that symbol that suddenly appeared on the student's body......."

As Saviolin Tana had said, Herriot's hands had formed blue letters. They were gone now.

I cast a series of mass destruction spells. The time difference was almost non-existent. Ellen, me, Riana.

Everyone was stunned by the sight.

"No way....... Harriet is......."

I grabbed Ellen by the shoulders and shook her.

"Dude, does he have a tattoo now?"

"......?"

Herriot.

I don't know what it is, but it looks like a tattoo!

No, why not!

I can do it! I can do it! I can do it! Yes, I can!

"Does that matter to you right now?"

"Well, but!"

Riana's presence made me feel like crying. There were definitely guys here who knew what the hell that was.

"Louis, what the hell is going on, what has the Ministry of Magic done to our little bugger!"

At my near-scream, Louis turned to look at me from the front seat.

As if he had no idea I would react this way.

"Oh, no....... Why are you being so obnoxious?"

Louis sighed heavily, as if to calm himself.

"It's scroll magic."

"......What is that?"

Louis looks at Herriot, who is standing on one side of the half-destroyed arena.

"Herriot, you're writing a magic scroll in real time."

This is.......

What the hell is that supposed to mean?



* * *



-What did the Ministry of Magic do to my pout!

It wasn't just Reinhardt who was confused, but the archduke and his wife as well.

So I didn't even pay attention to Reinhardt, who was calling his daughter a punk.

"My baby....... What is that?"

"Well....... I'm not sure."

Even the magical Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan couldn't figure out what his daughter had done to his body.

It was a sight that no one had ever heard of or seen before. Of course, the Archduke was not as horrified as Reinhardt.

He is a wizard before he is a high noble. As such, he lives with the mindset of a mage.

"Looks like my daughter has already done something to shock the world."

It doesn't matter if you win or lose this fight.

The Grand Duke of St. Thuan had a hunch that his daughter had developed a new system of magic that had never been seen before.



* * *



Casting.

It's the beginning and end of the magic.

But casting still takes time, and no amount of speed can make that time zero. Magic is a great and convenient power, but if you're going to use it for combat, it's going to have a fatal flaw: casting time.

Given time, magic can destroy everything.

That said, with such a short preparation time for casting, there are times when Battlemages with such great skill can die for nothing.

Casting is a natural part of the process, and the idea of eliminating it is unthinkable.

Because that's like trying to give an answer without a formula.

But Herriot knows your story.

Royal Class 2-A, 1 Redina.

Talent is no-cast.

Call it a superpower, but Herriot has seen it happen.

Magic that manifests as soon as you think it.

If that's possible, what's not possible for you?

But you can't get superpowers.

Herriot worked to drastically reduce casting time, something many Battlemages have been working on.

Obviously, I didn't get any superpowers.

I just found a way to do it elsewhere.

At the Magic Institute, Herriot wracked his brains with everyone.

It wasn't Harriet who found the answer, but Louis. Louis Ankton understands magic, but can't use it.

As such, it has a different mindset than a typical wizard.

"Scroll magic can be cast instantly.

"That's right.

"A scroll is an enchanted piece of paper with a magic circle on it, right?

"Yes.

"But don't people already have magic in their bodies?

"Yeah, so?

"Can't I just draw a circle of magic on a person's body, assuming it's a scroll, and trigger it?

'......?'

"Huh?

Louis Ankton's response was that it was a bunch of nonsense.

But he wasn't exactly wrong.

Scrolls essentially require a magic circle to be drawn on an enchanted medium.

Enchanted Medium - Paper

Magic Circle - Formulas

It was a very intuitive understanding that if you put a human being as the medium and the formula on a human body, magic would happen. It was a bizarre argument that even Herriot, who had an intimate understanding of magic, had no clue about.

"Detomorian told me that the warriors of his tribe had their faces tattooed with the word Warpaint by shamans to draw on their extraordinary powers.

'I know witchcraft is the root of magic, but....... I don't know what that warpaint thing is, but it draws magic lines on people's bodies to draw power from them. What are you talking about?

"Yeah, I've heard it works, and if the warpaint harnesses the magic in a person's body, it's not all that different from what I was talking about after all, is it?

Louis was just saying. Using the human body as a scroll to reduce casting time, with the human itself functioning as a scroll.

It's too radical," Louis said, and Adelia shook her head.

"But assuming that works, if I can imprint a fireball spell circle and cast it, will that person only be able to use fireballs? If they try to use other spells, will they be able to use.......'

'I'm going to be covered in tattoos.......'

We all cringe, because even if we pretend, we know it's not going to be pretty.

And even if you did, you'd probably end up covered in tattoos if you tried to imprint all that magic on your body.

"And we can't learn scroll magic in the first place.

Christina said. The spells associated with the scrolls are top-secret and cannot be taught in the Temple, so whether it works or not, it's not something I can learn at this point.

"No.

But he shook his head at that.

"You don't need a magic circle, you need to imprint a 'language'.

Language.

Everyone was dumbfounded again by the noise.

"Once you've imprinted a language, there's a magical system that allows you to derive all sorts of magic just by putting together the right sequence of characters.

Once he said that, everyone knew what he was talking about.

Less ancient than witchcraft, but very ancient indeed, and the true source of magic.

"You just need to carve a rune.

With runes, you can create all the magic in the world.
