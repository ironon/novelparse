            Episode 448





A few days ago.

After breakfast, Herriot was taken to Riana's room and told a shocking story.

"Reinhardt is....... not?"

"Uh."

The Demon's Raid on Raziern, where Duke Granz was killed.

It hadn't been caused by a demonic attack, and she knew Reinhardt hadn't planned it.

"I found out a while ago, too. It was so weird to say the least, I think my mom kept looking into it."

"So you did....... Then....... What happened?"

"It was the Empire that killed my father."

"......what?"

Riana's mother, Duchess Yelena de Granz, was not on good terms with her husband, but she was not immune to the shock of his death.

Why the devil did it.

Why she had to die in that place, why her husband had to die.

The Duchess of Granz could not help but know her husband's proclivities and his character better than anyone else.

After a long and drawn-out investigation of her own, she found out.

What my husband has been doing.

Who, where, and what they were doing when they died.

Thus, we see that the devil had no reason to do such a thing.

Why the Empire is so unenthusiastic about investigating the case.

The circumstances made Duchess Yelena de Granz realize that this was an imperial stunt.

Then he told his daughter, who had gone mad with revenge against the demon.

The real enemy is not the devil, but the empire.

The Empire has killed Duke Granz and blamed it on the Devil.

There was nothing Riana could do.

While the devil is an opaque and powerful enemy, the empire is a clear and overwhelming enemy.

The prince and princess were classmates, and she could lay her hands on them, but Riana didn't want to settle for that.

I want to bring down an empire.

I wanted to kill my father, to peel back the thick veneer of empire from his impassive face at the funeral.

First, you need to build up your strength.

His own power is a force, but he must align himself with a force that can bring down an empire, or so he thought.

Then we learned that Reinhardt was the devil.

Shocking facts aside, Riana sees possibilities.

Together, you may be able to bring down an empire.

Reinhardt is about to die.

"I'm going to save Reinhardt at all costs."

When the demon dies, so does the possibility of empire collapse.

So instead of being shocked by the facts at hand, Riana focused on the first thing she needed to do to get revenge.

"Harriet, what are you going to do?"

Herriot was stunned by Liana's words.

That was the most incomprehensible and sad thing the devil had ever done.

The death of Duke Granz in the Raziern raid.

Even if he did have a reason, why did he have to kill Riana's father, even if it was a good reason, could he even understand it?

That's what Herriot was thinking.

But that was the Empire's own doing, and while we don't know what happened to the demonic raids that followed, we can be sure of at least one thing.

Reinhard has nothing to do with the death of Riana's father, Duke Granz.

If anything, they're being framed.

I didn't have a lot of time.

There is no telling when Reinhardt will be killed by the Empire.

I wanted to believe Reinhardt.

You don't need a lot of evidence to convince you of something you want to believe.

"I don't know how to do this, but......."

I believe because I want to believe.

I don't know how to do that, or if it's even possible.

It's just the two of you, you don't know what to do, and if you fail, you die.

"Me too, let's do it together."

Knowing it was an irreversible decision, Herriot decided to save Reinhardt.



* * *



And now.

Herriot and Riana's time was short, but they had a plan.

But when meteors begin raining down from the sky and the cries of an unidentified monster are heard outside the temple, they realize that something bad is happening.

I had to choose.

I wonder if this is because Reinhard is a really evil demon.

Should we trust Reinhardt despite this happening.

Liana chose the latter because she wanted revenge, and Herriot chose the former because he still believed Reinhardt was innocent.

Reinhardt, who had somehow managed to escape despite all his plans falling apart, joined Riana with Olivia Ranze.

Now that all of our plans had fallen apart, we had to improvise and react to every situation.

-Koooow!

A meteor slammed into the barrier above the Temple, sending a massive shockwave that shook the ground.

The pursuers are down, exposed to Riana's blast, but not dead.

He was still squirming and trying to get up somehow.

Herriot stretched out his hand, and the ground began to lift as if torn from beneath him, raining down on the knights of Shanapelle.

-Currrrrr!

In an instant, the knights were buried in the vomit, as if covered by a rocky mountain.

Bursting out of the alley, Herriot rushed over to Reinhardt, who didn't understand this sudden outburst from Liana and Herriot, and grabbed his hand.

"I don't know what's going on, but....... I don't know, but......."

Herriot was sobbing, both because the situation had gotten out of hand and because this was a living hell.

I believe in Reinhardt.

And from this moment on, you must part ways with everyone except those who are here at this moment in time.

Father.

Mother too.

Brothers.

Classmates.

She renounced her title as Grand Duchess of Saint-Thuan.

Leaving behind everything they had, everything they should have, everything they knew.

I'm betting on one thing: I believe in Reinhardt.

"I will....... I will believe you......."

He doesn't know if it's worth it or if he should be doing this.

"You were trying to save everyone. None of this happened....... that you didn't mean to do....... I'll believe that......."

I decided to take Reinhardt at his word that he wanted to save everyone.

So at a time when so many people were turning away from Reinhardt, Herriot decided to stand by him, hoping that she could be his strength.

"Let's go, Reinhardt."

Olivia leads the way.

Shanapelle's Swordmasters, buried in the rubble, could be heard breaking through the stone.

The real monsters are the humans.

Even when the world deserves to end, humans conquer the monsters and build civilization once again.

They deserve to be called monsters.

-Thump! Thump!

Humans are strong.

More than anything else in the world.

More than any other race.

Humans are the most frightening, humans are the strongest.

Temple fared better.

"Hey, but you, what the hell is going on, we had an idea, but now that things are like this, what the hell is......!"

Riana asked me, looking up at the meteor shower in the sky.

"Later, later!"

But I didn't have time for a conversation right now.

Meteors are raining down, but the temple's barriers are catching most of them, and students are running away screaming, but there are no monsters on the loose like outside the temple.

The knights of Chanapelle were after us again.

"Sis, pick me up!"

"Ace! Okay!"

Riana was the fittest, so Olivia nervously carried her along for the ride.

-Bang! Quack!

The Imperial Mages were casting offensive spells against us, but Herriot was able to deal with them.

If you run away, where.

Where to go and what to do.

I'm the devil.

Olivia, Riana, and Harriet will never be able to return to the world of humans again.

I couldn't help but think about it, even when I wasn't thinking about the future.

How the hell am I supposed to be responsible for them?

The good news is that all the combat-capable troops were outside the temple.

Since we couldn't climb over the collapsed building, we had to navigate around the blockage in real time, with Riana stopping the Swordmasters in their tracks and Herriot putting up a barrier there once again.

"@AndreaMcGee....... 허억......."

Herriot eventually reached the limit of his physical abilities, and it seemed like his body was starting to take a toll.

You only need to cross the temple gate.

You need to get over it, teleport away, and get somewhere.

If you encounter any of the Council's Lord Vampires outside the Temple, you will be able to escape the ecliptic via mass teleportation.

Will Sarkozy, Roussinil, Loyard, and Effinghauser be safe?

Obviously, this gate situation had to be caused by Elise.

I wonder if Eleris will be okay.

What was I thinking when I went live with Akasha, and how do I feel about it now?

All I could think about was the horrible things that had happened.

He somehow managed to fend off the pursuit and reach the main entrance to the temple.

We just need to break through that door.

I could see Ellen in front of him, wearing a cloak of flame and a saccharine sword.

"......."

Ellen Artorius was blocking the way for the four of us.

It's as if you're trying to be the head of the floodgates.

Ellen was blocking our path.

We don't know what path they took to get ahead of us.

However, Ellen stood in our way.

First and foremost, that sword.

I think it's lime, but it's a different kind of black than I've ever seen before.

"Get out of the way. Are you going to be the last one standing?"

Olivia grits her teeth and glares at Ellen.

Riana bit her lip and looked at Ellen.

In this moment, we all felt it.

No matter what the four of us do, we can't get past Ellen Artorius.

It was almost an instinctive gut reaction.

The magical enhancement around Ellen's body felt completely different than it did now.

How and when did Ellen become a Swordmaster?

But it was clear that if Ellen, clutching her blackened ramen, tried to stop us, none of us would be able to take her on.

Ellen's sword is stronger than Olivia's.

The Sun God's cloak will block Riana's charge.

Not even Herriot's magic would be able to penetrate Ellen's defenses.

Ellen has two-way resistance, so my words will not work.

Ellen looks at me with a calm expression.

Ellen, wearing the cloak of a sun god and a dark sword that looks like it's stolen a strand of night, looks at me and asks.

"Reinhardt. Answer me one question."

"......Say."

Ellen takes a deep breath and looks at me.

"What, you didn't get it?"

At those words, I felt a shiver run down my spine.

"You should have gotten it."

The other three don't know what you're talking about.

Only I know.

Rapelt, the cloak of the sun god.

Why didn't I get that?

"You should have gotten it, obviously."

If you're the devil, and you've been using me all this time.

I shouldn't have passed up the chance to have three holy relics.

That seemed to be Ellen's last question.

On this hellish map, where my minions are trying to destroy the world to save me, and meteors are falling on my temple.

When I'm pretty sure it was my men who caused it.

For the last time, Ellen seemed to try to believe me.

The four of us must leave the temple.

Probably, it won't come back.

I look at the transformed laments.

A sword forged in tears.

In his grief, Ramen has come to embrace an unidentified power.

It's a sword that looks like it can cut through anything.

If grief makes Ellen stronger.

If that's what it takes to survive this hell, this catastrophe of waking up too early.

Ellen wonders if she should be sad all the time.

No, beyond that sadness.

You should be able to hate me so much that you can use the true power of the Sun God's cloak, which is manifested in hatred.

If yes.

Should I deliberately lie to Ellen?

"I am......."

"No."

I started to say something. Ellen shook her head.

"Just, I don't want to hear it."

Ellen sees me.

"Again, I think you're trying to lie."

Ellen shakes her head, as if to say that she won't listen if it's too painful to hear.

"If that's the case, I'm not listening."

Ellen sees me.

No, his gaze was a little further away than that.

I looked behind me and saw the Swordmasters of Shanapelle closing in on me.

"Go, Reinhard."

Inflection points in history.

The inflection point in history that occurred when I didn't take the rappel. I could see it clearly now.

I should have been dead by now.

If you were given a lapel by Ellen.

I would be dead now, at Ellen's hands.

The fact that I didn't accept the lapel remained the last doubt in Ellen's mind.

It remained as something of a last hope.

Now, instead of killing me, it made me make a different choice.

When it was clear that my men had caused the catastrophe that brought the world to its knees, I made the choice to save the source, not kill it.

Ellen rushes past me, blocking the knights of Shanapelle from pursuing me.

"You....... What are you going to do......."

"It's okay."

Ellen stood in the way of the knights, gripping her sword.

"I'm not going to kill you, no one."

Against the Swordmasters of Shanapelle, Ellen says she won't die, but she won't kill them either.

As such, Ellen seemed to believe she could take them all down.

"So, go."

Will we ever meet again.

Is it possible.

If we meet again.

I wonder if it will ever be the same.

"From start to finish. It's all my fault."

I'm regretting it.

If you trusted me, if we had talked a little earlier, or before it all came to this.

This wouldn't have happened, or so I thought.

"I'm sorry I didn't believe you."

Just like I think that if I hadn't done anything, the gate wouldn't have happened.

Ellen says that if she hadn't done anything, none of this would have happened, and if she had trusted me, none of this would have happened.

He seemed to have the same kind of thoughts as me.

Finally, Ellen looks back at me.

Not just me, but Olivia, Riana, and Harriet.

Look at everyone once.

Even in this situation, I see people who believe in me and want to follow me.

Seeing others who have done something before you that you haven't.

"I am....... I don't deserve to like you."

They didn't believe me when it mattered most.

So here's what happened.

So Ellen seemed to have decided that I shouldn't even be allowed to have a heart.

With those words, Ellen sprints off toward the pursuing knights of Shanapelle.

We're leaving.

Ellen stays here, trying to stop the pursuit of me.

Live.

Me, too.

When and where we'll meet again, and under what circumstances, I don't know.

Even if a future where we point knives at each other is the only future we have left.

Until then, let's hope we don't kill each other.

I ran toward the entrance of the temple.
