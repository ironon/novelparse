The chains that bind the devil are no ordinary chains.

Essentially, chains designed to bind powerful criminals or fiends and similar things will block any magical attempts the captive might make.

casting magic.

Or disenchantment.

Or any kind of behavior that uses artifacts.

As such, he was unable to use any kind of power except his own physical strength, or psychic powers that he had no way of controlling.

And the many knights and wizards inside the prison would not stand idly by as the demon escaped.

Contingencies, tinkering with superpowers.

To prepare for the situation and hear the statement, Bertus was doing what he had to do.

-Pajik!

"Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!"

Bertus watched Reinhardt writhing in agony with his savior, Tana.

It's been about three hours now.

Reinhardt's eyes were bloodshot red, his whole body shaking, but he had withstood the magic without fainting.

-Bang! Bang!

-Ew! Ew! Ew!

And behind him, a gray-haired woman with a ponytail struggled.

They hadn't done anything magical, but they were feeling Reinhardt's pain as if it were their own.

Reinhard writhing in agony, the gray-haired woman weeping and weeping like an animal, writhing as if she felt her master's pain as much as her own.

How much time has passed.

Bertus watched as Reinhardt's body sagged as the pain ended.

The Archmage of the Imperial Mages, who had done so much magic, shook his head.

It wasn't worth the torture.

"Not a single mental trick is working."

"......Yes."

"I feel like I'm being protected by some kind of giant barrier....... It's as if you're under the protection of the gods....... I apologize, Your Majesty."

"Well, it's true that this guy was chosen by God. He's not wrong."

As long as we know that the demon has the power of speech, we can't ungag him. So we tried to break his mind, brainwash him, and get him to talk, but his spirit was strong.

As if protected by some great force, the demon's mind could not be penetrated or even cracked open.

"I'll ask them then."

Bertus pointed to the cage on the other side.

At that command, the door to the opposite cell opened, and Tana removed the gag from Loyar's mouth.

It was painful for Tana to see the tear-streaked trail of misery.

"What is Akasha?"

"......I don't know."

"That's a pretty obvious answer."

"......I don't know. I."

Loyar had been hiding from the full moon, so he hadn't been to Ritchie's tomb and knew even less about Akasha than the Empire knew.

"Let's see if your head is that hard. Go ahead."

"Yes, Your Highness."

The same psychic magic that had been used on Reinhardt was now being used on Loyaar.

-Pagic!

"Turn off ....... Ugh!"

Lyakhanslov's mental capacity was far beyond that of the killer.

But it's not the ubiquitous torture technician or inquisitor who's touching Loyar's mind right now.

Among the best mages among humankind, they are masters of the mental realm of magic, and have studied these areas exclusively.

An aging archmage who has no reason to dabble in the cruder things of direct torture, such as tampering with people's minds. He has mastered the magic of the mind, so to speak, that he has no reason to do this for the sake of trivial clinical data.

Loyar's spirit could not escape his touch.

"ugh, ugh....... ugh......."

Bertus asks in front of the gray-haired woman, whose mind has completely disintegrated, drooling at the corners of her mouth, and who is completely lost in thought.

"What is Akasha?"

"Infinitely....... collecting magical....... artifacts......."

Loyard tells the truth as he knows it.

"Collecting magic? I heard it can give you godlike powers?"

"I don't know....... I'm....... beyond that......."

Another keyword. Magic collection.

It's impossible to lie in this state of mind.

It's clear that this woman really doesn't know about Akasha.

Eventually, we need to ungag Reinhardt and get him to talk.

Bertus looked behind him, not at the gray-haired woman, who looked shaken and distraught.

"......."

While Loyard was being mentally tortured, Reinhardt was silent behind him.

But when Bertus saw Reinhardt, he couldn't help but be impressed.

Just as Loyard had wept at the sight of his master's suffering, Reinhard was weeping through his gag.

Those tears, they were red.

The pain, anger, and sadness that ordinary tears cannot express.

And despair ran through the corners of the demon's eyes.

As Bertus watched Reinhardt weep blood, he felt an intense, unexplained sense of dread.



* * *



The gray-haired woman doesn't know what Akasha is.

So, in the end, we have to ask Reinhardt.

Bertus left the stunned gray-haired woman behind and stood before Reinhardt again.

Bertus stares at the tear streaks of blood that run from the corners of the demon's eyes down his cheeks.

What Akasha is.

It was a simple question to ask, but the power of an unidentified spirit was too much of an obstacle.

"At this rate, I'll starve to death before I figure anything out."

I couldn't give him water or food because he was gagged to prevent him from using words.

You can't kill the demon until you know what Akasha is.

At this rate, the demon will dehydrate or starve before we can figure anything out, but if we force him to speak, he might try to do something with his words.

Necromancy is a superpower.

This is why magic can't cope with or prevent it.

Words.

Superpowers.

What to do about it.

"......."

In Bertus's mind, the name of the person he needed most right now popped into his head.

Immune.

Scarlett would be unaffected by Reinhardt's words now.

If so, no matter what happens, Scarlett has your back.



* * *



Scarlett, a second-year Royal Class B-3, has noticed that the atmosphere at Temple has been a bit turbulent lately.

Of course, I hadn't really noticed anything unusual. Stories of battles and demonic captures in the Darklands were highly classified, and rumors couldn't afford to get out.

However, the presence of far more Imperial knights and wizards than usual inside the temple, and the very somber atmosphere, were enough to make me realize that there was a dark cloud hanging over the place.

And best of all, a royal class atmosphere.

Charlotte didn't show up to class and wasn't even at Temple for some time, as if something serious was going on.

I don't know about Class A, but Bertus wasn't in class either.

But in the end, I don't know the full story, so I'm just going to assume that something is going on.

"It's ....... What?"

So, when Scarlett heard what Bertus had to say to her, she couldn't help but ask, "Why?

The explanation was long and wordy, but the bottom line was simple.

You've captured a demon.

And that's Reinhardt.

Scarlett couldn't believe her ears when Bertus, whom she hadn't had much contact with, said something so unbelievable.

Are you trying to make fun of me? Why? For what?

But Scarlett couldn't find the slightest hint of mischief in Bertus' expression.

Bertus was always subtly smiling and kind and gentle to all his classmates, even though we didn't know his true feelings.

But there was no way I could tell Bertus that I was kidding, as he spoke with a serious expression on his face, not the slightest hint of a smile.

"The point is, Reinhardt has some kind of psychic power that's hard to fathom, and what I'd call an interrogation isn't going well, so I need your help."

"ah......."

Scarlett couldn't make out what Bertus was saying.

But I could understand the implication that his immunity, an inscrutable superpower akin to a spirit, was necessary for the job.

Reinhardt is the devil.

You need your own help.

Scarlett nodded shakily, though she could understand nothing of what was being said.

"Yes....... If there's anything I need to do....... I'll do it......."

Bertus didn't add, but Scarlett understood enough to know that she wasn't supposed to tell anyone about this.



* * *



Bertus didn't tell Scarlett more than she needed to know.

Reinhardt is the devil.

The Devil uses a bizarre superpower known as ghosts, so if he tries to play tricks on Reinhardt with ghosts when he interrogates him, kill him.

It was a simple and straightforward instruction.

Scarlett arrives at a building inside the temple, which is guarded.

With so many knights and wizards around, the area around the building had a vast radius, and it was impossible to tell if there was a restraining order in place.

Reinhardt is the devil.

Having been chosen by the Alsbringer, Scarlet had grown to admire Reinhardt beyond admiration. But such a being was a demon.

I couldn't believe it when I heard it.

Even as Bertus led her into the heavily guarded basement of the building, Scarlett felt numb.

What's going on.

I wonder if I should be doing this.

What in the world is going on?

Biting her lip to keep from being eaten by fear. Scarlett soon found herself in a prison deep underground.

Scarlett didn't know if the Temple had originally housed a prison or if it had been hastily constructed.

The basement wasn't a huge space.

But all the knights and mages in the room remained silent, including Xaviorin Tana, the head of the Shanapelle.

Each and every one of them was a human weapon, one of the strongest in the world, and they stood their ground as if they would not tolerate any intruders.

But they all remained stony silent.

In that stifling atmosphere, Bertus handed Scarlett the canteen and food he had prepared.

We can't let it die, so we need to feed it something.

Scarlett accepted it with a shudder.

This is where Reinhardt comes in.

Reinhardt, who turns out to be a demon.

Scarlett walked slowly down the hall with Bertus, carrying a canteen and bread.

Halfway down a dark hallway.

There were bars and prisons on both sides.

Scarlet could see two beings in chains that must have been magically reinforced, even if they were pretending.

A woman with disheveled gray hair, hanging down.

And Reinhardt.

We weren't exactly close.

He's a pretty tough guy, but I thought it was cool that he always stuck to his guns and didn't bend to coercion.

I longed for that.

But the being was now reduced to a wretched figure, chained in the basement of the temple, awaiting judgment.

Are you the devil?

Why?

Why?

Faced with a grotesque absurdity, Scarlet watched as the stern-faced Savior Tana opened the cage.

Reinhard looked at Scarlett and said nothing.

As if we knew that Scarlett was a duck.

What does the red blood running down the cheek mean?

I wonder if I've been tortured or something.

"......."

Scarlett's fingertips shook violently as she removed the gag.

Scarlet couldn't comprehend that the devil who ravaged the world and the wretched, miserable Reinhardt in front of her were one and the same.

-Took

The gag in Reinhardt's mouth dropped to the floor with a thud.





Bertus asks.

"What is Akasha?"

At Bertus's question, Reinhardt opened his mouth as if he had been waiting.

"Akasha is....... tool of creation."

"It originally belonged to Cantus Magna, but at some point Darklands came into possession of it."

"The former Demon King Vali used Akasha to create a new world, so that he and his demons could migrate to it."

"And Akasha exists in the labyrinths beneath the Demon Castle."

"But it's probably moved now, and you won't find it, and I don't know where Akasha is anymore."

"I lost all memory of living in the demon world."

"So, I didn't realize I had Akasha until now."

"You're probably wondering what I want."

"I, Stretch....... Stretch, peace....... peace....... I wanted....... Hmph....... Heh heh heh......."

"May the world....... May there be peace....... Hmph. Hmph....... I hoped......."

"I don't....... I don't hate people......."

"You guys....... I wanted to save you all....... really......."

"Believe it or not....... Believe me......."

"Please...... I'll......."

Reinhardt says with a wry, wry smile.

Having said all that.

As if he knew no one would believe him.

Unable to control the laughter that leaked out.

Tell the truth about everything.

"If you don't believe me, then....... You guys need to let me go fast."

Reinhardt looks up with difficulty.

"Otherwise, Akasha might be used to destroy the world."

The demon, his eyes bloodshot, looks at Bertus.

"If you're not going to do that, at least do a public execution."

Like a madman.

"Before things get out of hand."

Scarlet could only stare in disbelief as the demon let out a low, mournful laugh.

"Hmph, hmph....... Hmph. Hmph, hmph......."

Reinhardt took no water and no bread.

Bertus narrowed his eyes at Reinhardt.

"That's ridiculous."

Bertus looked down at Reinhardt, who had bowed his head after he had finished speaking.

"If you already had something called Akasha, shouldn't you have used it, and what the hell was going on in Richie's grave?"

"......."

"You lost your memory, so you didn't know? What kind of lousy lie is that, now, are you mocking me, Reinhardt?"

"......."

"This is what happens when you realize that the head that used to work so well doesn't work anymore...it doesn't fit anymore....... A lie that's not even worth thinking about......."

"......."

"Suppose Akasha is a tool of creation, and your father, who you don't even want to believe, used it to lead demons to migrate to the Demon Realm, and you, too, for peace. Huh? Let's say that's what happened. Then, until now, you were Charlotte....... My brother. What did you do to my brother, what the hell?"

-Bam!

"Ugh!"

"You've done too many things to convince me that you wanted peace, don't you think?"

Reinhardt gulped as he kicked Ming.

Bertus was not logically wrong.

If he already had Akasha, why hadn't he used it until now? There must be more to what happened at Richie's grave.

If the library in the basement of the Demon Castle is Akasha, why have we left it alone all this time?

And what has been deceiving Charlotte all this time, that she was doing it to take over the empire, when she really wanted peace?

I've lost my memory.

So I didn't know everything.

It's a lie that doesn't even make sense.

Now that Akasha was actually in my hands, releasing it before it could be used for destruction was nothing more or less than something I said when I was cornered and had nothing else to say.

"And the power cartridges and moonshine you had the Ministry of Magic make, you know?"

"Oh....... Yeah, that happened......."

Reinhardt laughed at that, as if he'd just remembered.

"I thought everything you've done in the Temple so far was bullshit, so I dug it up, but you said it was already made, and then you made up a bunch of excuses and tried to hide your accomplishments."

"Yeah....... I did......."

Haha.

and.

Scarlett stared in horror at Reinhardt, who was grinning from ear to ear.

"I'm sure you're using it somewhere to grow your army. Aren't you?"

"Not....... Not at all....... Not......."

"Really? And what other excuses do you have for doing that?"

Bertus grimly grabs Reinhardt by the hair, forcing his head up and meeting his eyes.

"This time, I want you to think and lie."

The dead-eyed demon meets the prince's eyes, which burn with rage.

"I, in fact....... I know the future."

"......."

With trembling, cracked lips.

Reinhardt says with a laugh that is a mixture of despair, self-help, and heartbreak.

"In the future....... So....... At the beginning of the first semester next year....... A catastrophe called Gate is supposed to happen, and....... And then....... half the human race, no, more than half....... are supposed to be dying off......?"

"I....... to stop that from happening......."

"But we don't know why it's happening....... I don't know why....... I don't know either....... But I do know that it happens......."

"Even if I suddenly said something like that....... no one would believe me....... So, I searched myself for a reason....... A portal to another world....... I wondered if it was because he knew about such magical things....... Or maybe I could go to the other world first and do something about it....... I did all sorts of things....... I had Harriet study dimensional magic....... That's why I did it......."

"Power cartridges and moonshine are....... That's it. If I don't fix this....... we'll have to fight....... I need to see some of the things they're going to make in the future....... Let's make them ahead of time....... Let's give them a power boost....... It was something like this......."

"I was assuming that Cantus Magna would have something called Akasha in their possession....... I was assuming that Cantus Magna had Akasha by then....... Cantus Magna....... So the Sobriety Hunters are a group of people who are driven by magic for its own sake......."

-Bang!

Eventually, Bertus, who hadn't heard, slapped Reinhardt on the cheek.

"I told you to lie, and now you're writing a novel. Now you say you know the future?"

"Hmph, hmph....... Hmph, hmph, hmph, how....... how did you know?"

Reinhardt looks at Bertus, wide-eyed, with a grin that is nothing short of sobbing.

"This is fiction. It's true....... This world. It's a novel I wrote. How do I know the future? I created this world....... I created....... I'm the...... creator of it, or something like that....... Heh....... Heh....... Heh heh heh....... But....... I don't know everything, I only know a little....... Such an asshole....... Creator....... That's me....... Heh....... Heh heh heh......."

"You son of a bitch......!"

Bertus, his eyes rolling back in his head, roughly drew the sword Scarlet was wearing.

-Thwack!

"Your Majesty!"

"Woe....... Emperor!"

"Get off me, you fucking dog....... How far will you go to get me......!"

Tana quickly restrained Bertus from swinging his sword at her, and Scarlet went white in the face.

"Let go, let go, you son of a bitch, you're still messing with me!"

"Your Majesty! No, not yet, not yet!"

Reinhardt was laughing maniacally, even as he watched Bertus lose his temper.

"I know it's true....... What can I do....... I know this is true....... What can I do....... Hmph, hmph....... Hmph......."

The devil sobs like a madman.

"So....... You don't and can't believe what I said....... So....... So......."

The expression on the demon's face was wiped from his face as he laughed like a madman.

"Kill me now, before it's too late."

Scarlett could only watch in horror.
