The Duke of Granz Manor.

As soon as I walked into the outbuilding, rather than the main house, I was amazed.

First, the dining room of the outbuilding was filled with delicious smells.

Naturally, there was tons of food on the table.

But it wasn't the food that mattered.

"There you go."

Ellen.

"......."

Herriot.

"Wow, you're here......."

Adelia.

"Uh, um....... Hey, Reinhardt."

And Klippmann.

"This is all....... What is it?"

Not understanding the situation, Riana poked me in the side with her elbow.

"What the heck, you looked like you were in a bad mood, so I thought I'd do something for you, and then I said, "Let's go party.""

Well, food is food.

Everyone was wearing aprons, and the food seemed to be homemade.

It looks like I'm in a bad mood, but it doesn't tell me why.

So you want to console him somehow, but you don't know what to do, so you organize a surprise party or something.

It doesn't solve the problem, and it doesn't relieve my psychological anxiety about the task at hand.

The more I see these guys thinking like this, the more I fear for the future.

This is not useful for anything.

Because the better the present, the scarier the future.

This is the last thing I need.

Because there will come a day when you'll miss this moment.

"Uh....... Are you crying?"

Riana's shaky voice echoed through the dining room, breaking the silence.

He sounded genuinely confused, and the other kids looked at me, mouths agape.

"Crazy, what are you talking about, what did I cry about?"

"Oh, no....... You asshole, are you really crying?"

Riana fussed over what she'd seen.

Not the kids.

I'm way past the age of shedding a tear over something like this.

"I'm not crying!"

Would I cry!

They're not going to cry because you threw them a surprise party!

How old do you think I am in real life?

"......this."

Ellen walked over to me and held out a tissue.

No, I'm not crying, so why do I need this?

"You're not crying?"

I didn't cry.

I don't even know what came out of my eyes.

I don't know.

"Yeah, this because I know you're not crying."

Eventually,

Ellen takes the tissue she offers.

"Fuck......."

Something.

I wasn't defeated, but I felt defeated.

And.

There is such a thing.

A child who doesn't understand English and cries along when someone cries.

"black......."

"No....... You, why are you crying?"

"Oooh....... I don't know......."

Herriot suddenly cried along, causing Riana to freeze up for the second time.

"This."

"Ugh, ugh....... Black......."

Ellen handed out tissues to Harriet as well.



* * *



I didn't cry, but Harriet did. I believe so.

Of course, the kids think differently, but that's none of my business.

So in the end, it was a surprise party, but it was a sumptuous feast, so you're supposed to eat it.

It was never like a social party, with musicians playing songs and dancing.

Apparently, Riana doesn't like that kind of thing. I tried to imagine Riana dancing at a social party in a dress, but it didn't work out.

I'm guessing you're going to sit cross-legged and glare at the guys who come up to you and tell them to get lost.

Of course, we don't know what that would look like in practice.

There was plenty of food available.

Ellen, we learned last week that you can cook, but it was a surprise to see you do it with Harriet, Adelia, and now Cliff.

"Did you get dragged to ......?"

"......said they might be short-handed."

Apparently, Cliffman was given the name by Riana.

You've become a slave to Riana.

If it's actually a reward and you like it, I don't know, but if you really don't like it and you're being forced to do it, isn't this bullying?

No.

Calling it bullying is kind of funny at this point.

The question is, who made what?

-Omnomnomnom

It's Ellen, and I can't tell because she's eating whatever is in front of her.

-Cringe!

It's obvious what she's made. She watches me closely to see what I touch, and when I do, she looks at me expectantly.

But it's pretty interesting.

Creamy pasta in front of you.

From the looks of it, it must have been written by Herriot.

But honestly.

Because at a time like this, a character like you should definitely not be cooking.

Because it looks good, but it's actually sugar instead of salt, or something like that, right?

Eventually, I closed my eyes and took a bite because I knew I'd be disappointed if I didn't.

"What do you think? What do you think?"

Herriot asked, turning a color I was afraid to eat.

What is it?

Why not just be delicious?

It's not a huge delicacy, but thinking it was made by Herriot made it seem more delicious than it actually was because of the quirk correction.

"......Why is it delicious?"

Her eyes narrowed at my words.

"What the hell, if it's delicious, it's delicious, what do you mean it's delicious?"

"No, why do you think you know how to cook?"

"I just followed the recipe in the cookbook."

a.

Are you really saying that if you follow the recipe like a ruler, it can't be bad?

That's an honors student approach to cooking. In fact, thinking about it made me wonder if it's not possible for her to not be able to cook.

But this is the first time I've ever seen him do this. He's got some serious cooking talent, doesn't he?

The different types of food felt different.

This is pretty good, but Ellen did everything she wanted to do.

Pretty much everything I wanted to do was done by Herriot.

"......."

"......."

Some things were just plain tasteless.

"Well, it's my first time....... It's my first time, so......."

"No, this is the way it's supposed to be the first time. I don't think you're bad at it."

The Yoritsu property was taken by Adelia. No, it's not even a yoritsu. It's weird that she's so good at it.

Cliffman seems to have been in charge of preparing the ingredients and doing all sorts of odds and ends.

Eventually, the hearty meal came to an end.

"Anyway, thanks guys."

I expressed my honest gratitude for the fact that they had all gotten together to do this for a guy like me who was depressed.



* * *



The party didn't end there, though; we were at the Duchy of Granz anyway, and there were plenty of empty rooms, so we nodded our heads in agreement.

I don't have a particularly busy day right now, so I had plenty of time.

It's not the main house, it's an outbuilding, but it's almost as good as the main house.

Riana's thinking is obvious.

It's clear that you're trying to get the kids to drink too much tonight. It's broad daylight and people are watching, so it's not the right time yet, but it's clear they're looking for an opportunity.

It's also clear that they put us in the outbuilding to avoid the attention of the occupants and their families in the main house.

Of course, that doesn't happen until later in the evening.

"But it's winter break, and I want to go somewhere."

Riana muttered, filing her nails as she lay on her back with a slash across Cliffman's thigh.

Cliffman was frozen, unable to move.

At first glance, it should seem exciting and sweet.

Riana seems to think it's just a pillow substitute.

"Hey, man."

"Uh, uh, uh......."

Blushing, Cliffman stammered, unable to make eye contact with Riana as she looked up and called out to him.

"Do you want to go somewhere?"

"Me, me, me?!"

"So did I ask you or someone else?"

"That, that, that. That, that, that......."

"......No, why are you panicking?"

Riana looks up at Cliff and smirks.

"Oh, I thought you two were going to go?"

"Oh, no?! No, no. Ah, no. No. De?"

"Sneaky. Why, you want to go out with me, eh?"

"Oh, no, no, no, no!"

"What, no, no, no, now?"

"Oh, that, no, not......."

"Okay, you want to go out together?"

"Sa, help me....... My, my, I did everything wrong......."

Riana giggles at Cliffman's white-faced declaration of surrender, and Harriet is frozen in place as she watches. Herriot pats me on the shoulder and whispers in a low voice.

"Riana is a little....... Sometimes I see....... You know......."

"That's bad."

Her eyes widened at my words.

I wanted to say no, but he didn't end up saying no, so he seemed to agree with me strongly.

Adelia couldn't look at him with her eyes open, her face turning bright red.

-Omnomnomnom

Whether Ellen realized it or not, all she could think about was the macarons.

Aside from the prank she pulled on Klippmann, Riana did seem to want to go out before winter break ended.

Suddenly, there was a discussion about where to go for winter vacation.

As the conversation progressed, it was interesting to see that only Cliff, the human stutterer, reacted the most. It was more of a stutter, but he was the second most talkative after Riana.

As the story progressed, I honestly wasn't sure if I could go along, so I stepped outside to listen. In the name of taking a walk.

The fact that we are here as guests means that we have already reported to Duke Granz and are free to roam.

By the way.

Am I too much?

I'm at a friend's house, and it's polite to say hello to her parents.

Is that some kind of proof that I'm not completely out of Confucianism?

I'm not going to go out of my way to say hello to Duke Granz, because that would be ridiculous.

I wandered around the garden of the mansion, near the outbuildings.

It was winter, so there were no flowers, just a well-groomed shrubbery hedge.

To be able to have a mansion of this size on the Imperial Road was a reminder of the financial and power of the Dukes of Granz.

It's not like I don't have a daughter who spends money like Riana, and I have unlimited support.

If you think about it, in the original and now in our grade, those with strong backgrounds are almost all in the A class.

Bertus de Gradias.

Liana De Granz.

Herriot de Saint-Ouen.

Heinrich von Schwarz.

Erich is a nobleman, of course, but not a very powerful one.

Class B, on the other hand, has only one member of the nobility, Anna de Gerna, aside from Charlotte. Of course, she's more of a mage than a noble, so to speak, like Harriet.

Anyway.

Circling and circling and circling, we end up at Duke Granz's mansion.

Now that I think about it, Riana would have been happy to bring you over to see her house, so it's not like it's that far away.

So you're walking through a winter garden.

The last person you'd expect to see in a place like this was coming through the front door of the mansion, guided by you.

"Hmm."

"......a."

"Mr. Reinhardt, I never thought I'd see you in a place like this."

A middle-aged man removes his bowler hat to say hello.

"Ah....... It's been a while."

In this situation, in this place.

Why are you here.

It gave me goosebumps.

Merchant Guild Master.

Owen de Getmora.
