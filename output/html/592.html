            Episode 592.





Elendor had also gotten word from someone at the High Command that the Templars' graveyard had been robbed. Unsurprisingly, the leader of the Crusaders and a number of high-ranking paladins had returned to investigate.

With so much power concentrated in the Alliance, it's inevitable that the security of the Crusaders' anti-Crusader warfare will be compromised, and we don't consider the theft itself to be impossible.

What they didn't realize was that it was human remains that had been stolen.

"Why on earth would you want to......?"

It didn't make sense to Ellen.

"We don't know. But many of the cemeteries were destroyed, and all the remains in them are gone."

It's not like Elion Bolton can't understand it either.

"It was only natural that Archbishop Rowen would want to investigate this. But I didn't think it would involve capturing and torturing heretics."

Elion Bolton stared down at the table.

"I've been looking into it since I got back to the ecliptic, and I'm still cautious about acting on it, in case it's an internal disgruntled faction, in case there's something I don't know about."

How someone snuck into the cemetery of the saints and stole their remains.

We don't know why, we don't know how, and we don't know who.

And it's clear that the Crusader Commander can't trust those left in the Eclipse to even begin to work on the case.

"What the hell does that have to do with people in refugee camps?"

"You can't help but think that the job of an inquisitor is to capture, torture, and kill innocent people, but they are actually the most likely people in the world to see the curse rituals of pagans manifest in power."

"......."

They have seen enough of the demonic works of the pagans, and have seen the unholy miracles they perform.

So it's a bit of an occupational disease to think that pagans are to blame for these problems.

"It is by no means impossible that the curses and prayers of pagans might have desecrated the tombs of the saints."

Even the crusader leader can't say that the pagan rituals in the refugee camps were never the cause.

In fact, there is a huge refugee population in the ecliptic, many of whom are either martialists or believe in some variation of martialism.

It is impossible to say that it is not possible that some of their unclean rituals or prayers could have burned uncleanness into the mausoleums of the saints.

"Is that possible, really?"

To Ellen's question, Elion Bolton neither nodded nor shook his head.

"It could be a possibility."

The Crusader leader doesn't know what Rowen has been up to.

But we do know that Rowen was looking into the grave robbing, given what happened with the Crusaders.

Then you end up with a weirder problem.

"Why in the world would Ludwig go to......?

Ellen wondered if Rowen had approached Ludwig to get to her.

But if Rowen was investigating a grave robbery, what the hell does Ludwig have to do with it?

If the approach to Ludwig was for a different purpose than the grave robbery, it could be.

But is that really the case?

And another problem.

"Did Rowen have any idea why the Gate debacle happened....... Did he know?"

In hindsight, when I think back on what he said to Ludwig, Rowen seemed to know why the gate incident happened.

At Ellen's question, Elayon Bolton stares at her.

"That day, do you remember?"

Naturally, Ellen doesn't know what day it is.

The day the sky opened up and meteors rained down.

I'm talking about the day this whole nightmare started.

"Do you remember the people who were there?"

"......a."

There were a lot of people there.

The place where you ask the devil, one last time, what you've done and what you want.

There, the devil said.

I loved humans, and I wanted to save them.

But you guys didn't believe me, and it was too late, so I told you about what was going to happen.

The people who gathered to interrogate the demon that day.

Emperors and princes.

Ellen and Saviolin Tana, the Crusader Knights, and the Popes of the Five Great Houses.

And those who gathered to prepare for the what-ifs.

Imperial Mages.

Chanapelle.

Senior paladins of the Crusader Order.

"Archbishop Rowen was there, too."

Rowen was the one who had been there when the demon made his last excuse.

Give up everything, give up everything.

I said I loved you, I wanted peace, but you didn't believe me.

He had seen the devil in front of him, looking miserable, giving up on everything, confessing in despair to the car about what was to come.

Archbishop Rowen, the leader of the inquisitors, saw such a champion of Tuan and a despairing apostle of Tuan before his eyes.

He was a priest of Tuan.



* * *



On the day the heavens opened, there were many people in the great hall. There were mages from the imperial court, knights from Shanapelle, and high ranking paladins from the Crusade.

While many of them had already fallen into disfavor after the events of the Gate, others had survived. Rowen was one of them.

We don't know much about the demons, but we do know that they saw the Gate coming, and they saw it coming, and they saw how to stop it.

They're all holding back truths that shouldn't be revealed, but they're all human.

You can't help but suffer and wonder why this had to happen and what the hell went wrong.

Ellen could only stare in disbelief as she was told that the murdered Rowen had been one of those present that day.

At that moment, Ellen was in close proximity to the demon.

Rowen would have watched the scene from afar, one of the paladins guarding the perimeter in case of a possible attack.

She could hear the demon's confession.

Many people believe that the Gate was an act of the Devil to exterminate humans.

People hate Tuan for choosing such a demon.

Hate the priests who believe in such tuan.

I hate the followers of such priests.

And the warrior religion is on the rise.

How unfortunate, sad, and hateful it was to hear words of hate and anger spewed by people who didn't know the truth.

Ellen realizes that Rowen's hatred and dislike of her was perfectly natural.

But whatever Rowen wanted, whatever he investigated, he died.

We don't even know who died.

I don't even know why I approached Ludwig.

Louise said to Ellen.

Your work is humanity's work.

So, is all of humanity's work the work of a warrior?

Ellen eventually realized that beyond being suspicious of Rowen, she was also responsible for what happened to Rowen.

"You don't know who that person was killed by....... by whom he was killed?"

"......Yes."

The Crusader leader has only a vague idea of what Rowen was investigating. What she was really trying to do. He doesn't know who killed him.

You can't believe everything Elion Bolton said. It's entirely possible that Elion Bolton didn't tell the whole truth.

"Is it safe to assume that Rowen was killed while investigating a grave robbery?"

"Probably."

The Tomb of the Saints, in the basement of the Great Hall of the Crusader Knights, has been robbed.

Rowen was investigating the case and was killed for it.

That was the only conclusion I could come to.



* * *



Elion Bolton's claim that Rowen didn't know what he was doing is not entirely without credibility. However, that doesn't mean that everything Elion Bolton says is true.

No champion would want an outsider, Ellen, meddling too much in what was an internal affair in the first place, so it's no wonder they're hiding things.

The paladins were more concerned with covering up what the temple was doing than destroying the evidence because they were too scared to get to the scene. That's why the bodies in the temple's basement were left untouched.

The paladins were in a hurry.

Once the site itself was covered up, they would take their time dealing with the interrogation facilities for the inquisitors.

It was the Crusaders' business, of course, and the Empire had no reason to interfere.

If it weren't for Ellen's sudden intervention on the scene, the story would have ended with a publicized mob attack on the temple and a looting arson.

The scene was covered up by paladins under the direction of Elayon Bolton.

However, Elyon Bolton claimed that Rowen was not instructed to interrogate the pagans, and the claim itself is not without credibility, regardless of its veracity.

We won't know what's going on in the ecliptic until Elion Bolton returns, as he's obviously spending his time trying to figure things out.

Ellen ponders.

Does Elion Bolton know that Rowen intentionally approached Ludwig?

From the looks of things, Elion Bolton was focused on covering up the scene.

It was clear that he hadn't checked the contents of the papers inside the temple, or even realized that Ludwig had been intentionally approached by Rowen.

I would have covered it up and tried to figure it out as part of my apprenticeship.

And the document with Ludwig's face on it is now in Ellen's possession.

After debating whether or not to tell her, Ellen made a decision.

I still don't trust Elion Bolton.

He won't trust Ellen either, so it's a mutual distrust.

"You don't mind if I figure it out on my own, do you?"

If he tells her to stay out of it, she'll be suspicious.

Ellen does not explicitly have any public power, such as investigative powers.

However, because it is unspecified, Ellen can interfere with anything in the world.

Ellen's ability to meddle in the affairs of the Crusaders where even the Emperor cannot is proof of that.

In some ways, it is Ellen who has the most transcendent power. She doesn't know what Elion Bolton is thinking.

It's just that he knows he can't resist.

"I will cooperate fully, but only within the authority of the Crusader Knights."

Within the authority of the Crusader Commander.

Ellen understood enough to know what he meant.



* * *



After her meeting with the crusader leader, Ellen returned to where her group was waiting.

Ellen was assured of the Crusader's full cooperation. However, the Crusader made no mention of the princess of the House of Schwarz.

It's unclear whether this means that she should do her own thing, or that it's okay for Louise to have a foot in the door.

However, the crusader leader must solve a case of grave robbing.

It wouldn't hurt for Ellen to handle this in her own way, just as Rowen handled the case in his own way.

Elion Boulton was ambiguous about whether he really didn't know, or whether he knew but wasn't saying.

But the idea that he could not possibly be ignorant of the zodiacal situation was not without merit.

Ellen didn't bother to mention that Rowen was one of the people who knew the truth about the Gate situation.

I feel guilty, but the truth that must be hidden must be hidden.

Just as Elayon Bolton had paved the way down to the basement of the Inquisitor's temple with rubble. Ellen was bound to do something similar.

"The cemetery was robbed, and it's the remains that are missing?"

"Yes."

"Why on earth would you want to......?"

"I don't know."

The three were understandably surprised to hear about what Rowen was supposedly investigating.

If the treasure is missing, it's probably for a bath, but if the remains are missing, it's more likely that they were involved in something nefarious.

As an inquisitor, it would have made sense for Rowen to investigate the evil ones, the pagans.

In the refugee camps, those who appeared to be heretics were captured, tortured, and killed to determine if they had any connection to the Crusaders' grave robbing.

Whether it was justified or not, she did her job.

Disappeared remains.

Why did they steal the remains of the saints and where did they go?

Louise narrowed her brow in thought.

"Interrogating and killing infidels seems to have been the only conclusion the priest could come to......."

"Then we found the alleged culprits, and the best we can hope for is that he was killed by them......."

"But are there enough pagan forces in the refugee camp to do something like that?"

It's impossible to say that it can never happen.

But there's one piece of the puzzle that doesn't fit together: if Rowen eventually crossed paths with some powerful cult in the refugee camp and was slaughtered by them and their inquisitors.

All eyes naturally turn to Ludwig.

"Then why on earth would I want to......."

Ludwig was also confused because he couldn't figure out why Rowen had approached him.

"One thing's for sure, he didn't need a bodyguard, and I'm pretty sure he made a deliberate approach to you."

Rowen must have been more skilled than Ludwig. It's clear that he came to Ludwig's guard on purpose, even if it was only under the guise of needing protection.

But Ellen was beginning to wonder if these were two separate incidents.

Rowen was investigating the whereabouts of the missing remains.

He wanted to reach Ludwig so that he could reach Ellen in order to eradicate the Mercenary Order.

He's a guy who's supposed to hate infidels, so he could have been working on two completely different things.

Once Ellen realized the premise that Rowen was someone who had some knowledge of the truth about the gate, she came to a different conclusion than everyone else in the room.

Ludwig's involvement is separate from the paganism and theft of human remains.

The theft of the ashes is a matter of immediate concern to Rowen, and he has no choice but to investigate.

Approaching Ellen through Ludwig would be a completely different endeavor for Rowen, who has been in the game for quite some time.

Given the circumstances, Ellen was convinced that Rowen had no choice but to hate her.

But in the end, no matter what Rowen tried to do, the problem comes back to square one.

Who killed Rowen?

"Is there a refugee camp in....... with a cultist force of that size, could they possibly have the strength to storm the Inquisitor's temple?"

At Ellen's question, Louise was silent. As if she couldn't think of anything.

Heinrich von Schwarz, who had been thinking about it, but had been silent because he couldn't think of anything to say, spoke up.

"I wonder if Demon religion is....... maybe?"

"......magic?"

Real heresy, not paganism.

"Yeah, there's a lot of paganism in the refugee camps, there's no way there's not some kind of necromancer."

In reality, Demonists use true demonic power, unlike their half-hearted warrior counterparts.

In practice, the dangerous heresies have always been the magicians.

"Yeah....... I hadn't thought about that one."

Louise nodded slowly.

While the theft of the ashes was not the work of Satanists in the refugee camps, in the grand scheme of things, Heinrich's reasoning was true.
