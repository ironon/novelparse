            Episode 397.





Olivia's conclusion was not unique. Even when people are in a state of panic, those who are able to think calmly can reason from the list of victims.

But that's not all, they raided a Merchant Guild branch, wiped out a bunch of powerful Imperials, and vaporized. Maybe demons don't need a good reason to kill powerful people in the Empire.

You can terrorize people by showing them that even the most powerful people can be targeted.

So Olivia's reasoning now falls within the realm of what Special Branch investigators, who don't know the truth about the Raziern raid, can figure out.

"In fact, not only were the powerful men who died there, but their escorts were all highly skilled. Not a large number of escorts, but an elite few. The core of the demons' power is missing here."

"I guess so."

"But there's no sign of large-scale destructive magic being used this time, though I suppose it's possible that veterans of melee combat were involved....... If so, it's either proof that the demons are not a minority, or they've grown in strength....... The appearance of hitherto unseen orcs and goblins suggests the latter."

Orcs, goblins, ogres, and trolls.

Olivia seemed to ponder the possibility that the demons had increased their power just by displaying power they hadn't been sending before.

The suspicion that this might not be the work of demons, but of someone else, seemed to elude Olivia, and rightly so.

Even Olivia, who is as disappointed as a human can be, has a limit to her thinking. If I weren't a demon myself, I'd probably have kicked a few tongues out of the demons' mouths at the idea of something like this happening. If I hadn't been a demon myself, I might have thought that there were some suspicious circumstances, but there are so many suspicious things in the world.

I'm sensitive and serious about it because it's my job. If it were some other faraway place, I'd let it go in one ear and out the other. Even if it was about the devil.

"If the demons attacked to wreak havoc on the Empire, they succeeded, and by sending them not only here, but also to Raziern, they've also shown us that their true power is far greater than we expected."

A significant number of suspects were killed, and a horde of demons attacked Raziern, though they were unable to do any significant damage.

That in itself is already a protest of sorts.

We have enough elite and regular troops. And that we can mass teleport them anywhere in the Empire to wreak carnage instantly.

I didn't actually do it, but that's probably how people and law enforcement are taking it.

"The question is, how did the demons know that so many important people would be at a meeting of this branch of the Merchant's Guild on that day, at that hour?"

Information. Naturally, it's unlikely that most people knew such a meeting was taking place. But the demons knew, and they attacked.

That was because the Merchant Guild Master was a traitor, and it was the Imperials who carried out the raid. We can only assume that Shanapelle was in charge.

Where did the demons get their information?

"The last Crusader raid, and maybe it's just me, but the demons seem to know a lot of secret information."

That was thanks to Radia Schmidt's bullshit, but it was still important information. To the uninitiated, it's easy to think that demons know everything.

"So for now, I think it's best to find out why there were so many people in that Merchant's Guild branch, maybe there was an inside track."

What on earth was this meeting about that had brought so many people to this small southern merchant guild chapter?

Olivia was focused on that.

And then there's the leaker, who, although I can't quite put my finger on it, is closing in on Owen de Getmora.

The more Olivia said this, the more complicated my thoughts became.

Why the hell did Saviolin Tana send me here?

The Special Investigations Unit here was never set up to investigate, it was set up to obscure the truth. Not all investigators know the truth, but at least Scotra Kelton, the head of the unit, does.

The imperial instructions to him would naturally be to cover up the truth.

The Empire intervened to prevent the royal family of Levaina from investigating on their own.

The conspiracy to fabricate an imperial demon attack is not over, but it is still ongoing, as it will end the moment this division closes the case.

So no matter how the investigation goes, the end result will be that it was the work of demons. If the royal family of Levaina tries to intervene in the investigation, the Empire will use any excuse to prevent it, and Levaina has no reason to reject the Empire's personal attention.

This organization was set up to solve cases, but to do so at will. This conspiracy is riddled with suspicious circumstances, but once an agency closes a case, there can be no further investigation, so the final step in the conspiracy is to close the Special Branch's investigation.

But me and Olivia are different. We're the ones who have the power to deny the royal family access to Levaina, but they can't tell me or Olivia what to do.

A normal student would say, "Where are these kids going?" but Olivia is like that, and I'm like that, and I can't treat her like that.

Soon.

We could end up getting to the bottom of it, completely unaffected by their investigative guidelines or intentions. They can't tell us what to do.

"We've checked everything we need to check in the field, so let's go to the Merchant's Guild tomorrow."

"Yes, sir."

Why?

I don't care if me and Olivia ever find out the truth, is that it?



* * *



Tomorrow, Olivia and I will visit the Merchant's Guild headquarters in Raziern.

It was late, so we decided to go to bed early, and Olivia and I went to our respective bedrooms.

But there's a strong possibility that she won't get anything out of it and will only raise suspicions. In that case, we don't know what Olivia's next move will be.

I know the truth, and I can find out as much as I want. I don't need to look anywhere else, I just need to go straight to the ecliptic and meet Owen de Getmora.

A very important meeting has taken place in the south, gathering such powerful people. Why were you, the Guildmaster, not present at such an important meeting?

If you start with something like that and start weaving Owen in, you might get him to admit the truth, but you might also get him to admit that he's suspicious enough to be caught.

Here's the thing.

A very large imperial conspiracy is to be uncovered by the Imperial Investigation Agency. That doesn't happen.

If Olivia ever found out the truth, she would get no credit. Rather, her hatred of humans would build and build.

So I don't want Olivia to find out the truth here, or to believe the fabricated truth.

That's why I'm curious about Savior Tana's thoughts. Why she sent me here to help Olivia, when it's clear that this place isn't dangerous.

You can add at least one to your resume. I helped investigate the location of the demon attack, that's all. Of course, being a member of the Special Investigation Unit for the Demon Attack is a pretty big resume, so it can't hurt.

It's a parachute career, so to speak. I can take any number of low-risk, high-reward positions, and my reputation builds as I go. The Empire doesn't want me to be dangerous, so I'm sure they'll want me to roam these places.

It's a little hard to avoid becoming a manufactured hero.

I'm lying in the bedroom of a royal family member and my mind is racing.

I think it's a good thing Olivia wasn't too hurt when she heard about the engagement.

I went out into the living room to get some water.

-black....... gray.......

Very low, sobbing cries came from Olivia's bedroom beyond the closed door.

Yes.

It can't be good.

In the first place, you're the only one crying.

The person who used to wear a smiling mask all the time, now wears an angry mask all the time.

Olivia's natural inclination to never let anyone see her struggle will never change.

This was hard for me to swallow, so I tried to trust what I saw.

Olivia laughs, even though I know she's always been that way.

I tried to believe he was actually smiling.

-Ugh....... ugh.......

What the heck should I have done.

I.

I couldn't tell anything.

-Eavesdropping on people crying, that's mean.

Of course, Olivia, whose senses are sharper than mine, heard me open the bedroom door and said so from the other side of the door.

-I know you can't come over and give me a hug, but you can give me a pat on the back, silly.

As I stood there, I could hear Olivia's pining from across the bedroom.

After wondering if I should go, I opened Olivia's bedroom door.

I was surprised that it wasn't locked as a matter of course.





When I walked into the bedroom, I found Olivia on the bed, wiping the corners of her eyes.

"I hope it's real, my eyes are shining."

Blindfolded, Olivia says, "I'm not sure.

"No what....... what?"

I can't do this, I can't do that. Olivia lowered the arm that covered her eyes.

I say poured, but honestly, I'm not sure.

In the darkness, I could just make out his slightly slit eyes in the moonlight streaming through the window.

"You're not going to marry me, are you?"

"......."

"You don't even have to say anything. I feel so bad for you."

With that, Olivia pushed herself up slightly and leaned her back against the wall behind the bed.

Olivia wasn't looking at me.

Pouting, Olivia stares out the moonlit window.

"I'm just going to marry the devil?"

"Is that ......?"

"Since you won't look out for me for the rest of my life, I'm going to marry the devil and then put a knife to your throat, you bastard."

Sister.......

It's true....... That's me too.......



* * *



Olivia was joking, but that doesn't mean she wasn't serious. I don't know if she really wants to side with the Demon King. But I think she came to the Kingdom of Levaina because she wanted to know if the Demon King was truly as evil as the world perceived him to be.

Of course, I thought it was funny that she'd never seen a demon, and yet she was talking about marrying a demon as if it were a real thing. I mean, what if demons are genderless, dimorphic monsters?

......No.

I'm a little scared that Olivia will say what the hell does it matter if she's serious.

The next day.

"I don't know the details."

When Olivia and I arrived at the Merchant's Guild chapter in Levaina, we were able to get the story from the chapter leader.

"It would have been a major undertaking for the guild, but in those cases, we don't tend to share information with lower branches like this, just give them a venue. It's not that uncommon, so it's not like......."

From the look on his face, it was clear that he knew nothing about the Levaina Merchant Guild. Olivia stared at her, too, and then nodded.

"I see."

By the way she complied, I don't think Olivia was expecting to get any information from this.

Each of the dead was a major figure in the Empire, from all walks of life. And since the Merchant Guild's business was so important in the first place that information wasn't spread far and wide, Olivia didn't see much reason to doubt what the head of the Raziern Merchant Guild's branch was saying, and neither did I.

Olivia asked the branch manager a few more questions, but didn't get any significant leads.

But important.

That the Merchant Guild headquarters has ordered you to leave the branch empty because they will be using it for a specific period of time.

He was merely following the instructions of his headquarters in Raziern's branch.

"Let's get out of here, Reinhardt."

"Sure."

Olivia left Raziern's branch as if that was enough.

Outside the Merchant's Guild branch, Olivia pressed her index finger to her cheek and shook her head.

It's kind of pissing me off because she's trying to be cute and she's actually cute.

"It's kind of weird that the place was rented for a specific period of time, not a specific date......."

"The meeting could have been for multiple days, and even if it wasn't, you'd still have to clean up after them and take care of other things."

"Hmmm, that's true, I've never met anyone who wasn't a farting mess."

Olivia would have had quite a few meetings with people in high places, even if not now. So it makes sense to me that they would order her to leave for a period of time, not just a specific date.

"There were quite a few priests like that."

"......Priests, too?"

"Yeah, I've heard of some high priests who insist that their prayer space be exactly how they want it, and they drive around in a huge carriage decorated as a chapel. I've heard of some who insist that their sermons aren't for the common people, and they won't let anyone below the rank of ordained priest hear them. There are some people who think they're two or three levels above where everyone else sees them. It's kind of like they deify themselves, which is kind of funny."

The sneer that remained in her ponytail reflected Olivia's contempt for humans.

"Low is low, high is high, and I'm ugly in my own way."

The ugliness that comes from ignorance and lowliness, and the ugliness that comes from knowledge and honor.

Humans are ugly, Olivia seemed to think.

"In that sense, my foster father was a good priest, because he had integrity. It's just that he was crazy."

As disappointed as he was with everyone in the world, he felt that his adoptive father was still a madman who followed his convictions, which was better than most.

Levereer Ranze sought to break away from the Empire and establish the Empire of the Five Great Houses, and with his first great success, he attempted to install Olivia.

It was only as he lay dying that he realized that the gods had never chosen him, and he accepted death. He understood that by killing him, he had earned Tuan's judgment, for he was Tuan's champion.

Olivia looked off into the distance and smiled bitterly.

"That's useless, let's go back to the ecliptic for now. The Merchant Guild Master might know something."

"......Yes."

I knew who to turn to because I knew the truth, but Olivia's thoughts naturally drifted there as well.

Is it really okay for Olivia to see Owen?

If Olivia knew the truth, she would inevitably be in danger. Olivia is an unknown, but she is a champion of Tuan, just like me. But the Empire doesn't know that.

I'll be okay, but will Olivia be okay? But an empire short of people will not want to sacrifice Olivia, who is far stronger than me or Ellen at this point. Especially if they realize that she shares Tiamata with me.

With that thought in mind, I head for the warp gate in Raziern.

-It's their fault!

-They brought the demons!

-Kill! Kill!

There was a commotion in a square in Raziern.

"What's going on?"

"Sure."

It was crowded, and people were being pushed and shoved by the guards.

-Kill the Satanists!

-Kill the infidel!

-Fetch the inquisitor!

"Demon religion......?"

Olivia's expression hardened, and so did mine.

The word I'd long forgotten, but was clearly in the back of my mind.

Demonology.

The name was echoing through the center of Raziern.



* * *



In the middle of the square in Raziern, someone was being mobbed by a cultist.

-Get away! I said get away!

The man who appeared to be in charge of the guard was cursing, but the angry crowd was cursing back and trying to push the guard away. Olivia and I could see people sprawled out on the ground inside the circle of people the guards had formed.

There was nothing in their demeanor that identified them as Satanists because I don't know what Satanists are in the first place.

They just looked like normal people. Young men, women, old men. There were even children.

No matter how you looked at it, they seemed to be just normal people.

-Soon, the Inquisitor of the Five Great Houses will take the proper steps to determine whether or not they are demonists! Those who use private means will be severely punished according to the laws of Levaina!

-How many people have heard them get together and talk about the devil!

-What the hell is a bunch of housebound bastards worshipping a strange idol if not Satanism!

-Kill him! Kill him! He'll come back for more!

-If they bring the demon back to Raziern, you'll be responsible!

Olivia's expression hardened as she looked at the crowd.

"Something happened that you don't understand, so you decided to hate the people around you that you do understand."

"......."

"Isn't that funny, Reinhardt?"

Olivia smiles at me.

"It's the demons who killed the people, and the humans are trying to solve something by killing the humans."

I wonder if the Olivia of old would have helped those persecuted.

They may or may not be Satanists.

However, an event begets many events.

The people of Raziern, the capital of the Kingdom of Levaina, don't trust the investigators sent by the Empire; they trust their instincts.

-They're going to bring the demons back!

The Devil has no reason or justification to answer their call, even if they are indeed Satanists.

How in the world can you lowly creatures, not unlike yourselves, summon a demon to this small town?

But people believe it.

To believe it.

-Oh, look down upon us, O Great God.......

They believe they are doing good because they think killing them is justice.

As such, there seemed to be little awareness that this was murder.

Olivia was laughing at the humans.

I didn't want to laugh at the sight, to be disgusted by it.

"That's sad."

Olivia smirks in surprise at my comment.

"I'm surprised, Reinhardt. You have such humanity."

"Life is too good to be precious."

"....... I guess."

For a moment, I wondered if the devil and the saint had gotten their words backwards.

Olivia stopped laughing at the horrible sight at my words.

"Let's go. This is unpleasant."

However, he didn't seem to have the slightest inclination to intervene in the spectacle.
