Central Palace Tetra, the Emperor's office.

"You've been playing with ......."

Herriot and Reinhardt arrive first thing in the morning.

That was all Charlotte had to say to Herriot and Reinhardt.

Charlotte's sarcastic response made both Herriot and Reinhardt blush.

"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

Marriage.

As Reinhardt argued yesterday, it should.

There's no such thing as a "no" option.

It's just unclear how many more people we'll be working with.

Charlotte was fully aware of that and was thinking that maybe she should do more than just agree.

"You'll have to do it with me, you'll have to do it with Olivia Ranze, you'll have to do it with Airi. It's going to be awkward, but I might even be forced to do it with Riana. It's not like I don't have to make up people and force them into marriage alliances......."

"What are you talking about, Lee, not Riana!"

"Why not, I'll do it if I have to."

Reinhardt freaked out, and Harriet began to blush.

"Well, still....... But......!"

"You're trying to cover for work, now, for your own good?"

Reinhardt froze as Charlotte's expression turned cold.

With that said, Reinhardt may now have to marry someone who, for better or worse, he'll probably want to die of hate.

So Reinhardt doesn't have a choice in the first place.

If you do it, you do it; if you shouldn't, you shouldn't.

"That, that's....... That is....... but......."

"Well, Riana was just saying, you don't have to go that far. Anyway, you have to get married. A lot."

Charlotte didn't say that Reinhardt was fooling around because he said he was going to marry you.

The part about Charlotte playing and falling asleep is different.

Charlotte's icy gaze is directed at Herriot, not Reinhardt.

"But what, you want to go first?"

"Well, then....... Then why not?"

At Charlotte's words, Harriet added cautiously.

Marriage.

I'll put up with this guy doing that.

But I want you to be the first to do it.

It's Herriot's last ditch effort.

"Marriage is a matter of state, did I just say that?"

"Well, it was......."

"It's a state 'event,' right?"

"Uhhh......."

"Surely an event has a 'cost', right?"

With that, both Herriot and Reinhardt had no choice but to realize what Charlotte was talking about.

"How many times can we do that on our terms? You want to take care of your own wedding and then fuck up a country that hasn't even started?"

"Well, for short......."

Charlotte's face twists at Reinhardt's cautious words.

"......If the wedding of the new Emperor of the New Empire is held in an abbreviated ceremony, will it be rumored that it is a frugal empire or an extravagant one?"

"......He, he, he? Go?"

"Luckily, the times are such that it would be flattering to have such an event on a grand scale. There's nothing wrong with a small one, but the reason the Emperor's marriage is a state event is that it has a pre-marital purpose: to announce the union of power with power, not the union of an individual with an individual. The purpose is to publicize it. If an emperor or a king were to marry in a small, secretive ceremony, with only a few people in the know, do you think that's some kind of espionage?"

Charlotte sighed, as if just thinking about it was giving her a headache.

"How many years do you think it will take to have a proper wedding with each and every one of them?"

"I don't know, but......."

"Once the country has recovered to a point where the emperor's wedding doesn't affect the national economy?"

"You know that thing about getting married and dying of old age....... something like that?"

"I know."

Charlotte looks at Herriot and Reinhardt with a cold stare.

When I say we'll do it first, I mean we'll do it separately.

We're not in a position to do that.

"Well, good. You spoke first, so I'm going to clean this up now."

Charlotte pulls out a blank piece of paper and begins to scribble something down.

Charlotte finished writing in a flash and handed the paper to Reinhardt.

And, of course, it had a person's name on it.

"Notify and come."

"Notification......? What notification?"

"......Why don't we stop playing dumb?"

Charlotte looks like she's about to get really angry, and Reinhardt frowns.

"No, I mean, right now....... to announce your marriage to these people? Right now?"

Reinhardt squinted at the names on the papers.

Charlotte shakes her head at Reinhardt and Harriet, who look puzzled.

"I thought you two were getting married?"

"Uh, uh, uh......."

"You said you'd do it with me."

"Uhhh. What....... Uh-huh."

"I thought you said you were going to do it with other people?"

"Uh......."

It's a marriage you're going to have anyway. And it's a marriage you're going to have a lot of. And they understand and accept that.

And doing it separately is very difficult in the current environment.

So what's the problem?

"Well, I'm going to do it anyway, so let's do it all at once."

All at once and.

Herriot and Reinhardt's jaws dropped slightly at that.

"Oh, no....... That's......."

Charlotte smiles wryly at their expressions.

Charlotte points a finger at Reinhardt to visit.

"If you do, go forward to the people listed there."

"We're getting married in the same place, at the same time, on the same day."

"Let's make the day of the ceremony Independence Day."

"Specifically, tell that to Olivia Ranze."

"If you want to grow old and die eating your own wedding, say no."

Charlotte's bold decision to hold the wedding and the inauguration at the same time made both Harriet and Reinhardt realize that something was not quite right.

But even so, it would be a pointless drain on the treasury and not feasible to organize multiple marriages of the emperor in these troubled times.

The economy will collapse because of the wedding.

Charlotte's decision is economical and rational.

It's only a problem because it's dehumanizing.

When Reinhard and Herriot come to discuss the future Emperor's marriage plans, they are told that they want to be separated.

Is it just you guys? We're all getting married at the same time.

That's Charlotte's answer.

"No....... But......."

"Well."

"No matter what......."

Obviously.

Reinhardt's gaze was fixed on one of the names on the papers, and he couldn't leave it.

Charlotte's expression turns cold as she watches Reinhardt freak out.

"What did I just say to you, marriage?"

"I said national security."

"Do you want to take a leave of absence?"

The new emperor, who had come to talk about marriage and was given a list of people to marry, left the office as lonely as if his soul had left him.

Charlotte smiled at Harriet, who was equally flustered by the storm.

It was a sneer.

"Hmmm, if we were in better financial shape, we could have had a monopoly for a year or so. Too bad, huh?"

"......what."

Harriet's face turned even redder at Charlotte's nakedness.

"You're an asshole. But hey, you deserve it."

"......."

Heriot knew this was inevitable if he was going to be emperor, not just king, and Reinhardt had even told him so himself.

But neither Reinhardt nor Herriot expected it all to come at once.

However.

The reason for Reinhardt's pale complexion.

"Uh, by the way....... Is that okay?"

Herriot had seen the name on the slip of paper, too, which is why he was so pale.

This is a bit of a stretch.

Because it had a name like that.

"It's a job, I have to do it, what are you going to do, is this the end of it, I might have to do it three or four more times depending on the situation."

Not three times, not four times, but three or four times.

We don't know how many more marriages we'll have.

Sure, it's necessary.

It's not like you didn't have a sidebar that said, "Kick the shit out of him.

"What do you say we sneak around and watch?"

"Well, don't do that!"

Charlotte chuckled for a moment, trying to imagine the scene.



* * *



On the orders of Charlotte de Gradias, the de facto acting emperor, the new emperor Reinhard wandered aimlessly through the central palace, the Tetra.

You need to get married.

A lot.

Frequent.

Quite a bit.

I don't know about you, but when you're an emperor, that's what marriage is supposed to be.

I knew it, and I knew it was something I had to do.

But all at once, without being prepared.

All of them.

The emperor didn't see it coming.

The first person the emperor turned to was Olivia Ranze.

"......."

"......."

By the time I finished my half-dead, gibberish-like explanation, Olivia Ranze's face had turned grim.

"I've often thought about how I might not be able to marry you, but I never thought I'd do it this way. In a group? What is that?"

This is the look of someone who is really upset and wants to break something.

Olivia Ranze hadn't been sober in a very, very long time.

"I'm going to tinker with the doctrines of the Church anyway, and I'll be able to make my own decisions once I'm married."

Once we realize that earrings are earrings and nose rings are nose rings, and that it's the gods and the doctrine, we can get rid of the practice of not allowing pure priests to marry.

Reinhardt was on the edge of his seat, wondering if he was going to get a big slap.

Olivia studied Reinhardt's expression.

"You're sorry, aren't you?"

"......."

"Why are you sorry? Actually, you should be, right? It's just that I'm in a bad mood, and there's nothing you can do about it......."

It's like fate after all.

"Ha ha....... Yeah. I suppose it's a good thing it's going to be like this and no one dies, because we shouldn't be too greedy....... And if I refuse now, I might just die of old age......? Is that some kind of unspoken threat?"

Olivia frowned in displeasure at Charlotte's message.

If I say I'm going to do it separately, I might do it later when I have more time.

"By then, the kid will have already been admitted to Temple......."

Olivia seemed to imagine what would happen if she didn't accept the offer.

It's not something you can do because Olivia says you shouldn't, and it's not something you can do because she says you should.

But you can't help but feel bad.

They say it's inevitable.

Olivia Ranze is in a very bad mood right now.

"We'll see how they do."

Olivia Ranze looks at Reinhardt with a cold gaze.

You say you can't do anything about it now.

"The next time you make me feel bad, I'm going to make you regret being alive, do you understand?"

"That, that....... Okay......."

Olivia Ranze's cold glare told me that she wasn't lying at all.

It's going to be the hardest, most exhausting thing in the world.

Before we were even married, Olivia declared that she would scratch every chance she got.



* * *



The devil, half-dead in the morning, was a ghost in the afternoon, pounding on Airi's door.

"They say demons follow Archdemons, but of course they're not without feelings."

Airi nodded at Reinhardt's explanation, as if it were a given.

"So if your wives are all human, that's going to be a problem for the demons, too, so my presence is definitely going to make a difference."



Airi nodded slightly, as if she understood what he meant.

"That....... I wonder if it's too easy to decide......."

Reinhardt's reaction to Airi, who seemed to be approving of the marriage rather than agreeing to it, made him uneasy.

"You're right, Charlotte, you should marry more, but it's not balanced to have too many humans, so maybe you should consider finding some demons to be your brides?"

"Uh......?"

"How about Sarkegar? He's been a crucial player since the fall of the Darklands, so I can't blame him, and he can take any form you want."

"Er......? Sarkegar......?"

Reinhardt's complexion turned white at the mention of a name that had nothing to do with the one Charlotte had written down, but was so out of place.

I'm afraid you're going to respond too strongly.

"Or we could try to find the surviving Dreadfind clan, or organize the remaining demons in the Darklands, or the Mermaid Queen........ Are you physically challenged? I've heard that some mermaids are capable of living on land......."

"Hey, is that....... Excuse me......?"

"There's also an Archdemon who was married to an Orc."

"Just....... Just swear!"

"Come to think of it, there's also Elise."

"......what?"

"Valerie, aren't you technically the closest to Eleris out of all of us?"

In fact, only a few people know that Eleris is an ancient Archdemon, and Airi doesn't know it.

Reinhardt's complexion was as white as a vampire's.

"Mi, don't be crazy! That, that's....... That's a no-no!"

"Are you saying ...... can't because it's undead?"

"Oh, no!"

"......?"

In the end, Airi said something that made the demon want to vomit blood.



* * *



"I'll take my time finding a demon bride for you.



Reinhard slipped out of Airi's room like a fugitive, heading for the next location.

It's just a matter of time before it happens, and that's what I'm thinking.

But I never expected this.

Reinhardt can certainly say that.

Why do we need to do this?

Why you need to do this.

But eventually you have to do it.

-Smart

Reinhard knocks on someone's door.

A moment later, the door cautiously opened.

-Dalcock

"Is there a ...... meeting?"

Louise von Schwarz looked at the demon and shook her head.

"That....... that......."

If there was a suicide button, I'd press it right now.

"Ooh, we....... We need to talk....... Ha, that....... want to......?"

Reinhardt thought so.

"Yes, by all means."

Louise nodded.
