Riana and Klippmann's tense mood had broken a bit.

It was enough to know that we still cared about each other.

"Are you capable of....... that far?"

"Yes."

"I heard there was some kind of weather anomaly last winter....... Is that it?"

"That's right, it was me."

When Riana tells him that she can now do more than summon lightning, she can also cause extreme weather events, he can't help but panic.

I nodded dumbly, realizing that this was the most extreme weather event I'd ever seen, and that Riana had done it.

"That's amazing......."

"But this one, you can't just use it, it's a little different."

"What if it's unusual?"

"Um......."

Riana sighs heavily, sitting on the jaw of a rock.

"Should I say, the shittier the mood, the stronger the effect......."

"Um......?"

"My superpowers seem to react to my emotions. Things like extreme weather....... react to negative emotions."

The ability to react to dark, negative emotions.

I didn't wake up from a good experience in the first place.

Unless you can manipulate your emotions at will, triggers like this are bound to have limitations.

"It's a powerful ability, but....... I don't think I'll be able to use it easily."

Klippmann's words made Riana shake her head.

"Not really, I can use it whenever I want to use it."

"I thought you said you had to feel bad to use ......?"

"There's a way."

Riana pulled the potion from her bosom.

To Cliff, it was just a vial of some unknown substance. Riana smiles eerily.

"If I get this one wrong, I get so depressed that I want to hang myself right now."

"A drug that makes you depressed....... for depression?"

"Right."

"You eat that stuff?"

"But there are no side effects. It's safe, and if there are some side effects, so be it. If I can kill hundreds of thousands of monsters in exchange for a few mood swings, so be it."

It's not life-threatening, it just makes you feel a little, well, bad.

Cliffman could only nod, dumbfounded, as if such a thing shouldn't be done. Some people can't kill a single monster without risking their lives, and if that's the price they have to pay, then they should do it.

But as Kliffman said that, he saw Riana's hand trembling slightly as she held the crystal potion.

Clearly, Riana was afraid of the drug in her hands.

You know best what a terrible feeling it is to drink it.

Not without a price, but we're talking hundreds of thousands.

Kliffman seemed to be distracted by the unit.

If you add up all the monsters Cliff has ever killed, you'll never reach 10,000.

But Riana can do that with a single use of her ability. Cliffman is stronger than he used to be, but Riana is on a different level.

In a single battle, Riana can slay dozens of times the number of monsters that Cliff has killed so far.

Klippmann's expression hardened, and Riana took his hand.

"What's wrong....... Don't give me that look."

"No. You and I have different things we can do. I was just, like, thinking about it."

"Yes......."

Cliff knows that everyone can do different things.

The number of monsters Cliff has killed so far exceeds a thousand units, a feat that would be impossible without Riana's overpowered abilities.

You just have the wrong comparison.

Could there be more psychics than Riana?

The moment Riana was able to call lightning.

Kliffman couldn't help but think back to that time.

At her father's coffin, Riana screamed and awakened her powers.

Although he doesn't know much about psychics, Klippmann clearly remembers the moment when Riana awakened to these new powers after a traumatic experience.

And now, it has even more power.

Did you naturally have that power?

Or.......

"Riana."

"Huh?"

"Did you ever....... what happened....... happened?"

Father's death.

What is the equivalent of that, the awakening of another power through something else.

Clifford could tell by the way Riana's complexion immediately changed at his question that something had happened.

After a moment of silence.

"I have sinned."

"......."

"A sin so great, so irreparable."

It was hard for Kliffman to comprehend that he wasn't sad, that he had done something to deserve it.

Riana kept her explanation short.

It killed people, not monsters.

An unfathomable number of people.

I didn't explain anything beyond that.

"Why....... did you do that?"

Riana wouldn't have done that for no reason, so Kliffman couldn't help but ask.

"There was a reason, obviously."

"......."

Riana stares at the bare ground of the forest, at the weeds growing beneath her.

"But I realized, too late, that there are some things you shouldn't do even if you have a reason."

It was something I felt I had to do, but in the end, I shouldn't have.

You did something you shouldn't have done, and now someone else is paying the price.

"So, I don't think about revenge anymore."

I've become such a ridiculous person that even talking about revenge for something is ridiculous, so revenge is out of my head.

That's all Riana had to say.



* * *



Riana is back.

No matter how long we talked, it was a short reunion.

Cliffman went back, and Riana was waiting for us at the location we had told her.

"So, how was the story?"

"Weren't you hiding and listening anyway?"

Riana's words left Harriet and I speechless.

"......How did you know?"

"I bet you don't."

b.

Was he surprisingly obvious?

No, I think it's a bit ridiculous to think it's not obvious.

Riana's expression grew lighter. Kliffman would be, too.

If so, Cliffman may support us later, but he's not the only reason Riana met Cliffman, because she finds meaning there.

Regardless of the political implications, there are things that need to be addressed before the final fight.

"Are you happy?"

"A little?"

Riana smirked and nodded at my question.

There's still a lot going on.

"Let's go back, it won't do us any good to stay around here longer."

After saying that, Herriot starts casting.

Clearly, Riana was scared.

I wonder if Cliff is different.

Clearly, Cliffman has changed, but not in the way Riana fears.

Obviously, I checked in to see how everyone was doing, albeit in a different guise.

But that didn't tell me how they would react when they actually saw me.

Just as Cliff doesn't resent Riana, there may be people who don't actually resent me. This was the case with Scarlett.

They may not show it on the outside, but like Christina, they may be harboring hatred on the inside.

Cliff wasn't the only person Riana had to meet.

But faced with Cliffman, Riana looks a lot more relaxed.

I wanted to meet someone, even if it was just me.

It's not long now.

That's the kind of person you want to meet.

Besides Ellen, there was only one other person.



* * *



A day before the march.

Adriana entered the barracks for the first time in her life.

I wasn't scared, but I couldn't help but feel nervous about the unknown.

The master of the barracks was sitting at his desk, not in a chair, his arms crossed, watching Adriana intently.

It was a frown.

We don't know his actual age, but he looks about five years older than he is.

He smiles all the time and seems to make a good impression wherever he goes. But this was Adriana's first time alone with him, and she couldn't help but feel uncomfortable with his smiling face.

You're smiling, but it's a smile that looks like it's stuck in your face.

The other person is smiling, but Adriana unnecessarily gets the feeling that they're not smiling at all.

Adriana, Paladin.

And the Supreme Commander of the Paladins.

Rowen, the leader of the Crusader Knights, stood before Adriana.

Really suddenly.

Adriana was summoned by the leader of the Crusader Knights.

Although a paladin, Adriana moves with the Temple army, and while she is technically a member of the Crusaders, she is not under their control.

As such, Adriana was both surprised and nervous when the new leader of the Crusader Knights, whom she rarely saw, summoned her.

The story of the sudden replacement of the previous Crusader leader, Elayon Bolton, was a strange one for Adriana, who was no longer moving with the Crusaders.

We still don't really know how it happened.

Even Adriana couldn't make sense of the situation, and it was clear that things were even more chaotic within the Crusader Order. And the chaos was still ongoing.

A figure of controversy and suspicion, Rowen's history is said to be quite strange.

He is rumored to have ties to the dark side of the Cult of the Lord.

Inquisitors, or death squads.

Someone who shouldn't be out there is out there.

Is this okay?

Adriana could feel the unowned horses running amok in her suspicions.

Then, Rowen, the suspicious new leader of the Crusaders, summoned Adriana.

You've never seen yourself, and you don't care.

Adriana is not a high-ranking paladin.

While their skills are nothing to sneeze at, and they are often already at or above the level of a High Paladin, they have no real title and no real duties.

That's why the call from the leader of the Crusader Knights seemed so bizarre to Adriana.

Even.

He had it open and in front of him, and he was sitting at his desk, not in a chair, but at his desk, staring at himself.

He's smiling, but somehow reluctant.

Rudely, I can't help but think that the stare is offensive.

"Sir, if I've done anything wrong......."

Eventually, Adriana couldn't resist and cautiously spoke up.

At Adriana's words, Rowen shook his head.

"......No?"

"Then is there something, anything I should do....... to do?"

"Hmmm......."

Adriana asks, but Rowen remains silent.

This is an unknown person.

We can usually get some idea of how a person is feeling from their facial expressions and reactions.

But Rowen, the leader of the Crusader Knights in front of him, felt none of that.

He's smiling, but it doesn't make him look happy, and you can't tell what he's thinking.

As if they had some kind of special "training".

When you're talking to someone whose intentions and feelings you can't guess, it's easy to feel uncomfortable.

But it's someone with more power and authority than you.

If you're a human being with the power of life and death, you're supposed to be horrified, not offended.

Adriana couldn't help but sense that Rowen was used to such things.

Someone who is used to instilling fear in others with their demeanor alone.

Naturally, Adriana had a hunch that one of the rumors was likely true.

The crusader leader uses honorifics to Adriana, a sarcastic subordinate, but it's hard to tell if he's being respectful or not.

How much time has passed.

Just when Adriana thinks she's frozen in place.

"You've had quite the career, Adriana."

"......?"

Adriana's panic grew as she realized that the sound was coming from nowhere.

A storied career.

Was there anything you could say about yourself?

"Isn't being from the Temple Royal class a distinguished career in itself?"

"ah......."

Adriana nods thoughtfully, wondering if that's what he was talking about.

On every continent, talent is a temple to be scraped.

Only the most talented among them are admitted to the Royal Class. Status and power don't matter. Only talent determines admission to the Royal Class.

So, that alone is enough to make his career a royal one.

"I don't know about you, but I don't know about....... I'm not sure."

Adriana doesn't say that because she's modest.

Indeed, powerful psychics and wizards certainly have firepower befitting their origins and talents.

Adria told herself that she paled in comparison to such formidable talent.

"Why, does it have to be mages and psychics? I thought you had a lot of experience slaying monsters, even compared to the high ranking paladins and priests in the Crusade."

"...... did."

You can't remember how many times you've been out slaying monsters. He's been out monstering for as long as the Gate has been going on, and not just with the Alliance.

Before I knew it, the crusader had a career worthy of attention.

Rowen begins to read the papers on the desk next to him.

"From the Abbey of Artouan, in the Duchy of Saint-Théon....... Birth is unclear and....... Educated at the monastery, showed talent and entered the Temple Royal class......."

Was it a document that contained his history?

Adriana watches as Rowen reads it in silence.

"Dropped out of Temple around sophomore year....... Returned to the military after the Gates scandal broke. Since then, I've transferred to Temple and have been a member of the Army ever since......."

Unsurprisingly, his history included not only dropping out, but also returning to the Temple and joining their forces following the outbreak of the Gate.

The rest of the book was all about the battle, and Rowen didn't read any further.

So at the end of the day, why did you prepare your history and what do you have to say?

Rowen gets off the desk and walks over to Adriana.

"We're from the same place."

"......?"

"I'm from a monastery, too, sweetheart."

Adriana was taken aback by this out-of-the-blue statement.

A child abandoned in a monastery.

So does Rowen, so does Adriana.

They seem to be about the same age. Rowen would be the older one.

"Talent, I think, or something like that."

Rowen's words were becoming increasingly unintelligible to Adriana.

We're from the same monastery, we're the same age. They even have similar talents.

But I'm a Crusader Knight Commander, and you're a mere paladin in the Temple Army.

Are you trying to criticize the difference?

Adriana couldn't figure out why the chief had to make such a pointless remark to her.

Rowen holds still and brings her hand to Adriana's cheek.

Adriana was suddenly aware of Rowen's hand on her cheek, the feel of it eerie.

It's not because I feel bad.

It's actually kind of eerie.

In contrast to his good-natured, clean-looking face, Rowen's calloused palms were overly rough and hard.

The same could be said for Adriana's hands, but the texture of her parched hands clearly represented something of the texture of Rowen's life.

The crusader leader looks at one of the paladins and speaks.

"You and I, what difference does it make......."

It's not derogatory or sarcastic.

"I'm like this, and you're like this......."

There was an undeniable tinge of jealousy and envy in his tone.

Adriana couldn't understand what she was feeling for Rowen. Why in the world would the crusader leader call her, and why would he say things she couldn't understand?

"There's someone who wants to meet you."

That's all the crusader leader had to say.



* * *



The crusader leader ended up shouting something unintelligible.

It just said that someone wanted to meet her and gave her a location and a designated time.

The time is night.

It was an unknown command, but we couldn't deny it.

So Adriana headed to the southern part of the garrison, unaccompanied by anyone else.

Why in the world would a crusader leader issue such an order?

Someone wants to see me.

If I wanted to meet with someone about Adriana's age, who isn't even a very high ranking paladin, would I be able to ask the crusader leader for such a favor?

So who is the other side?

Why on earth would they want to see you?

In doubt, Adriana left the garrison and continued walking south.

A meadow, far away from the battlefield, with no sign of the battle.

In the moonlight, Adriana could soon see someone sitting in the grass.

"ah......."

I still don't know what's going on.

I don't even know how this happened.

But Adriana can only guess at some level.

What was happening.

Why the crusader leader gave such an order.

So what happened to the Crusaders?

We don't know everything, but we have a good idea of what's going on and what's happened.

And why on earth would anyone want to see me, a nobody.

The man who had been sitting still jumped to his feet at the sight of Adriana.

I wouldn't call it a painted face by any stretch of the imagination.

I can't even say I've missed him.

It wasn't like that.

We weren't even that close.

But obviously.

Still.

Deep down.

You have someone in front of you who you know is very important to you.

"Line......hart......?"

"It's been a while."

In the moonlight, the unimpressive junior smiles sadly, as he always does.

"Senior."

And I called her by the same name I called her then.

Like a spell, Adriana could not know everything, but she could know a single truth.

"You're safe......!"

Adriana ran like she was possessed, hugging her bad-tempered junior fiercely.

"Well, who am I?"

Just like before.

The ugly junior was being arrogant.
