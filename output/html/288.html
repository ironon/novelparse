            Episode 288.





Monday.

It's the start of the long-awaited Temple Festival, and I have a week of work ahead of me.

For one week starting today, the Temple will be open to all civilians.

Of course, it's mostly parents who come to the temple to see their children. With students coming from all over the continent, some parents come to visit their children for the festival, while others are just zodiac people who come to enjoy the temple festivities.

Of course, in this case, the safety of Temple students is our top priority, so restricted areas are in place, and security is much higher than usual.

But even if you're well-protected, you're still going to get a lot of people.

The opening of the temple to civilians means that it is during these festivals that the temple is most vulnerable.

While this year is uneventful, next year's holiday festivities, just before the gates open, will capitalize on the vulnerable moment and cause a ruckus.

But I'm not even sure if that's going to happen.

If history is any indication, the accident could happen this year.

If the Black Order were to come to the Temple, this would be the easiest time to do it. They haven't said whether they're coordinating internally or not.

If they come, I'll have to deal with them, and I'm pretty sure they won't try to kill me, at least.

Anyway, Monday.

It's a festive time of year, but we're not on vacation yet.

Clifford, Ellen, and Riana all returned to their dorms.

All the students of Royal Class were now assembled in the main hall under the direction of the Student Council.

In front of the entire Royal Class gathered on the first floor, Student Council President Ceres van Owen stood at the top of the stairs.

"Starting today, the Gradias Temple festival will run for a week."

She used honorifics because she was in front of the whole school.

"Normally, the Orbis Class and the Royal Class would participate in the opening ceremony at the Great Stadium, but as you know, this year all of the official events and schedules that are supposed to take place during the festivities have been canceled, including the opening ceremony."

"So, very unusually, the Royal Class has been granted unlimited free time during the festival. Students who wish to participate in tournaments or festivals on a personal basis are free to do so."

"This year, you just have to enjoy the festivities. If you want to do something, do it, if you want to play, play. You've worked hard all year, and you can participate in activities to recognize your accomplishments, or you can just kick back and relax."

"We don't have any official event precautions, but we'll spread general precautions."

"We have a significant number of civilians in the temple right now. They come from all walks of life and all walks of status. We ask you not to get into unnecessary confrontations with civilians, and we ask you not to get into confrontations with them."

"There are always a number of frictions between students and civilians at Temple festivals, some of which are the students' mistakes, some of which are the civilians' mistakes. If an unidentified civilian puts undue pressure on you, you can ask a nearby guard for help and it will be dealt with immediately. There is a lot of security at the moment, so you'll see Temple guards everywhere. Of course, if you put pressure or show of force, it will be dealt with as well."

In short, don't get in trouble and don't get hurt. Ceres van Owen looked down at her students after she finished.

"As President of the Royal Class, I would like to wish you a successful year with these festivities."

It's a celebration of all the hard work that every Temple student has put in during the year. So play, have fun, and then relax as you head into winter break.

Of course.

For me, it felt less like a break after a hard run and more like a final gateway to get through the year.

Tournaments validate how much I've improved from not being able to do anything at the beginning of the semester.

If I win the Grade 1 tournament, I'll see how far I can go in the main event of the Unlimited tournament.

Miss and Mr. Temple.

And a freaking cross-dressing contest.

Let's get over this hump and take a breather.

"Have a great festival. Over."

With that, the festivities began, with some students rushing out of the dormitory as if they had been waiting for this moment, and others returning to their dormitories with sullen expressions on their faces, as if they didn't care about the festivities.

Herriot was moving with a group of people.

They were members of the Society for the Study of Magic.

-You guys play, I'm fine.

-No, it's okay, let's go.

-This is really good.......

-I've still got a lot of work to do, and the main event is just around the corner.

The members of the first-year Magical Research Society gathered around, led by Herriot.

-Junior, are you practicing today or not?

And then there's Redina.

-Ah, yeah....... I was thinking about it, but you can go to the festival.......

-No, this is more fun!

-Well, that's.......

Apparently, the Magical Research Society is backing Herriot in the Unlimited tournament.

He never told me how he did it, but he won his group in an unlimited tournament and advanced to the main event.

I wouldn't have done it myself, but he did.

Herriot's level of skill in combat means that it's very likely that his combat skills are on par with mine, and possibly better, even with very few hits.

I've been hit, bruised, rolled over, and groped.

Herriot felt the desire to be a good fighter, and he was succeeding.

So rather than enjoying the festivities, Heriot seems to be focusing on preparing for an unlimited tournament. Apparently, the members of the Magical Research Society are helping out.

The same majors are coming together to create synergies that are separate from the work I've already ordered.

This is a good thing.

Herriot made eye contact with me before heading toward the Ministry of Magic.

I'm sure he'll come over to watch, but he'll be busy doing his own thing.

After a brief, apologetic glance, Harriet left the dorm.

I mean, it's not like it's a big deal, so why feel bad about it?

Herriot left the dorm.

I was at the back of the line for the Class A dorm, and at the front was Ellen.

You've spent the weekend trying things on and trying to figure out what to do at Miss Temple.

He turns his head and looks at me.

I left Temple on Friday and returned late last night, so it's been a few days since we've seen each other.

Makeup is something I'd have done in The Duchess of Granz, but of course, Ellen is bare-chested now and her outfit is just a school uniform.

"?"

Ellen shakes her head as I glare at her.

By the way.

What should I say?

I don't think it's much different from the usual, but I don't know if it looks any prettier.

-Ellen! Come to my room. My new makeup order just came in this morning.

-Ah, yeah.

Ellen stared at me, then was grabbed by Riana's arm and dragged away.

-Do I have to call you?

-Ah. Uh, yeah.......

-Isn't it time for you to take charge? What's wrong with the kid?

-Me, sorry.......

Ellen on the right, Cliffman on the left.

Riana dragged herself away.

Ellen was glaring at me as she was being dragged away.

Are you debating whether or not to come to the tournament today?

What to say.

Rather than enjoying it, everyone seems busier than usual.......

It's a festival, and I want it to be festive.

It felt like that.

"Reinhardt!"

-Wrong!

"What the hell!"

Suddenly, Olivia wrapped her arms around my back and I jumped in surprise.

"Let's go play with my sister, there's so much we want to eat and do!"

Olivia looks at me with a twinkle in her eye.

"I'm busy with the first grade tournament finals today."

"Oh, right, so can I show you around today?"

"If it comes, it comes, and if it doesn't, it doesn't."

As Olivia was talking, her eyes met Ellen's as she was being pulled away by Riana in the distance.

"Hey, you said Miss Temple was coming out."

"Yes....... That's right."

Olivia unwinds her arms from around me and looks back and forth between me and Ellen.

"Are you going to take a picture of me?"

I had no answer, and Olivia pinched my cheek.

"An empty-headed idiot."

Olivia smirked, then went off somewhere.

Monday.

There are tons of events, performances, and activities going on throughout the temple, but I was far from the hustle and bustle of the festivities.

Today is the day of the first grade tournament finals. The tournament finals for each grade level will continue in the same stadium, and the seats will be filled with spectators.

I'm in Group A. It's my first match.

There are a total of 32 first-year finalists.

Round of 32, Round of 16, and Round of 8.

There are three matches left to play, with the semifinals and final tomorrow.

To prepare for the first grade tournament, I teamed up with Ludwig and Scarlett.

Needless to say, Scarlett and Ludwig also qualified.

Ludwig looked at the bracket and smiled pleasantly.

"I just happened to be in the wrong group, thank goodness."

I was in Group A, Scarlett was in Group B, and Ludwig was in Group C. We won't see each other until the winner of our group is crowned.

If we're playing each other in a tournament, it's at least a semifinal.

"Is that a coincidence?"

"Did you do this on purpose, then?"

Ludwig.......

My sins are great for making you this way.

"Sure, why not, if you put the favorites in a group, there's nothing to see later."

"Oh, I see......."

There are four main brackets.

Groups A, B, and C have people from the royal class.

And there are some familiar names in the Group D bracket.

Gladen Amorell.

The Orbis class is gone, but it's joined by a guy who moved to the regular class.

There may have been other girls from the Orbis class, but I didn't recognize their names. Nilsonia or Rilka Aaron or Ender Wilton or something.

There may have been some unknowns in the mix, but we've got Gladen Amorelle in Group D for now.

If we win our group, who will we play against Gladen Amorelle?

We don't know yet.

We were on our way to the stadium where the main event of the tournament was being held. There, we'll play three matches today, followed by the semifinals and finals tomorrow.

Ludwig was laughing heartily.

"The kids are coming over later, what if I get nervous?"

There are only two finalists in the B class. So they're coming to watch the tournament as a group, except for a few... to watch Ludwig and Scarlett compete, to be exact.

Apparently, they're all coming except for the Magic Society.

How about mine.

Ellen and Harriet probably won't be able to make it.......

Olivia's the only one who's coming, but she seemed a little upset earlier, and I don't think she's coming.

What about Charlotte? There's a bunch of B kids, so maybe they're not coming to see me.

No, I'm just going to do my job, whether you come or not.

Why am I feeling a little nervous?

Why do I feel like I'm the only one whose parents aren't coming to the sporting event where everyone else's parents are?

I've been a kid for so long that I really don't think I'm any different than a kid, but now?

"Reinhard! Let's go!"

"Uh."

An unnecessarily stiff answer came out.
