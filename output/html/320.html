"Where the hell is this guy and what is he doing?"

Liana de Granz, arms folded, frowned and muttered.

The Miss & Mr. Temple contest has already started.

The students in Royal Class were all sitting in adjacent seats watching the contest.

"So......."

Herriot muttered to himself at Riana's nervous tone.

The contestants may have all been like that, but they were all good-looking, and if that wasn't enough, they all had great personalities.

Ellen's entry number is 9.

We've just finished turn 7, so it's time for Ellen's turn.

All my classmates are here, including Kono Lint, except Reinhardt.

Where and what are they doing.

Herriot had mixed feelings.

I don't know what happened to Reinhardt, but I thought he was going to come, but he didn't.

According to Riana, the fifth grader also kept not showing up in the waiting room for some reason.

What is it doing.

If he's supposed to be there, why isn't he?

I'm simultaneously thankful that Reinhardt isn't around, and I'm not.

Harriet knows it's cowardly of her to hope Reinhard doesn't come, but she's also afraid to see what Ellen looks like today.

Everyone was puzzled that Reinhardt was nowhere to be seen.

Herriot watched, anxious and nervous, not sure why he was nervous.

Contestant 7, who was a little nervous, but calmly completed the dance for the appeal time, and it was time for the next contestant, Contestant 8.

As the man's turn came and went, Herriot found himself growing impatient.

The 9th participant.

-And now we have a Royal Class contestant, and as you all know, Royal Classes are numbered in order of merit. This contestant is a Royal Class first-year A student, number two. Ms. Ellen!

To the sound of applause, Ellen walked out onto the stage.

"......."

Of course I knew that.

She's always in her school uniform or sweatpants. Harriet knows that Ellen has a very striking appearance.

However, the sight of Ellen in her full glory made Harriet's mouth drop open in disbelief.

It seems that Riana has been trying to figure out what color would look best on Ellen so far.

Ellen was now wearing a snowy white dress. Her hair was tied up and accented with a ribbon. Similarly, Ellen was wearing white heels, which Harriet thought made her stand out a bit too much from the other contestants.

Riana watched Ellen with satisfaction, while her classmates and the audience, who didn't know her, stared at her blankly.

I practiced smiling a lot, and by now I had perfected a pretty convincing smile.

That's it.

I'd say it's right up there with Olivia.

Herriot thought about it.

But no matter what the onlookers thought, Ellen just smiled and stared at the audience.

As if looking for something.

Looking for something, Ellen soon found herself locking eyes with someone she wasn't looking for: Harriet.

His eyes lock with hers, to be precise, and he scans the area. As if looking for someone who isn't there.

Eventually, the gaze returns to Herriot.

He gave me a questioning look.

He looked at me as if to ask if I hadn't found it.

Herriot's heart seemed to tighten, even though he wasn't in the room.

Ellen asks Harriet with a glare.

Where's Reinhardt?

Herriot didn't know what to say to that gaze. She couldn't laugh, and she couldn't cry.

For some reason, he seemed to have a very strange look on his face.

Ellen lets the snow fall.

As if Herriot's conundrum was an answer in itself.

-Ms. Ellen, was there a particular reason you wanted to participate in Miss Temple?

-A.......

Ellen purses her lips.

You wanted to say something.

Harriet sees that Ellen is shaking her head, still and trembling.

-Who in particular would you like to show this to today? Was there anyone like this?

-.......

When asked by the moderator, Ellen had no answer.

It was, in this situation, exactly what Ellen needed to hear.

She gritted her teeth as she watched Ellen agonize over what to say.

A moment ago, Herriot was glad Reinhardt hadn't shown up.

But when I saw Ellen in such a pathetic state, I had only one thought.

I feel like Ellen is going to break.

If nothing else, that was the last thing he wanted.

'Where are you.......'

Herriot clenched his fists involuntarily.

'Where are you and what are you doing.......'

Herriot resented Reinhardt for not coming.



* * *



Sarkegar watched the situation from the outskirts of the abandoned monastery. The monastery was huge, but it had been abandoned for so long that it had an air of dilapidation about it.

Sarkegaard didn't quite understand the situation yet.

I'm just rushing in because I've been told there's something I need to do, and I don't really know what's going on here yet.

But there are people to rescue and enemies to defeat.

I don't know why they do it, but it's their way of making their presence known.

The goal is, as always, infiltration.

This time, it's a rescue, not a kidnapping.

Transformed into a sparrow, Sarkegar flew effortlessly over the outer walls of the monastery and made his way inside.

It wasn't heavily guarded, but there were a few troops stationed here and there.

The best of them, the ones that are a real threat, are in their twenties.

The lord told me to rescue two women.

A woman is locked up in a monastery.

Even the woman who just rushed into the monastery.

The number of armed men in the monastery who could use divine power would be greater than that.

Sarkegar is a member of the demon race.

As such, they are as incompatible with holy power as the undead Eleris, if not more so. As such, I wasn't too keen on the idea of infiltrating a place infested with high-ranking paladins.

However, there's no hoopla about doing the command.

Sarkegar enters the monastery and flies cautiously, keeping his eyes peeled for signs of activity.

-Where is Adriana?

Without having to look too closely, Sarkeghar could hear the angry voices coming from the clearing.

She has just arrived at the monastery.

-That's after you've answered the question.

-You know what the answer is going to be.

-Then you have a good idea of what's going to happen.

-What do you want?

Sarkegaard moved closer to the scene where he could hear the conversation.

A vacant lot in a monastery.

A middle-aged man sat in a worn chair around a campfire, accompanied by several paladins, and across from him was a young blonde woman in temple robes.

Sarkegaard knows that the middle-aged man is Leverier Ranze.

"Return to Tuan and recant all testimony you have given, and profess that you regret it."

"......."

"The Five Great Houses will break with the Empire and establish an independent Holy Empire, led by the Crusader Knights, and you will be its first Grand Prelate."

"What....... nonsense......."

Olivia stares at Leviathan.

Thriving.

Independent.

Just hearing those words made Olivia's breath catch in her throat.

"......If you can't do that?"

"You're going to start doing things you're going to regret."

"You mean you're going to kill Adriana? That little girl, not even a nun yet?"

"Let's call it an unavoidable sacrifice. God will understand."

The look on Olivia's face as she watched Leviathan raise the shield of the name of God in front of his evil deeds was one of clear contempt and disgust.

"...... Is this your father's way? To be so angry, so resentful of his loss of power. Is this your way, to abandon your faith and your humanity?"

"This is the only choice we have to counter the threat to the Five Great Houses, and you know full well that no one will be harmed if you promise to return."

"I'm not going back."

"What if something happened to the kid who saved you?"

"......."

Despair and anger flashes across Olivia's face.

While he believes in Olivia's vision of success, Leverrier Ranch√© is actually looking to rehabilitate his own reputation and redeem himself from the consequences of contradicting Olivia's words.

"Why me? Why me? Why me? If he wants to do something, he should just do it. I don't understand why he has to put me in front of him, like this....... I don't know why you're threatening me with someone else's life like this. I really don't......."

"Because, as I always say, there's no one better qualified than you."

"Don't try to rationalize it with words like that, please......."

Olivia finally breaks down in tears, overcome with grief.

"It's just, you want power, you want to put me out there and fulfill your own greed, so you've created this weird group. You want to reverse what I said to clear your name and get back in power......."

"Olivia, I don't expect you to understand what I mean. But there is a role, a destiny, and I live for it."

Levereer Ranze was like a toothpick wouldn't fit in his mouth.

"My role was previously to lead the Demon Kingdoms to victory in the Great War, and now it's to protect the Crusader Knights, the general body of the Five Great Houses, from the clutches of the Empire."

In front of Olivia, who is furious, Leverrier Ranze doesn't reveal any personal feelings.

"And you are my next. I have made you that way, I have raised you that way, and if it doesn't happen, I will make it happen."

"What the heck....... Why the hell......."

"If you refuse, do you think it will be a matter of Adriana alone?"

"!"

Olivia's eyes widened.

"You think Reinhardt is untouchable?"

"What the heck....... What the hell....... sound......?"

At the mention of Reinhardt's name, Sarkegaard, who has been watching the situation, stays still and watches Leviathan.

Sarkozy understood, if not completely, that the Leviathan should be removed.

He is a threat to Valerie. Sarkegaard watched Olivia's face twist at the mention of Reinhardt's name.

She is a clear ally of Reinhardt's. Sarkeghar is also convinced.

"If Adriana doesn't work, I'll just find someone else who means the world to you. Olivia, I brought you here to show you that this can't be the end."

"......."

"Give up, Olivia, before your little pain becomes a bigger pain and you hang on crying."

Olivia's eyes went dead at the words, as if her pulse had been knocked out of her.

Adriana is just the beginning.

If she doesn't give up, Levereer Ranze will destroy everything Olivia holds dear, one by one, by any means necessary.

Since threats and torture against Olivia herself will get him nowhere, he looks outside of himself for a way to shut her down.

You know you can't stand to see yourself hurt, but you can't stand to see those you care about hurt.

No stranger to sacrifice, Olivia knows she'd rather sacrifice herself than see her loved ones hurt.

Like when Radia Schmidt tried to self-destruct with a berserk, she made the sacrifice of forfeiting her win.

Rivera knew how to move Olivia.

"You are....... You're the devil......."

Olivia said in a desperate tone. The paladins around her flinch at the words, but Levereer Ranze holds up a hand to stop them from speaking.

"Yeah. If you can't get away from....... this must be it."

Olivia's body begins to burn with an explosion of holy light and blue mana.

Using both holy power and mana to strengthen her body, Olivia glares at Leviathan.

"If I die or you die, it's all over."

Rather than live under this hopeless compulsion, Olivia ultimately chose to resist rather than comply or succumb to it.

Because if you die, no one else will be sacrificed.

But first, if he could, he would kill the man who had done such a terrible thing. But Levereer Ranze remained calm in the face of Olivia, who was clearly enraged.

"Do you think I didn't know you would make that choice?"

Leviathan beckoned. Two paladins emerged from somewhere in the hallway.

"......!"

"The moment you try to fool around, you're going to see Adriana die."

"Senior......."

Adriana, looking miserable, was being dragged by the paladins to the clearing. Olivia stared wide-eyed at Leviathan.

"Holy....... Damn......!"

"Even if you try your hand here, you're going to end up dead, and you're going to have to see Adriana die first."

From the guilty look on Adriana's face, it was clear that she was well aware of what she was doing and what she was being used as bait for.

Olivia couldn't reach out after all. The moment Olivia tried anything, the sword at Adriana's throat would do its job.

"First of all, I don't know why you think this is a bad thing, all of this is the first step in doing things to protect the congregation. It's saving a lot of lives. You could save a lot of lives if you would just change your mind a little bit."

Olivia had no answer for Leverier Ranze's words.

No, it didn't.

The author believes so strongly in what he is saying that nothing he says makes sense. He doesn't doubt himself because he believes his path is truly just.

Olivia knows both of them well.

He's that kind of guy.

Always demanding, never persuaded.

"Mr. Senior....... I, never mind me!"

"Adriana......."

Held captive, Adriana turned to Olivia, a guilty look on her face.

The look on Adriana's face was one of disillusionment beyond disappointment. She was disappointed that this was all she could hope for, and she had lost the will to live.

"Sir...... I'm, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. As you wish......."

"Adriana, don't say anything. I....... I......."

I.

Olivia couldn't finish her next sentence.

What can I do to save Adriana?

To save Adriana, you must stand in front of them.

You have to go after something you don't even want, whether it's a Holy Roman Empire or something.

Leviathan Lance may be able to become a crusader again, but he must lie and say that the harsh things he did to him were all lies.

Adriana is just the beginning.

Olivia thinks coldly.

For now, let's listen to them.

After listening, you realize that Adriana is safe and sound.

Let's die.

If you're dead, you're not going to bully anyone to change their mind, and you won't be able to bully yourself anymore.

His own death would be the greatest revenge on Leviathan, and the last thing he wants for those who would use him is to die.

Olivia thinks so, and decides to accept the offer for now.

Then.

-skuck!

"Boom!"

-Chak!

"Boom!"

Suddenly. Something happened.

The two paladins holding Adriana were suddenly decapitated.

The sudden fountain of blood caused Olivia's mouth to drop open, as well as Leviathan's.

In the darkness, a figure embraced Adriana's captive body, watching the two decapitated bodies struggle.

"What is a human being."

A dark shape, like a shadowy figure, murmurs in the darkness, its red gaping maw open.

"How wicked you are."

A dark figure, seemingly more evil than anything else in the world, smiles as it speaks of the wickedness of man.

-shhhh!

"!"

Shadows enveloped Olivia's entire body, the black form too terrifying to reach.

"Oh, no......!"

"Demon......?"

He stretches out his wings of shadowy membranes that look like a tangle of shadows, and soars into the sky.

-Whoosh!

"Hahahahahahahaha!"

The creature that had snatched Adriana disappeared into the sky in a flash, along with a bull that tore through the night sky. It happened so fast that Olivia was unable to resist, and she was caught in the creature's trap and left dangling in the night sky.

-What, what! Let go of me!

It was a soft, cutesy scream that didn't fit the serious, ominous mood.

"What is that!"

"I think it's a demon!"

"Uh, how can a demon be in the ecliptic......!"

No one knew what it was, though Revere Lance suddenly shouted at the mysterious demonic creature that had taken Olivia and Adriana away.

But it didn't take long for me to panic about the situation.

This is where things got even more confusing.

-Currrrrr!

Dark clouds hung in the night sky, and the darkness of the night was filled with light.

-Flash!

Suddenly, lightning starts raining down from the sky.

Herriot de Saint-Ouen summoned Thunderbolt in battle against Olivia Ranze.

They rain down, dozens and dozens of them.

-Currrrrr!

"Boom!"

"It's magic!"

The paladins who were struck by the light began to activate their holy powers to protect me, but those who didn't react quickly enough were charred and crumbled to dust.

The top-level destructive spell, Thunderstorm, has been cast.

"Demon attack!"

The paladins immediately recognized the situation and called out, but it was not good.

Thunderstorm wasn't the end of the story.

-chiyiying

There were several strange crackling noises as if the space around the monastery was being ripped apart, followed by massive shockwaves coming from the east, west, north, and south sides of the monastery.

-Quack, quack, quack!

Four chained explosions.

Explosion is cast four times in quick succession, and the already desolate monastery collapses and crumbles.

Paladins, priests, and covenanters who didn't use their shields strongly enough were already shattered.

It's a massacre.

The paladins are about to experience hell when a mysterious high level mage swoops in.

Lightning rained down, and the monastery was blown away by the explosion.

And.

-currrr

The earth trembles and flames begin to rise from the ground.

In the sky, a rain of lightning.

A storm of flames erupts from the earth.

The firestorm began to burn fiercely, threatening to sweep across the land.

"This is......."

Leviathan Lance watches as thunderbolts pummel his body and flames from the ground consume the paladins.

In front of the Crusader headquarters, a firestorm like this suddenly erupted.

A dragon appeared, and a mysterious lycanthrope wreaked havoc.

Revere Lance was not in charge of the succubus at the time, but he had heard the reports.

Isn't this, like, that feeling?

Unidentified Demon Attack.

As the wave of flames sweeps away, someone emerges through the flames and lightning.

As if the magic was deflecting itself, they were completely unaffected by this mess.

There was a lycanthrope, a wolf-like demon with a silver mane.

And next to it.

With fiery red hair and a pair of curved horns sprouting from its temples, it was something human, but not human.

-Crunch!

Lycanthrope and a mysterious demon appear in the center of the Inferno.

The demon was inside the wall of flames, a sword with a milky white hilt slung over its shoulder.

"Reverie Rancher."

The situation was one of incomprehensible consternation.

Leviathan cries out, even as he is hit by heat and thunderbolts.

"You are....... who are you!"

"Me?"

The demon boy comes toward you, dragging his sword across the ground.

"My name is Valerie."

"A foe of the demons."

"The rightful heir to the Darklands."

The boy aims his milky-white sword at Revere Lance.

Levereer Ranze's eyes widened as he couldn't help but recognize the sword for what it was.

"Uhhhhhhhhh!"

"Now....... you corrupt priest."

One through ten.

This situation didn't make any sense to him.

"Time to be punished."

But even if you don't understand it, it's happening.

A demon with a holy sword is trying to kill you.
