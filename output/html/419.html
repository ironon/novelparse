I debated whether or not to tell Ellen that I'd decided to head to Richie's grave because she'd come to visit, but I didn't.

I didn't want to drag Ellen into the mix when Harriet was already nervous, and she'd definitely try to follow me if I told her.

I don't know if Bertus will try to get Ellen involved, but for now, I don't want her there.

So I'm trying to figure out what to do, and then Ellen does something out of the blue.

I thought he had something to say, but I didn't expect him to kiss me.

I wondered if she had a change of heart or something, but she didn't really explain, just said she was sorry and left.

The unfamiliar feel of my lips, the look in Ellen's eyes, replayed in my head.

It's not the time to think about that.

I wondered what Ellen was thinking, and why she'd walked out without telling me, but I wasn't in a position to think about that right now.

I went straight to calling Lucinyl.

"Are you sure?"

I explained the situation to Rusinil as quickly as I could, and he replied with a serious look.

"Lothar Dwyn may not be a cantus magna, but once he is, the elite of the Empire will be heading to the tomb of the Reach."

Even if it's not Cantus Magna, it's certain that the best of the Empire will be entering Reach's tomb now. Quantum Maze might break through, and after that, the fight could get too big to handle.

"I've decided to join the Imperial forces and head to Ritchie's Tomb, because in the worst case scenario, we may have to withdraw, and in some cases, we may have to fight, and we need to get at least one mage from Cantus Magna. I need to get the word out to the Order and the Council as soon as possible, and I need you to get the word out to Sarkegar and Loyaar."

"Okay."

With those words, Lucinil dissolved into mist.

You're trying to catch Cantus Magna, but the Empire's finest are coming with you. Should you withdraw when this may be your only chance to capture Cantus Magna?

If the Empire takes all of your cantus magna, or you all die before you get the information, things get ugly.

And it's entirely possible that if you get it wrong, you'll give them a reason to complete Akasha.

Today at the earliest, tomorrow at the latest, I'm heading to the tomb of the Reach with the forces of the Empire.

There's nothing you need to bring with you.

I felt like praying.

I don't believe in gods.

And I can't pray to anyone, because if there is a God, I am the real God of this world.

I am the only body in the world that cannot pray to anyone.

I am God.

And my power is the word.

"Everything will be fine."

Therefore, I pray to me.

"Let's make it all work."

After all, I have to be good at it.

Saturday night.

An emergency meeting had been called in a land ruled by eternal winter.

Normally, only members of the Vampire Council would be seated at the round table in the Great Hall, but the nature of the Council had changed slightly, and due to the specifics of the current situation, non-vampires were gathered here.

The patriarchs of the four families of Lord Vampires, with the exception of Antrianus, who is in charge of Reach's tomb among the original members.

Elise, Lucinil, Lerouen, and Galarshga.

And Sarkegar, a minion of Valie's.

Eppinhauser, a member of the Black Order, was also present.

In fact, most of them were there, with the exception of Rynkanslope Loyaar.

"Are you certain that he is a member of the Cantus Magna?"

Lucinil narrowed her eyes at Eleris's question.

"I can't say for sure, it's all circumstantial, but to be able to do something like that in the palace and get away with it, and to have his eye on so many grimoires, it's just plain weird if he's not Cantus Magna, and if this is Cantus Magna, it means he's decided to go all in on this case, no matter what he's been doing. Surely they're going to focus all their resources on Richie's tomb now, and even if they don't, there's no telling what might happen if he salivates at the bait we've laid out."

At Lucinil's words, Galarsh crossed his arms and nodded.

"That's important, but more important is the fact that the full force of the Empire is headed there. The tomb will be breached, and I doubt we'll be able to save the mages of Cantus Magna."

Just as the Temple's banner was raised with the goal of fostering excellence regardless of status, so too is Shanapelle and the Imperial Mage Corps a home for such "fostered" talent.

They are humanity's strongest group, filled with individuals of exceptional talent and aptitude, as well as proven loyalty to humanity and the Empire.

No secret society, no matter how powerful, can match the concentration of power in one place by a group of sifted and filtered superhumans.

From there, they take out key members of the Cantus Magna without killing them.

"Maybe we shouldn't bet on such a low probability and just pull out, because if we bleed to death trying to get to the clue that is Cantus Magna, we might not be able to get back?"

Lerouen said it might be best to consider pulling out.

Initially, only Elise, Lucinil, and Antrianus were fully committed to working with the council.

Galarsh and Llewellyn had agreed to cooperate as much as they could, but they weren't willing to give their lives for Valier.

I was willing to walk away if things got too dangerous.

Lerouen's judgment is not entirely unreasonable, as taking on Cantus Magna and the Empire at the same time to learn the truth about a mysterious artifact called Akasha would be insanity beyond measure.

"I agree with Lerouen. If it's just Cantus Magna, it's too much of a risk to take on the Empire."

Galarsch said.

At that, Sarkegar, in the form of a normal human male, spoke up, his voice filled with concern.

"But didn't our lord say he was heading to that place?"

"Right."

Lucinil nodded at Sarkegar's words.

"We're heading to the tomb with Imperial forces, so her safety shouldn't be too much of a threat, but we don't know how much power Cantus Magna will bring to the table, so we can't be entirely sure. And even if we do go, we may not necessarily be in the fight. We can watch from a distance and intervene if it seems like we're needed. And, well, if they've captured a mage from Cantus Magna, we might be able to sneak up on them later."

Lucinil stares at Sarkegar.

"You're not good at that, are you?"

Lucinil and Sarkegar had met a few times to keep in touch, so Lucinil was already familiar with Sarkegar's power.

Sarkegarda is better at camouflage and infiltration than direct combat.

"They deserve to be called experts."

At this confident statement, Eppinhauser stared at Sarkeghar. But he didn't really say anything.

"I'm sure the Imperials would rather capture them than kill them all, and it's never too late to find out why they did what they did and hang them, but Cantus Magna has decided to go all out, so we need to be ready."

"Lucinil, are you saying you're going to be there?"

At Lucinil's words, Lerouen stared at the silver-haired girl, puzzled.

"Yeah, I'm gonna do that."

"I don't understand why Rusinil is so eager to defend his......."

Lucinil crossed her arms at Lerouen's words.

"Pretty girls are meant to be given rice cakes, and I think we have enough pretty girls in Bali."

Lucinil smirked, and Lerouen sighed heavily, as if he didn't understand.

It just so happens that Lucinil is organizing the meeting.

There are six of us in the room.

Roussinil, Ellerys, Sarkozy, Effinghauser, Leroux, Galarsch.

We decided that someone would keep an eye on the situation and intervene if necessary, just in case something happened to Richie's grave.

"I'm going anyway, raise your hand if you're not going to be there."

At that, Lerouen threw up his hands.

"......?"

Lerouen was the only one to raise his hand.

"......Galarsh, are you so old you're deaf?"

To the oldest vampire, who was seriously worried about the aging of vampires, Galarsh simply replied, "I'm not.

"I'm going to go."

"Is that ......?"

Like Lerouen, Galarsch is not one to cooperate with Valier, so it was expected that he would be absent, but he comes along.

Lerouen watches Galarsh's vicious expression.

Galarsh is staring at Lucinil, who is shivering. It's clear that he's following her because he's worried about her.

"Ah, this disingenuous monster......."

"Loud, ears."

"What, what?! Cute?"

"You're the one who called me a monster first."

Effinghauser could only watch as the elves and orc vampires bickered.

In the end, it was decided that all but Lerouen would go to the field.

"I'm not usually this swept up in things....... Obviously not......."

Lerouen muttered under his breath, feeling a bit out of place when everyone else was going and he didn't want to be left out when it wasn't his decision to make.

"No, Lerouen, you're the kind of person who gets swept away."

Rusinil said.

"Well, it certainly does."

Eleris added.

"In my judgment, having seen you long enough to know, you're no good."

And to the very end of Galash.

With memories reset in 200-year increments, the Lord Vampires, who had been watching Lerouen for longer than he had, were more accurate.

Knowing that made the elven vampire's already pale complexion turn even whiter.

"G....... Really?"

"Yeah, that's always my reaction when I realize that you think you have a strong point of view, but you're really just a go-getter."

Lerouen's jaw dropped at Lucinil's words.

"Do you think I....... can't......?"

In fact, Lerouen has no intention of cooperating with Valier, but when Galarsch decides to join Valier's side, he reluctantly agrees.

Eventually.

It was decided that Lerouen, who had no sticks, would go with them to Richie's grave.
