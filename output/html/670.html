What I heard was, unmistakably, Ellen's voice.

I couldn't help but be surprised.

And it was the same for the other side.

It stood there, dead-eyed, its hand trembling as it held a sword to my throat.

It's something we've done time and time again.

Like fighting Ellen's way, but without her will.

After a battle of inertia that I've fought time and time again, Ellen stopped, not shoving her sword into my throat.

I've always been on the losing end.

Ellen has always won.

Just as it had become habitual for me to lose to Ellen, it had become habitual for her to win against me.

So, the habit of stopping at the last minute was still there.

I said the words I always say, and they slipped out without me realizing it.

"Ugh....... Ugh......! Ugh......! Black! Hmph!"

Unbearable tears flowed from Ellen's dead eyes.

Tears mixed with rainwater flowed down my cheeks.

Something that shouldn't be crying is crying.

Not tears of frustration and anger.

I'm just crying because I'm sad.

"Ellen......?"

"Black......! Ew, ew, ew, ew. Ah....... Ugh......."

We don't know what's going on.

However, in the silence, I could hear a fierce struggle.

It's not completely gone.

Clearly, there's still an Ellen in there somewhere.

Yes.

Luna said she could give Ellen back.

Even though we haven't actually borrowed Luna's power, that already tells us that we can get Ellen back.

And I said that that one could give Ellen back in the first place.

Ellen didn't disappear.

It's just that I'm weak.

It's just that I'm weak and can't take it back.

Luna can give it back, and it can give itself back.

It's just that I can't find it.

I can get Ellen back intact, and she's still in there somewhere.

Clenching her teeth, trying to do something about it, but unable to do anything, she cries.

Suffer.

-Currrrr!

An off-white stream of air begins to rise from Ellen's body.

"Off......eh......eh......!"

Hold your head in a bun.

"흐....... black....... Heh......eh...... ugh. Ugh!"

-Crunch!

With a torrent of souls that seemed to have lost their minds, a shockwave hit me that threatened to tear apart the earth around me and crush my body.

I wonder how many tens of meters we've been pushed back.

I'm pushed out of the way, barely able to get to my feet, and Ellen grabs my head in a torrent that feels like something is pouring out of me.

-Currrrrr!

Amidst the earthquake-like rumbling of the ground, something was welling up inside of it.

"Kill....... kill....... I have to kill....... You too....... And the warrior....... All that you love. All that is dear to you....... You must take it....... Is that....... It's only fair....... Even so....... you have to......."

It glares at me, clutching its broken sword, spirits radiating from its body.

You don't know if it's bad or good.

If it gets worse, is it good for me?

A torrent of spirit surges through Ellen's body, and she doesn't know if it's escaping or running wild.

But the harsh gray torrent rising from the broken sword made it clear that it was as dangerous to me as it was to him.

If you get too close, you might get killed.

But a strong sense that it's now or never.

It was definitely there.

How to combat it.

I don't know.

How to kill that thing.

I don't know.

But I do know this.

Having been consumed by it, having had my soul attacked by the power of the strange sword it wielded, I knew one thing.

It can kill the living, but it can't kill the soul.

You can inhabit something and take control of its body, but you can't kill the original owner of the soul.

If that were possible, it would have killed my soul the moment it entered me from the beginning.

The failure to do so means that, while it is a collection of souls, it can never be killed or destroyed as a soul.

I am the proof that I was swallowed by it and not killed.

The fact that Ellen's spirit is still out there somewhere proves it.

So.

Go.

-Currrrr!

Toward it that rushes at me, wrapped in the torrent of a wild soul.

It doesn't back away, it moves closer.

-Quadruple!

It wasn't just the mind that was being attacked, but the sword felt like a huge physical pressure.

-Currrrr!

The raindrops were being pushed back by sheer force of physics without even reaching us.

From the broken sword against Tiamata, wild flames erupted as the pressure of the surging spirits clashed with Tiamata's divine power.

We don't know if the spirits are extinguished flames or physical flames.

The flames of the demon enveloped me, and I felt like my reason was being blown away by the pain that threatened to tear my brain apart.

In the torrent of the soul, it tries to kill me somehow, like squeezing out the last spark.

A pain that feels like it will tear my soul apart, and a different kind of pain that threatens to tear my heart out.

But.

Pain may weaken the soul, but I know it won't kill me.

The Voidblade cuts through my flesh.

Though that sword of resentment attacks my soul.

You can never kill a soul.

You don't have to break down in pain and fear.

-Carded!

I know.

You can't win.

I've never won, not even once.

For the unknowing Ellen, the days of learning to wield a sword while hiding the fact that she was a demon were always like that.

He didn't learn the sword so that he could later fight Ellen and win.

This is how we ended up fighting.

It was always my job to lose badly when Ellen came out with her heart on her sleeve.

Only defeat was mine.

But it wasn't always the same defeat.

One sum, then two sums, then three sums, then four sums.

Before I knew it, I was able to fight for about ten minutes.

"It's hard.

We'll have an Alsbringer. Ellen once said that because she was tired of dealing with me.

I always lost.

It always fell.

I was a progressive loser.

I knew I couldn't win, but I gritted my teeth and tried.

I didn't get stronger to fight Ellen, but I did it for what was going to happen one day.

I've been losing to you my whole life.

-Currrrr!

As we locked swords in the raging torrent, I looked into Ellen's eyes, filled with hatred and rage, as she somehow managed to push my sword away and go for my throat.

Say.

"Only once......."

Since the Gate debacle, I've shed tears that I've never shed before.

"Perfect."

Eventually, it can't hold it in and bursts out.

"Really, just once......."

I didn't cry because I knew tears wouldn't change anything.

"Because it's good for once."

So desperate.

So desperate.

Eventually, the tears come.

In a storm that tears at the soul, where the tears that fall are lost in the torrent of the soul.

"If I....... win....... why not......?"

Only once.

For now, when it matters most, we want to win.

I can win now, or I can spend the rest of my life losing to you.

If you lose now.

From now on, you can't lose even if you want to.

I can spend the rest of my life beating the crap out of you like I did at Temple.

"So......."

That eternity.

It's enough to get all that time back.

To my self-implication.

I call out to my spirits.

Just this once.

Only once.

"I am......."

For now.

"null......."

No matter what.

"Win."

will win.

-Crunch!

"Off......u.......h......aahhhhhh!"

It's facing some kind of limit, and its behavior is getting wilder and wilder.

-Bang!

Instead of blocking the upward slash, step back to avoid it.

No matter what power is imbued in a weapon, its absolute limits remain unchanged.

Broken Sword.

There are limits to that.

He lunges and deflects the incoming sword this time.

It fights with Ellen's senses, but in the end, the thing that owns the body is clearly confused.

Dulled.

Ellen Artorius, I know my sword better than anyone in the world.

But eventually.

Because.

I know Ellen's sword better than anyone in the world.

It's me again.

He deflects the sword in front of him and somehow manages to go for my throat this time.

You parry my sword and then duck to avoid a swipe at your neck, lowering your stance.

Avoid the knee that will shoot up toward you as you lower your stance, and turn your head to avoid it.

That distorted face, crazed with confusion, anger, and despair, is right in front of me.

"Ugh......h......black!"

A sword stabbing through pain and despair.

But I know this interval won't come back, so I'm right.

-Poof!

"......!"

The sword that stabs me in the heart, I don't block it.

An eerie pain stabs at my brain, but it's nothing compared to the pressure on my soul right now.

Rather, it pulls.

Pull that poked arm out.

-Bam!

Grab it by the throat.

"Ouch!"

-Currrrr!

There's no getting away from it.

I'm willing to be stabbed in the heart a few times for the sake of one victory.

Dozens of times, hundreds of times.

Thousands of times.

I would have done anything and everything to get you back.

This is probably about right.

The torrent of souls pummels my body with physical force, but my body breaks and regenerates at the same time.

If I don't kill on the first hit, I play forever.

I can do that because I still have my holy relics.

For the sake of a single victory.

For a one-time opportunity.

I've been waiting for this moment of weakness.

Without sacrificing Luna.

Without sacrificing myself.

I grit my teeth and let go of countless opportunities because I knew this moment would come.

I'm going to do something now or never.

Toward it, struggling with its grip around my neck, as if to tell me to let go.

Toward Ellen.

Everything I've ever done to kill monsters.

All of my achievement points that I hadn't spent in a very long time for this moment.

Write now.

To get you back.

And maybe.

which will be the last.



[Use all 287,620 achievement points].



"Retire.

"Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"

Since then, there's been no such thing as unearthly powers.

It doesn't need to be self-suggesting.

These powers can be the last to go.

Because we don't need it anymore.

Now more than ever.

More than any other moment.

Desperate.

With the most powerful salts.



Barely (自己暗示)



I command you (言靈)



With that said.



"Disappear!"
