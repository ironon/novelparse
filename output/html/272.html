This is an unfamiliar ceiling.

This time it's really a strange ceiling.

No, it's not a ceiling in the first place.

I see something like a silk tent.

What is this.

How is the bed so big?

I pulled myself up and looked around.

That's an unfamiliar ceiling.

The room is not unfamiliar.

"......."

Here, I think this is Charlotte's bedroom?

Once I walked in, the view of the room was instantly recognizable.

I think I was sleeping in Charlotte's giant canopy bed right now.

"Hey, you're up!"

And Charlotte, who had seen me rise from a distance, practically threw herself at me and hugged me.

That's a big bed.

He's been watching me from the edge of my bed, and I've had to jump on the bed to get to him.

"Uh, uh....... Uh, yeah."

"It's okay. Does it hurt anywhere? Are your eyes or hands okay?"

"Uh, uh....... Yeah. Sounds good."

"Thank goodness....... Thank goodness......."

I wasn't worried about being sick, but I wasn't expecting to be, either, and unlike the last time I'd been enchanted, I was in near perfect condition. Charlotte hugged me, then pulled away slightly and looked at me.

Charlotte had tears in her eyes.

"That's good, that's really good, Reinhard."

"Uh....... Um. Uh, yeah. You okay?"

"Yeah. It's okay."

Charlotte hugged me once more, clear tears streaming down her face.

Charlotte didn't criticize or say anything else.

He didn't say anything for a while, just hugged me like he was glad I was okay.

At first I thought it was a bit of a whimper.

"Black....... ugh....... ugh......."

I cried a little, and Charlotte was overcome with emotion. I didn't know what to do, so I patted her on the back.

"Well, by the way....... That's all well and good, but it's not the first time I've done this, is it?"

"Ugh, ugh....... ugh......."

"It's been a few days since I passed out, and I need to know how things are going....... know."

I'm the kind of person who faints at the slightest hint of an unfamiliar ceiling quota, and when I wake up, the first thing I want to know is what's going on.

First of all, waking up in the Empress's bedchamber was a strange experience.

"Okay, wait a minute......."

Charlotte seemed to think she needed to stop crying first, so she took a long, hard breath and pulled away from me. Charlotte's eyes widened, and she covered her own.

"......were you swollen?"

"......would you like to pour it in?"

Uh, honestly, I just poured it in.

She can pour. She can pour. Charlotte lowered the hand that covered her eyes.

"Not much time has passed. Work was yesterday, and it's Friday. You're in my bedroom because....... I don't want anyone else to know you're in my palace."

I passed out on Wednesday, so I skipped Thursday, and then Friday.

"Fortunately, it was raining heavily and there was a severe thunderstorm, so we don't know what happened back then. Only you, me, and Lord Tana know what happened, since everything was bitten, including people and surveillance magic. The palace was pretty badly damaged, but....... That's none of your concern."

Saviolin Tana took the blame for what I did. But neither Charlotte nor Tana will ever know what really happened.

"I thought it would be best to keep it a secret that you were there, so I put you to sleep in my bedroom. The treatment was....... I thought about calling a priest, even though it's a little risky, but then I remembered....... elixir."

"......elixir?"

"Yes."

If it's an elixir, is it the elixir I think it is?

That's a national treasure that I know the empire doesn't have a few bottles of, so it's not like it's just a potion or something?

For some reason, I felt too well.

"Can I use that?"

"Why is this ......?"

I was strangely moved by his words.

"And it was Lord Tana who brought it, not me."

Cancel Impressions.

Chanapelle could have brought a bottle of elixir to use on her own.

I'm fine, by the way, but is he? I think he's fine, based on Charlotte's reaction.

-Your Highness, may I enter?

Too scared to speak, I heard Savior Tana's voice on the other side of the door. Charlotte looked at me.

I think it's a sign that it's okay to let them in.

What is.

She owns the room, but why is she asking for my permission?

I feel weird!

I nodded, and just as Charlotte called out that she could come in, Tana, a savior in full regalia, walked into Charlotte's bedroom.

"...... is up."

"Oh, yeah."

She didn't say much as she watched me sit nonchalantly on Charlotte's bed.

Charlotte, Tana, and I had a lot of questions.

How did Tiamata get there, what happened to her after she passed out, etc.

She pulled up a chair and sat down on the bed.

......Multi.

I'm sitting next to her, but we're far apart. Charlotte, who was sitting next to me, also scratched her cheek.

"......I need to change my bed."

An overly large and uncomfortable bed.

It didn't take long for me to realize why Charlotte was experiencing a new world from her dorm bed.

"I'm not even sick, let's sit around and talk."

I got off the bed and sat down on the couch.

Charlotte sat at the head table, and me and Tana sat across from her.

"First, I want to say thank you, Reinhardt. I don't know the details, but you saved my life and yours that day."

Despite the damage to the palace, Saviolin Tana would not have informed Charlotte that she had been overpowered in battle that day. If she had, Charlotte would not have been in her palace.

She would have made a false report. Tana's words sober Charlotte and she looks at me.

"I didn't say hello properly either. Thank you so much, Reinhard."

Charlotte smiles at me.

It wasn't the grotesque, eerie smile that Charlotte had displayed when she was consumed by power.

Yes.

I wanted Charlotte to keep showing me that smile.

Awakening an Elemental is secondary.

It wasn't about power, it was about Charlotte.

"Before you ask me anything, I'd like to know what's going on."

I stare at Charlotte.

"Your problem, is it solved?"

I awakened the spirit.

It took control of Charlotte's body and ordered her to disappear.

Is it, is it really gone?

I wanted to know something before it was explained to me. Charlotte gave me an ambiguous look.

"I don't know, but I was fine yesterday and....... That....... I have a feeling that's hard to put into words. It's unbearable. It's like something is eating me up. It's like anxiety, it's like a crisis, it's like something that's been bothering me at night, and it's gone, all of a sudden."

"And the ability itself?"

"Remain that."

My anxiety is gone. I don't know if that's enough, but it means Charlotte is safe for now.

The power to manipulate shadows remains. It's a source of anxiety. Charlotte is reluctant to use her powers, so she hasn't demonstrated them.

I finally understand why Charlotte hated her powers. Who likes a power that eats you up?

"Aye. We'll have to wait and see, but it's clear that something has changed in your Majesty. We've tried everything we can think of, both magical and divine. But none of it has worked."

Tana and Charlotte look at me.

"Reinhardt. What the hell did you do?"

Words.

It has already become my strength.

So that will show up in the physical scan.

"Apparently, my superpowers have gotten a little stronger."

I'm sure it will be judged as an overly dangerous power, but since I can't hide it, I had to tell the truth.



* * *



I outlined the situation.

The first thing I explained was Tiamata's case.

A sword of evil power from the Darklands.

For that matter, it was easy to tell Charlotte because she already knew. I told her that a supposedly demonic holy object had incompletely bonded with me, and that I had purified it to see what I could do, and that it had turned into Tiamata.

I left out the part about there being no distinction between demons and gods. It just said that Tiamata had fallen.

Along the way, I couldn't help but bring up Olivia Ranze's story.

Tana and Charlotte both froze at my words.

That Tiamata can be corrupted, and the me that is chosen by it.

"This is....... It's complicated to explain, so we had to keep it a secret."

"...... would have been."

"This is the kind of thing that would turn the religious world upside down......."

It took us both quite a while to recover from the shock.

Either way, the result was the result, and neither of them argued about it. Charlotte was grateful to be told, as if it would put her mind at ease about the sudden disappearance of the demonic artifact.

And superpowers.

I don't want you to have to figure out the concept of a spirit on your own, so I've been a bit vague.

She also explained the fight over something that controlled Charlotte.

I yelled for it to go away, and it did.

There was only one logic.

"Like being able to use self-implication on others?"

"Because otherwise the situation doesn't make sense."

The implications for yourself are now applicable to others.

Unicorns are a concept not unlike that.

I realize that self-suggestion is a power manifested by faith, whereas unction is a slightly different concept, manifested by a command or declaration.

"The answer is....... superpower."

Superpowers are described by the phrase "whatever.

It is inexplicable, and the miracles it creates are manifested in a logic that is out of this world.

That's why solving Charlotte's problem, which could not be solved in any other way, makes sense to me, even if I don't understand it.

It's hard for Tana to accept the fact that this ridiculous situation is now making sense, but she looks like she's been through hell and found the exit.

"That means....... that you are the only one who can heal his condition."

"......Maybe."

Charlotte's condition, which had been creeping up on her, is now under control, but there's no telling what will happen later. I'm the only one prepared for it.

For example, would I be Charlotte's primary care physician?

But Charlotte's expression was serious.

"It's a dangerous ability, just as dangerous as mine, if not more so."

The evolution of self-implication.

It has become so dangerous that it can be applied to others, not just yourself.

Self-insinuation and subtext were not in the original.

So I don't even know what this power is capable of. Right now, it's not absolute, but as the level of power increases. the unthinkable may be possible.

Of course, Charlotte wasn't thinking that my power was dangerous and she needed to get rid of me.

"Yes. I don't know how that ability will be measured, but I'll instruct the Temple to keep your new power a secret."

To protect myself, I was to keep my new powers a closely guarded secret. I would keep Temple's mouth shut, and if anyone knew, it would be Dr. Epinhauser.

It's actually a dangerous ability, and if we're talking about yesterday's fight, I took down Charlotte, who Savior Tana couldn't take down.

If Xavier Tana had a tiara, or a high-ranking paladin, the story might have been different.

In many ways, she was fighting at her worst against a bad matchup.

Keep your new powers a secret. It would be better that way. Tana seemed to have other ideas.

"Why don't we let Reinhardt stay at the Palace of Spring?"

I'm not sure if Charlotte's condition has truly improved. Since we don't know what will happen at any given time, I, the only one who can act on it, stay at the Palace of Spring and live with Charlotte.

It wouldn't look good on the outside, but the emperor wouldn't object if the empress's life depended on it.

"No, you can't. No matter how much you hide it, Reinhardt is in the same class as Bertus, and if you live like that, one day Bertus will find out, and then Reinhardt will be in danger."

"......Yes."

Charlotte was putting my safety first.

The fact that I had saved Charlotte and the battle of the previous day had not been made known, not to mention the reward I would receive if it became known that I had saved Charlotte, was because I thought Bertus might try to get rid of me.

Bertus won't even know I'm in the palace.

"In the first place, does Bertus know your condition?"

"You don't know the details, but you know I'm not going to live long."

It would be rather odd for Bertus to not know about this situation.

There's no need to keep someone who's going to bend over backwards on their own. That's probably why there have been so few arguments between them lately.

But I saved Charlotte's life. I thought she would fall on her own, so I brought her back to life.

I'd be dead to Bertus if he found out.

That's why Charlotte made the pretty bold choice to let me sleep in her bedroom. It would be dangerous for Bertus to know I was here.

"But....... Reinhardt is the only one who can guarantee your safety at this point."

She was forced to admit that she couldn't protect Charlotte, and the imperial family couldn't do anything about it.

There is no place in the world where Charlotte is safe. Only with me by her side can she be safe.

"Back to the templates, again."

"......."

I can't live on Jupiter.

So there was no choice but for Charlotte to come back to Temple and live in the dorms with me.

Savior Tana could only nod in the end, knowing that it was the best choice for me and for Charlotte.



* * *



It's only one day.

Neither Tana nor Charlotte thought that just because it was one day without incident that it would be okay for the rest of their lives.

"Reinhardt."

"Yes, Lord Tana."

"About this, I must keep a secret from everyone else, but I must report to the king."

"......."

"My personal loyalties aside, it is only then that I can convince your highness that your condition has improved. I suggest you write to His Majesty at....... so that you may realize that your actions are no longer necessary."

Charlotte looks at me.

Her face was full of regret. Saviolin Tana is not Charlotte's person, but the Emperor's. She is responsible for the safety of the Empress for now, but in the end, her master is the Emperor.

There shouldn't be any secrets you can't tell the Emperor. After all, this is for Charlotte's own good.

Things have gotten so intertwined that I, a demon prince, now have a contact with the Emperor.

"That's fine."

"I will do my best to keep you out of harm's way. I swear it on my honor."

The oath of the strongest woman on the continent. She will lay down her life for me if it puts me in danger.

Because that's what an oath on her honor is.

"In addition to your Majesty, you saved my life."

She bowed her head abruptly.

"For that, I am truly grateful."

"Uh, what....... I don't think you're going to do this......."

Her head was bowed, and her gratitude was genuine.

Saviolin Tana left, promising to report her findings to the Emperor.

It was just me and Charlotte in the bedroom. Charlotte fetched a tea set, brewed the tea skillfully on her own, and offered me a cup.

"I didn't think about Bertus when I brought you to the Yellow Castle, because I didn't have to."

Charlotte thought she was going to die soon, so she didn't care if Bertus found out she'd brought me to the Palace of Spring. It doesn't matter who you're friends with when you're a worthless rival anyway.

"Reinhardt. To put it bluntly, saving my life is going to reflect poorly on you."

It was your mistake that saved my life.

Charlotte was nonchalant about it. I narrowed my eyes at Charlotte's sad smile.

"I don't need to hear that."

"......."

"I'll do it again the next time it happens."

Charlotte seems taken aback by my comment. I smirk and look at Charlotte, who remains still, clutching her teacup.

"Oh well. I was right after all."

I told Charlotte that I would save you.

When asked how, he said he'd figure it out.

Anyone can say that, Charlotte said pessimistically.

But in the end, I saved Charlotte. Charlotte stared at her teacup in confusion for a moment, then gave a small nod.

"Right....... I'm sorry, I didn't trust you."

"From now on, if I say something, it's just that. I'm not wrong. I'm always right."

At my bullshit, Charlotte grinned at me.

"Yes, I trust you. Always."

I was stumped because I didn't expect this answer.

Charlotte took a sip of her tea, and I took a sip of the milk tea she poured.

"Anyway, I don't know what's going to happen, but now that I'm alive, Bertus will try to find a reason, and even if he can't actually harm me, he'll be wary again, so... don't let it get out that you were in the Palace of Spring. Fortunately, I've expunged your entry and exit records, and very few people have seen you, so Bertus won't know who was here or what happened yet."

"......That's good."

"So. You're not allowed to leave Huangshan."

I couldn't help but be dumbfounded by the sound.

No, you said I shouldn't be living in the Palace of Spring. If I'm not supposed to leave the Yellow City, does that mean I'm supposed to stay here?

Did I lie to Saviolin Tana?

Charlotte smiled wryly, as if she knew what I was talking about.

"Idiot, you know that."

Where Charlotte gestured was the wall of her bedroom.

Secret Passage.

The basement is equipped with a warp gate.

"Go out that way, and you'll be able to get to the gate in the ecliptic, and you know that gates are heavily monitored on the way in, but less so on the way out, right?"

The way out of Huangshan without anyone noticing was in Charlotte's bedroom.

"And this."

Charlotte went somewhere in the room, opened a magical safe, and handed me something.

It was a small golden brooch.

"What is this?"

"Gates are two-way, right?"

"......, right?"

"If you can get out, you can get in, right?"

Charlotte showed me how to operate the brooch. It seemed to work by opening the brooch and pressing a switch or something.

"Activate this brooch, go through any warp gate in the ecliptic, and it will lead you to a warp gate in the basement of the Palace of Spring."

"......."

Charlotte squeezed it into my hand, then took mine.

Charlotte's hands were shaking slightly.

"I....... I'm giving you something that can come into my bedroom right now....... at any time. Without anyone knowing. You can come in......."

Charlotte's face was flushed, and her voice was shaking even more violently.

It's not something you can give to just anyone.

Or is it something you've given to someone?

It was like a secret key to sneaking into the Yellow City without anyone noticing.

"What does this mean....... Do you understand?"

Charlotte couldn't even look at me properly.

"That means you trust me, right?"

"......."

Charlotte glares at me.

His lips were pouting out.

"Yeah, I'll call you whenever I need you, and you can come over and help me out."

Charlotte pouted a little, crossed her arms, and stared out the window for a while.

I could have sworn I saw red water dripping from his face.

"This gift is for....... Don't throw it away."

Charlotte says in a shaky voice. Is she thinking about what I said before I passed out?

I honestly don't remember much of what I said at the time, as I was on the verge of losing consciousness.

"Of course."

In exchange for throwing away the gift Charlotte had given him in anticipation of their breakup.

I was given an item that would allow me to meet Charlotte at any time.
