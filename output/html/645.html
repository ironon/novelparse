After a while.

Ludwig returned from a short walk.

Technically, I was just stopping by Hogwarts, but it didn't take long.

I couldn't stay away for long because of my anxiety.

Scarlett was now in a very dangerous situation.

It's no wonder Scarlett is upset, because I've just told her to do as I say without explaining the situation to her.

So it was natural to give them time to think about it, but I couldn't give them too much time.

Back at the Temple dormitory, Ludwig knocked cautiously on Scarlett's door.

"Scarlett, it's me."

Ludwig stood before the door and waited in silence.

There was no answer.

I wonder if he's thinking about something other than his room.

-Smart

"Scarlet."

He knocked again, but Ludwig didn't hear an answer.

Ludwig stands still at the door, waiting for an answer.

-Smart

Then, three times.

Ludwig's expression hardened.

Ludwig knows.

In the first place, there is no popularity contest in the room.

I knocked on the door just in case.

Ludwig knew that Scarlett wasn't in the room.

"......."

If.

No way.

It can't be.

Never.

It can't be.

Scarlett can't do that.

Ludwig reverts to himself, as if hypnotized.

As he thought about it, Ludwig's eyes sank deeper and deeper into the abyss.

If yes.

What to do.

I don't know how.

How does Scarlett.

No.

Scarlett' to 'How.

Should I?

"......."

Just in time for the ominous shadow of his mind to move on to the idea that Ludwig must make an ominous decision.

"Ludwig."

Ludwig turned his head at the pretense of popularity in the lobby, which was oddly not a visit.

In the lobby, Scarlett walked in, dragging a huge trunk.

"I need to grab something."

The words were barely audible to Ludwig.

Ludwig continues to walk toward Scarlett.

Scarlett couldn't help but panic as Ludwig strode toward her.

Seeing that frighteningly hardened expression, Scarlett involuntarily took a small step backward.

"Ludwig......? Why do you look like that......."

-Wrong!

"!"

Ludwig did as he was told, hugging Scarlett roughly.

Scarlett was understandably taken aback by Ludwig's sudden embrace.

"Why, why suddenly......."

"Good."

"Is that ......?"

"Good."

Scarlett could feel Ludwig's heart beating so fiercely in her embrace that she thought it might burst, even though it wasn't hers.

What the heck is good about that.

What on earth are you so relieved about.

"Thank goodness....... I'm so glad......."

Scarlet is unknown, but.

Somehow.

I think I know a little bit.

Scarlett couldn't help but shiver a little.

"Zee, calm down. I....... I'm not going anywhere."

Scarlett pulled a relieved Ludwig into a hug and gently patted his back.

Hugging him, Scarlett couldn't see how violently Ludwig's eyes were shaking.

"Thank goodness....... Scarlett......."

Because you don't have to think about it.

Because you don't have to imagine something.

Ludwig muttered the same words over and over again, like a madman.

Scarlett hadn't suddenly disappeared, as Ludwig had ominously imagined.

He had to go somewhere to get something, and he was dragging a huge trunk with him.

"You said you didn't have time, so let's go."

"Ah....... Yeah. Let's go, Scarlett."

As if to say calm down.

He says he's not going anywhere, and Scarlett hugs Ludwig and pats him on the back reassuringly.

Scarlett didn't ask any more questions or argue, just packed up her things.

But Ludwig was thinking that Scarlett might have disappeared.

I was thinking about what to do then.

If Scarlett is gone, you're thinking about something else.

What to do then.

I was imagining what I should do with Scarlett.

For a moment, he doubted Scarlett's willingness to follow his lead.

I wasn't just suspicious, I was terrified.

"Sorry, Scarlett. I'm sorry......."

"No......."

Hearing Ludwig's suddenly apologetic voice, Scarlett hugs him harder.

Just as Scarlett can't see Ludwig's wavering eyes because they're hugging each other.

'I'm sorry I....... I'm more sorry.......'

Ludwig couldn't see Scarlett's expression, either.



* * *



Ludwig and Scarlett were walking out of the Royal Class dormitory.

Aside from Ludwig's relief that his ominous imagination hadn't been realized, he couldn't help but wonder.

"But what did you go outside to get?"

The only thing I need to pack is my clothes, which should be in Scarlett's room, but I found them in the lobby.

"Oh, I got some books from the library, I think....... Ludwig won't tell me, but I think I'll be here a while."

"I see......."

Even if you don't tell him anything, he knows he'll be leaving the Temple for quite some time.

Ludwig had to admit that he had brought a book to pass the time.

"Ludwig will take care of the return, right?"

Scarlett looks at Ludwig with a grim expression.

Returning a book.

Ludwig grinned bitterly, knowing that Scarlett was being deliberately oblivious.

"I'll drop it off at ......, and if you need anything, I'll get it for you."

"You mean it doesn't have to be a book?"

"Of course."

In a world where there's not much to be had, he'd take whatever was within his reach.

Naturally, I was grateful. When he offers to help me find a place to hide in case someone tries to take advantage of your powers, I graciously oblige.

"But what about the cat? I guess I can take it with me."

Ludwig was puzzled that Scarlett had brought the cat with her on the last walk, but not now.

Maybe not for humans, but for cats.

You're definitely going to be bored.

"He was just hanging out with me for a while, and he's not even my cat. Wouldn't it be better if he stayed in the Temple dorms?"

"Oh....... I see, Scarlett had just gotten back."

"Right."

Scarlett stays still and watches the entrance to the temple draw near.

Someone who tells you nothing.

A person who lies with a straight face.

Who's the worse person.

Obviously, it's the latter.

Scarlett thought so.



* * *



As soon as Scarlett stepped outside the temple, she was confronted by a mage in robes.

He was a nondescript wizard in plain gray robes.

Scarlett didn't ask Ludwig anything, and Ludwig was secretly grateful to Scarlett for not asking.

But Scarlett knew who was in front of her.

No, who wouldn't be the right word.

I knew the 'what'.

An army of the dead.

When I didn't know what it was, I wanted it, but now that I do, I can't help but feel creeped out by it.

To end the war, they dabbled in dangerous magic, and what you see before you is only a small part of the result.

-Flash!

With her teleportation spell, Scarlett was able to arrive in a room she had never seen before.

Scarlett's destination wasn't a street, but a room in a building.

Scarlett looks around in a spacious but unfamiliar room.

I couldn't help but recognize the features of the room I was in.

No windows.

You don't even know if it's underground or above ground.

"Ludwig, this is....... Where are you?"

Scarlet couldn't tell if this was somewhere inside the ecliptic, or even if it was some other city.

When Scarlett asks where she is, Ludwig stays still and grabs her shoulder.

"Scarlet."

"It's ......."

"Just be patient. I'm never, ever going to let you stay here long."

Make a promise, not an answer to a question.

Ludwig's words say it all.

The implication here is that you have to live like a prisoner.

Ludwig explains things to Scarlett.

To tell the person guarding the door if you lack or need anything, and if something happens.

That there is plenty of food and other things to eat.

"You know that....... that we're not supposed to leave?"

Ludwig lowered his eyes at Scarlett's question, which was finally asked bluntly.

"Sorry, all to protect you......."

Ludwig was about to say something like that, but then he shut his mouth.

As if he can't stand the thought of putting words in his mouth on the subject of locking up his friends.

"I'm sorry."

"......I can't help it."

Those words of inevitability, coming out of Scarlett's mouth, sounded so much like something Ludwig had once said.



* * *



Ludwig went home.

An army called Immortals.

Scarlett now realizes that it was the army that said they were rear-guard troops.

Ludwig would have been fighting on the front lines, not in the rear. He would have been fighting in the most dangerous places.

Even the Devil and Ludwig do what they can.

And Scarlett, too, chose what she thought was the right thing to do.

Windowless rooms.

The room itself is spacious, with a bathroom, and there doesn't seem to be any inconvenience to living there.

But even though the room was large and spacious, Scarlett found it odd.

It's not exactly a cage.

The furnishings were all made of quality materials.

But the windowlessness, the whole structure of the room, not knowing if it's above or below ground, the soundproofing. There's something about those things that you feel.

It doesn't look like a prison, but it is a room made to be a prison.

A prison built to hold inmates who are difficult to handle.

I wonder who these rooms were for before the Gate debacle.

Scarlet doesn't know.

But you have to accept what has happened and live with it.

Scarlett pulls her clothes out of the trunk and begins to organize them.

You're going to be here for a while.

The trunk contained more books than clothes.

Among the miscellaneous books, there are professional books, novels, history books. And there are even dictionaries.

I brought it to kill time.

Scarlett explained.

I honestly felt like it would take me years to read it all.

In a room with no one but herself, Scarlett pulls out one of her usual novels and opens it.

But it didn't say anything about a novel.

Scarlett flips through the pages one by one.

It's any expression or shape that's written there.



[Teleport]

[Mass teleport

[Noise canceling]]



The novel contained not a novel, but a magic scroll.

"I'm sorry, Ludwig.

Scarlett tucked the scrollbook, carefully disguised as a novel, into a stack of books in the trunk.

Ludwig imprisons Scarlett in an unnamed prison.

Or, to be more precise, I thought I had.

One item from the demon, a scrollbook.

And the second thing.

Scarlett fiddled with the purple brooch on her arm.

When the time is right, the devil will give the signal.

You can then perform the promised action.

"......."

Before long, Scarlett's hands were drenched in a cold sweat.



* * *



'......I can help.'

After much deliberation, Scarlett decided to help me.

To be honest, I didn't expect Scarlett to be on my side.

But as Scarlett said, just as there were people who didn't understand me, there were also people who did.

And Scarlett was the latter.

I spoke with Charlotte and Harriet after returning to Razak.

"Wouldn't it have been better to bring him in?"

Herriot narrowed his eyes, worried about leaving Scarlett alone.

I gave him a scrollbook and a beeper, and he was nervous to return.

Whether it's available or not, it's dangerous to leave Scarlett alone with them, especially since she's committed to helping us.

"That's what I thought, too."

"......What, you're saying you're staying?"

"Uh."

Charlotte bit her lip.

In class B, Charlotte was best friends with Scarlett.

"It's risky, but it's the smart thing for Scarlett to do at this point."

But despite her misgivings, Charlotte had to admit that Scarlett's decision was for the best.

"Could things get more dangerous if I'm gone?

Scarlett clearly said so.

"Immortals are self-repairing when damaged. Scarlett is the one who can most completely neutralize an Immortal at this point without causing any damage, and if she suddenly disappears....... something more dangerous could happen."

With Christina, Ludwig, and the others in control of Immortal, it's very dangerous to provoke them.

It's in their best interest to keep Scarlett in custody for now, rather than letting the boys, who are excited by her disappearance, do something even more unknown.

Scarlett chose to become a prisoner herself.

I appreciate your offer to help, but you put yourself in the most dangerous situation.

That's why I gave him the scrollbook I carried with me, as well as a signaling device I'd made for Scarlett in case things didn't work out.

If Scarlett is in danger, or if we need her on our end, we'll send a signal.

In the end, Scarlett has to trick her friends.

A friend who needs to be locked up.

And a friend who has to trick a friend who is trying to trap him.

"......Sad."

Charlotte muttered gloomily to herself, unable to bear the current state of affairs of the B-class boys who had once been her classmates.

The possibility of Scarlet's power being channeled through the Archduke.

As soon as he heard the news, he was on the move, reaching Scarlett faster than Ludwig.

What if I was late?

If you arrived at the Royal Class dormitory after Ludwig had disappeared with Scarlett.

If we didn't know where Scarlett went.

I wonder what it was like.

This time it was fast.

That's how we got to Scarlett.

However, as I said myself.

The fact remains that by using Scarlet, you're putting Scarlet at risk.

Round and round and eventually.

Because of me.

Two heroines from the original.

Delphine is dead.

Scarlett must trick Ludwig.

"......."

"Everything will be fine."

I don't know what my expression was, but Harriet gently put her arm around my shoulders.

"Right."

Charlotte sees it, too, and nods her head in agreement.

"Everything will be fine."

Please.

It has to be good.

We say that, but we don't know if it's a certainty or an assertion.

Or a prayer.

It's just the wind.

Now we couldn't tell.
