Eleris didn't look too pleased.

They say it's to catch Cantus Magna, but it's really a plan to artificially create a dungeon that digs an ant-hole and sucks in tons of adventurers.

I'm not sure why I'd want to worry about a bunch of guys getting their heads blown off.

It's bizarre that someone would agree to something that would eventually kill them.

"I'll be back when I'm done."

"Sure."

Antrianus, Galarsh, and Leruen cast their teleports and soon left.

It's just me, Lucinil, and Elise in the council room.

"And Radia?"

"I told him to wait in his room."

I think I'm gonna get psychotic or something if I stay out here in the cold and dark for too long. Are you okay?

I don't really care how Radia is doing, but I think about her when I'm here.

I'm sure Elise is taking good care of her somehow.

It's almost like....... I guess you could say I'm being bred.

Anyway, that's not the problem.

"Okay, Elise and Rusinil, I need you to go somewhere with me for a minute."

"Anything else?"

I nodded at the silver-haired kid's question.

"Let's go to the Demon Castle."

"You mean Demon Castle? That's....... Oh, come to think of it, it's......."

"Yeah. You said there was a shelter or something."

"Yeah, I'm going to go there."

You'll need to organize your fake dungeon and see if there's any magic that can help with camouflage.

But I'm blind to magic, so I don't know if there is such a thing in the Demon Castle. Or if they do, it's already known magic, and the Order might ask me why I brought it.

So, take a couple of Archmage-grade road vampires and you should be able to find something.



* * *



I had told Lucinil about the bunker, and she had told Elise, so I knew about it. I don't know if the other Lord Vampires were informed,

I can't even get to the demon castle bunker on my own.

There are still garrisons there, and since I can't use magic, I can't descend to the sixth floor, where the labyrinth is.

But it's a different story when Lucinil and Elise come along.

The outskirts of Demon City, arrived not through a warp gate but by using a series of teleports.

"That's big."

Lucinil's jaw dropped at the majesty of the Demon City's walls from afar.

A castle that eventually fell.

"Let's go."

The three of us made our way to Mawang Castle, taking care not to be seen by the garrison, including invisibility and noise suppression.

"You don't have to find dangerous magic, it doesn't have to be a dungeon trap or binding. Something that's not too dangerous, but could serve as bait for Cantus Magna."

"Okay."

"Yes, degradation."

The Black Order will put out bait, but we must put out bait as well. Whatever the Black Order's true purpose, it is an ally until we find Cantus Magna and Akasha.

We'll have to think beyond that, but for now, Akasha is our priority.

If I were a mage, I'd think that I couldn't just scatter those bloody grimoires around, but I'm not a mage.

I knew it was valuable, but I didn't want to waste it.

However, I can't take too many books with me. I don't want Charlotte to realize that the book is missing until later, even if she looks at it and realizes that I took it.

Naturally, the garrison didn't recognize us, and I, who knew the way, led the way.

The interior of Mawang was also very large, so we were on the move for quite a while.

The garrison had explored nearly every part of the city except the Labyrinth. And the commander had given up on the search for the Labyrinth, and Charlotte hadn't questioned him about it.

The garrison will soon withdraw, claiming to have found nothing.

Eleris looked at the Demon King and made a sad face.

He hated war, but for some reason he was the only one on the council to swear allegiance to the Demon King, and he became a spy for the Yellow Emperor before returning to the Demon City.

I couldn't tell what Elise was thinking.

"I need to get to the fifth floor of the basement."

You know where to go to find the entrance to the labyrinth.

We walked diligently.

"I don't even need to use invisibility. There's no one there at all, right?"

"I see."

Rusinil let out an exclamation of disbelief. Of course, that doesn't mean I've turned off the invisibility and noise canceling.

The commander, Count Alfrid, seems to think that Charlotte's failure to pursue the matter has given him a virtual free pass.

So exploration has stopped altogether. The garrison is merely hanging around the Demon Castle, waiting to be evacuated.

We soon descended to the fifth level of the demon castle, the warren, and reached the entrance to the labyrinth.

"It's not that big, is it?"

"Isn't that what it's all about?"

"There's this place......."

"It's a labyrinth, but apparently the way is only open if you have an Archdemon."

At the time, I wasn't sure if she had opened the way for Charlotte or me. But unless you're coming with an Archdemon, this passage leads to a labyrinth.

Fortunately, the labyrinth guided me to the exit, even while still in Reinhardt form.

A short distance down the circular staircase, I saw a door at the end of a long, straight hallway.

At least I know that no matter what I look like, the Labyrinth will take me to the right place.

But what if Charlotte came alone?

I wasn't sure about that yet.

Elise and Lucinil followed.

-delay

I opened the door and found myself in the space I had reached earlier with Charlotte and Saviolin Tana.

"Wow, what's all this?"

Lucinil's eyes widened as she reached the giant cavity and looked around.

Elise was equally bewildered by the passageways and rooms.

"Mawang Castle....... Since when is this place......."

Elise muttered to herself. Supplies for living, and bedrooms and kitchens and alchemical reagents and libraries. Lucinil and Eleris were stunned.

"It certainly looks like it was built to serve as a refuge....... No one but an Archdemon can enter it......."

If I hadn't lost my memory, this is where I would have come in.

How survival affected Bali in the original is still a thorny issue.

"Enough with the admiration, let's find a spellbook."

"Yes, degradation."

"Nothing too dangerous, but you said it was a grimoire that Cantus Magna would covet, or a trap or conundrum that would be useful in a dungeon?"

"Yes."

"Good."

Lucinil seemed to ponder my terms, and then he and Elise went into the library to look around.

I couldn't stay still, so I started rummaging through the bookshelves in the library.

"Wow....... There's a lot of stuff."

"I see."

Honestly, this wasn't just a few bookshelves. It was more like a library.

I thought it was all magic books, but when I tried to find non-magical books, I found them too. There were also some books on swordsmanship and martial arts.

"Hey, Archdemon."

I could hear Lucinil calling out to me.

"Yes. Why?"

"Why is half the battle."

"Yes, why?"

"Oh, that. Anyway, you said you lost your memory and didn't even know this place existed?"

"Yes."

Through the bookshelves, I could see Rusinil's face, puffed up and worried.

"So if you hadn't lost your memory, you'd be in here?"

"You did, didn't you?"

"Hmmm......."

Rusinil shakes his head.

"Wouldn't the Great Demon King have been spared if he had fled here?"

"I would have thought so, too."

This would have been a place for Valier Junior, not a place for the former Demon King. So instead of fleeing to the Labyrinth, Valier stayed in the Demon Castle to fight Lagan Artorius.

It would make no sense for a monarch to flee when the allied forces are so close to the city of Demon King.

Rusinil nodded, wondering if that logic didn't make sense.

"Well, I guess I didn't do my job here, because you didn't get in after all."

This bunker lost its role when I became a junior in Bali.

And it wasn't until quite a while later that I realized it existed.

Lucinil scanned the bookshelves, pondering, looking at one book after another, putting them back, telekinetically levitating them to her side. Eleris was also looking at the bookshelves with a troubled expression on her face.

Here I found a book on the art of seduction, which I immediately gave to Charlotte, though I thought it might be of use to Lucinil as well.

The library is huge, so I wonder if there's another book on seduction that I didn't find? Well, if this were a real library, there might be a backup book or something, but this isn't a library.

I couldn't find anything that fit my criteria myself, so I was looking to see if there were any other books on seduction that might be helpful to Lucinil.

"Hey, Archdemon."

"Why do you keep calling me that, and why don't you call me Archdemon?"

"Then it's Bali."

"Why?"

Lucinil sees me from across the room, a few books floating in a circle.

"You know what? Magic is blind."

No this?

I was just trying to help.

But he didn't seem to be posting, he seemed genuinely curious.

If you can't tell, I'm telling you to stop wasting your energy and go rest.

I'm kind of curious about what the preserved food here tastes like, but I don't think there's a book for that, and my job is to point the way, not to find it.

I'm trying to do that.



[Introduction to Matchmaking].



A book in an inconspicuous place caught my eye.

I had the same book.

And then I realized why we had the same book.

Same book, different language in the title.

The title is written in a demonic language, not a common language.

A demonic language version of the Book of Engagement.

"Lucinil, have you ever heard of something called the art of engagement?"

"Huh? Engagement?"

I look at Lucinil, clutching a copy of the Demon Language Primer.

"Look at this for now."

Get ready to say thank you, you little old lady.



* * *



Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to thank Rusinil.

It wasn't because Lucinil hadn't read the primer in the demon language.

"I know."

"Is that ......?"

After skimming through the primer, Rusinil said.

"It's true that the arcane arts of dealing with spirits are taboo, but I've been alive for years and I don't know these things?"

Lucinil wanted to have a soul, so he would have studied the magic of souls.

"By no means is this a common spellbook, but unfortunately it is one I know."

Lucinil strokes the surface of the Introduction to Conjuration book.

The magic she already knew would mean that even with the spell, Lucinil would not be able to fulfill her wishes.

"I could fuse my soul with someone else's, but I don't have a soul, and then I would be absorbed, not fused with another being, so I couldn't try."

The very idea of fusing different souls doesn't apply to Lucinil.

After all, magic that deals with souls is useless against soulless beings.

So what is a soul in the first place.

I hadn't thought about it, because I would have it.

Only Lucinil, who did not have it, studied the soul in desperation.

Lucinil looks at me and smiles coyly.

"By the way, you were thinking of me, thank you."

"It's not like that."

"Oh, so you're this guy. Okay. Cute."

What's with the tickling?

By the way, Lucinil is probably the one who has been thinking about souls the most. I found a book on spiritism and thought it might be helpful for Lucinil. .......

The reality is quite the opposite.

If anyone knows the most about soul magic, it's Lucinil. She must have studied magic for a very long time to have it.

So.

The person most likely to have an answer to Charlotte's problem is Lucinil.

"I'd like to ask you something."

"What is it?"

Lucinil shook his head, saying, "Go ahead.

"Say you have a soul that has fused two souls, can you return it to its original state, the state it was in before the fusion?"

Research is already underway on the subject of matchmaking.

But Lucinil had already done all the research. So Lucinil would know everything there is to know about the art of betrothal.

If the situation is urgent, Lucinil might be able to lend a hand to Charlotte. I'll have to think about how to explain this and what approach to take.

But.

"Will it work?"

With those innocent words, all my expectations were shattered.



* * *



Lucinil doesn't know what I was thinking asking that.

But, as if it were a given, I was told that it couldn't be.

"I could mix two glasses of water into one cup and then divide it into two glasses, but that wouldn't make it two glasses of water again, would it?"

"...... Is that a concept?"

"It's actually a little different, but it's not that different."

You can't return something that has already been mixed and unified to its pre-mixed state.

I remembered Charlotte jumping for joy when she received a book on the art of marriage.

But if what Lucinil says is true, her research into the art of seduction won't get Charlotte the results she wants.

If so, what should I do?

If Charlotte's soul became inseparable the moment it joined with the Demon's, will she have to spend the rest of her life like this, waiting to be consumed by the Demon's soul one day?

"Why do you want to know that, anyway?"

Should I say?

That the devil's spirit still resides within the spirit of the princess?

Lucinil might know the answer to what to do, and to tell you the truth, I should at least talk about how I want to do it.

You should be good to go.

If there's no way, it's better to say there's no way.

Now I wanted to be sure of something.

"The Ancestral Demon has fused part of his soul into someone else's."

"......what?"

At my words, Lucinil's mouth dropped open in disbelief. As if she had heard something unbelievable.

"No....... You did that?"

"I'm pretty sure it's circumstantial."

"So if you took a piece of your own soul and planted it in someone, and then....... and they were fine?"

"I don't know about that, but......."

I thought what the Devil did to Charlotte was horrible, but Lucinil seemed to take it quite the opposite way.

The insanity of splitting one's own soul was already a terrible thing to do to oneself.

"Is having your soul divided too much to bear?"

"It's a lot to take in, and it's a good thing I didn't go crazy like a horse. I probably wouldn't have been able to stay sane....... What the hell happened to the Ancestral Demon King that ate you?"

We don't know if Ancestor Valie was crazy. But judging by the way the Demon War rolled, it's unlikely he was driven to madness or lost his taste altogether.

Planting his soul in Charlotte was a huge risk, even for the Devil.

If so, then.

No wonder Izzy was almost lost to the demonic spirit that had taken over Charlotte's body. She didn't recognize me, she just seemed to be going crazy.

The demon somehow managed to maintain his sanity, but the spirit that merged with Charlotte's can't maintain Izzie's?

After hearing my story, Rusinil was stunned.

"That means....... He knew he was going to lose the Demon War....... I'm guessing you've made arrangements to resurrect him somehow. I don't know if that's possible......."

Lucinil seemed to think what the demon was trying to do was too risky.

"You want to resurrect that demon's soul in its entirety?"

I shook my head at Lucinil's question.

"Nope. I'd like to get rid of it."

"......?"

What the hell is this?

Lucinil looked at me with that look.
