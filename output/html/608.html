            Episode 608.





Rowen is not dead.

I faked my death, trying to buy time.

However, all of Rowen's men were killed by paladins sent by Elayon Bolton. It is possible that some of his men survived, but they are few and far between.

If Rowen is up to something, what is she up to, and what can she do about it?

Rowen was gone.

But it can't have left the ecliptic, so it must be somewhere in the ecliptic.

But where is it?

I've made a pact with the Five Great Houses, and the leader of the Crusader Knights is unwilling, but he can't go against the popes, so he has to cooperate with me.

"Password documentation......."

"Yes, I'm working on the decryption now."

The good news is that not all of the records in Rowen's temple were lost.

It could be relevant to our current situation, and it could tell us what Rowen has been up to. For now, Elayon Bolton has recovered the records from the temple's basement and is in the process of deciphering them. Fortunately, it is not impossible to decipher the records of the Inquisitors from within the Templars. It will just take time.

Yeah, that damn time.

"There's no guarantee that nothing will happen until it's done."

Even if it's decipherable, it's still the same amount of text.

Rowen shouldn't act until we've gleaned some meaningful truth from the piles of paperwork, something that tells us what Rowen is capable of.

Do I have that much time? Maybe, maybe not.

It's not out of the realm of possibility that Rowen is not up to something and has simply disappeared.

"It's not like I can't predict what you're going to do."

These were the words of the Pope of the Order of Tuan.

"What are you talking about?"

"Maybe in the past, but these are not the times for killing heretics, especially at the hands of the Church."

"...... Seems like a good kill for something like that."

"......."

"No, I didn't mean to offend you, it's just the way I talk. Tell me what it is."

It makes me cringe to see old people pout when I say something they don't need to.

Clearly, the pope was not wrong. When heresy becomes mainstream, you can catch, torture, and kill a few heretics, but you can't eradicate the whole heresy. There is bound to be carnage.

"It would be nice to be able to eradicate them, but they're impossible to get rid of, because they keep coming back."

"I'm sure you did."

"The inevitable pagans could not be eradicated, nor could they be converted."

"But if they're running heresy inquisitors in the ecliptic, doesn't that mean they're doing something?"

"If we can't stop the heresy, we want to know how big it is, if there's a core, who it is, where it is, how far it goes, things like that."

It was clear to Elion Bolton that this was the first time he had ever heard of such a thing.

It was clear that he had not been thoroughly informed of the inner workings of the ecliptic until now.

I thought I knew what the Pope of the Tuan Order meant.

Once upon a time, Bertus said.

Organized crime is inevitable.

A negative demand must be met, a supply arises to meet it, and the supply is inevitably organized.

If tackling organized crime only leads to the creation of other gangs, he said, it's better to take control.

At the time, Bertus asked me if I would ever consider becoming a Thieves' Guild Master.

This is the same as this.

The fundamental reason for heresy is distrust of the Church of God. Unless that distrust is resolved, hunting down and killing the heretics that arise is not the solution. Other heresies will inevitably arise.

The choice of the popes, therefore, was not the eradication or elimination of heresy.

Understanding their size and scope.

The emphasis is on learning more about the heretical forces themselves. Even if we can't eliminate them, it would be helpful to have a clearer idea of their whereabouts.

Too many pagans.

So instead of eradicating them, they took a different approach.

By owning a criminal organization, Bertus sought to gain control over the crime itself.

I wonder if the popes thought differently.

"Rowen was in control of the pagan faction, and key figures among them."

You don't have to win the hearts and minds of all the pagans. If you could control the leaders of each pagan faction, you had it all.

Elayon Bolton looks at the Pope of the Order of Tuan.

"Are you saying that ...... is actually behind the heresies and martial arts?"

"I guess you could look at it that way."

Times are messy, and inquisitors don't work like they used to.

The Church of the Lord was not judging heresy, it was taking it into its own hands. The popes were making those decisions, and Rowen was in charge.

The Cult of the Lord was behind the cult, and Rowen was the field director, so to speak.

But she was pursuing a dangerous endeavor, and was purged for refusing the orders of the Crusaders.

Indeed, Rowen would despise the warrior religion as well as the demonic faith.

However, due to the inevitability of pagan outbreaks, the task of identifying zodiacal pagan forces and bringing their leaders to heel has been a long time coming.

In this day and age, the true pagan masters are not the ones who deceive people by establishing an all-inclusive faith.

"This all sounds a bit like saying that Rowen is the owner of all heresies, doesn't it, and while he's not technically a lord, he's kind of like a lord or something?"

If you can control all the pagans, isn't that effectively being a priest?

Elayon Bolton believes he must kill Rowen for uncovering a truth that could put him on a collision course with the Empire.

However, I was completely unaware of the dangers of Rowen itself.

The popes were wary of giving him too much information in order to keep Elion Bolton in check.

Petty power struggles. And fear of each other.

The consequences were catastrophic.

The world was so strange that the Inquisitor, who was supposed to put down and edify heretics, was actually the master of heresy.

And what will Rowen do now that he has been abandoned by the Church of the Lord to whom he swore allegiance.

Rowen will be in a refugee camp.

They're going to use the pagans to do something.

That night.

Three sophomores from Class B, Louis, Christina, and Anna, were back in the dorms after a long absence.

It wasn't just to take a long break.

Because what he couldn't do for Ludwig, he could do for Ludwig now that he knew the truth.

Lost arm.

You can revert it.

"It's easier said than done."

But unlike the other two, for whom giving the arm back was a basic procedure, Christina brought Ludwig in and immediately delivered a negative outlook.

Christina was speaking privately with the Emperor at the time, so Anna and Louis were later told what Ludwig had said. This is also why she returned to the Burinake dormitory.

"I've heard it's painful, I've heard about rejection, but it's okay, I can live with that."

You will regain your lost arm and be able to fight.

Ludwig wished he could do something about it.

Issues like rejection and pain had already been fully explained by Anna and Louis.

However, if she were to undergo the Chimera procedure, she would have to do it herself.

"Ludwig. It's not about that."

"Not......?"

"Sure, it can be easy in some cases, if it's something you just have to put up with....... The side effects, the rejection. If you just have to put up with the pain, it can be done."

Shouldn't that work?

As if she knows what he's thinking, Christina looks at Ludwig and says, "You're right.

"They're not going to put a rabbit's or a deer's or a cow's leg on you. What you saw was a rabbit. It's not a person, it's a rabbit. It's a procedure where they cut off the leg of a live rabbit, cut off the leg of another rabbit, and then glue it on."

"......Yes."

"When I say I'm going to give you a chimeric right arm, I mean I'm going to cut off someone else's arm and reattach it. Ludwig, are you okay with that?"

"......!"

Ludwig's eyes widened at that.

It's not a simple matter.

Body parts are not created.

A chimeric procedure makes something that doesn't belong together. Inevitably, then, Ludwig's new arm must be someone else's.

That's what she says to Ludwig.

If you're cutting off someone's arm and gluing it back on, it's easy.

"Of course you don't want that, but the lab has a lot of unsuccessful reconstructions, as you've seen. It's not perfect, so you'll inevitably get an arm from one of the restored bodies that didn't come back to life. A cadaver arm."

"So....... works......."

Your new arm is obviously someone else's, not your own.

You can't use a living person's arm, and what remains in the lab is the arm of a cadaver that failed to be restored.

"It's covered in black magic and sobriety and enhancements. It's not a normal arm. It looks like a human arm, but it's not a human arm."

Something else that looks like a human arm, but has already ceased to be a human arm.

"Didn't you think the bodies being restored were overly intact?"

"Uh......?"

"Most of them are war dead, people who died in combat. If you're killed in combat,....... they're going to have their limbs cut off, or they're going to be crushed."

Only then did Ludwig realize that he hadn't thought at all about the integrity of the bodies in the port being restored.

There were no severed limbs, and everything was being cleaned up.

"If they could use that technology on people in the first place, they would have told you that they could regenerate your arm, not transplant another one."

If you can regenerate a corpse, why can't you regenerate a living person?

I should have asked that question first.

"A living person wouldn't even make it through the process, which is why this magic is so....... that's why it can't be used on living people."

Christina's expression was one of pain.

If playback is possible, play it and do not transplant.

Regeneration is not something you can use on the living in the first place.

And reanimated things are not something you can attach to the living.

"Ludwig, if you ask me, I might be able to give you another arm that doesn't belong to a corpse. Do you want it?"

"No....... No, I don't want that."

Ludwig could never do something as crazy as chopping off a man's arm and reattaching it.

"Ludwig, I'm not really going to say no, but the point is, I don't know what the consequences of such a procedure would be, and I don't want to do it."

After she finishes, Christina looks at Anna and Louis.

Clearly, they weren't lying. If you undergo the Chimera procedure, you can get your missing arm back.

As long as it's a living human arm.

I mentioned the chimera procedure because I thought Ludwig might be acting strangely.

They weren't oblivious to the risks.

However, he was referring to the chimera procedure because he thought Ludwig might try to take his own life.

But who knows if the recipient will be able to tolerate it.

Transplanting magical byproducts of the dead into the living.

Ludwig could only stare at him with a stony expression, a look of hope given and then taken away.

Seeing that look, Christina bites her lip.

"Ludwig, if you really want to do that....... but if you die....... I will never, ever bring you back."

If you die during a procedure, you might be tempted to fight as a resurrected corpse afterward.

Therefore, Christina firmly nailed that, unlike Ashar, you should not try to undergo the procedure with the intention of dying.

"Okay....... Okay."

Louis and Anna could only shake their heads in disbelief as Ludwig looked on in dismay.
