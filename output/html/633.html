            Episode 633.





As the Archduke says, I'm a strange creature if I'm not vengeful.

There are many who hate me, saying that the devil caused it all.

But hate is hate, and some say that's what you get for being a demon prince whose world was destroyed by humanity in the first place.

The right to destroy humanity.

If not me, then who the hell has it.

Rather, it's weird if you don't want it.

That's why people assume that my perfectly good motives make it natural for me to wish for the destruction of the human race.

But I was surprised.

The Archduke was ready to die.

"I was going to say, you can kill me, but spare my daughter."

The archduke's stern expression wasn't because he was angry at his daughter's thief.

I was ready to die.

The Archduke is my enemy.

He deserves to be killed, and he has his precious daughter with him.

So, if I'm asked to give my life, I'm going to give it.

And now that he knows that the Demon War was an unjust war, he even feels guilty about it.

"If I do something like that, you're going to jump forward ....... No, how do you see his face?"

"I see."

The Archduke nodded with a faint smile.

It's a weird situation.

He was probably thinking about a problem I hadn't thought about at all.

Herriot followed me.

The Archduke must have kept thinking. Am I using Heriot, or do I really value him?

If you value her, do you value her even though she is the daughter of your enemy.

What to think about that enemy.

You've probably been thinking about it for a while.

So the request for a rendezvous made the Archduke think that it was finally coming.

He thought he might have to make a terrible choice, one that would guarantee his daughter's safety in exchange for his neck.

But when I got there, I was fidgeting and looking at her with the look of a daughter thief.

Right.

From an archduke's point of view, I was ready to die.

Because the guy who deserved to kill me is looking like he deserved to die.

That must have been a weird feeling.

Soon.

The silence for over an hour was due to neither the Archduke nor I having anything to say to each other.

Because all they have is guilt.

So the Archduke is stunned when he realizes that I'm not vindictive and narcissistic and all that in the first place.

"Strange, you don't even seem to realize you're a demon."

Yes.

There should be at least some sort of vengeance, and it's odd that there isn't, even from the point of view of the devil being good.

"Actually, it's not much different than that - I have no memories of my time as the Prince of the Demon Realm, and I was born anew the day the Demon War ended."

"Or that you know the future."

"It's kind of irrelevant now."

I don't need to tell you that I'm the creator.

They won't believe it.

"Yeah......."

The Archduke slumped down on the bench, refusing to understand what he couldn't understand.

I wonder if I'm feeling a decade older.

Honestly, I didn't come to this meeting with a light heart either, but the Grand Duke chose to meet me with a heart far heavier than mine.

More than I can imagine, the leaders of humanity should fear me.

I realized that while I was afraid, I was also acknowledging the legitimacy of my vengeance.

I realized that the very act of trying to include them, rather than exterminate them, could be seen as forgiveness in a sense by the leaders.

If this is good news, it's good news.

Revenge was not in the realm of my imagination, so it was not even on my mind. Rather, it was those who feared the devil, not me, who were justifying, signifying, and rationalizing the logic of my actions.

I can do that.

He who has the right to destroy mankind, seeks to forgive and dominate it.

Some will shudder at its oppression, while others will be grateful for its mercy and favor.

Like the attitude the Archduke has now.

"......I think I know what you want."

The Archduke now knows what I'm trying to say without me having to say it.

"Do you need my power."

Archduke's Lore.

Archduke Power.

And the Archduke's territory.

There, the people.

"Yes."

In other words, everything in the Duchy of Saint-Thuan.

"Yeah......."

The Archduke nods.

"If that can be even the smallest reparation for all I have done to you, for all I have done to the demons, then I will."

"People are going to start pointing fingers."

"None of that has anything to do with it."

The Archduke smiles faintly.

"There are laws of existence, and we just follow them."

The Archduke, thought to be a sinless man, has become a sinful man.

"I thought I had upheld that moral, but it turns out that all of that was just hubris."

Even if you always thought you were on the right path, even if you thought you were on the right path, at some point you look back and realize you were on the wrong path.

The Archduke finally admits his arrogance.

"If that's the case, I'll do what I can now."

Recognize that you have been overconfident in your ability to judge the good path.

"My power, from now on, is yours."

No one can be right all the time.

Like everyone does.

The Archduke was such a person.



* * *



The Duchy of St. Thuan has decided to side with me.

It wasn't at all what I thought it would be.

I was worried about what would happen if the Archduke tried to kill me.

The Archduke thought he had to cooperate with me because of the sins he had committed.

The process wasn't what I had envisioned, but I got the results I wanted.

"It would be nice to have a meal, but you're not ready."

"Ah....... Yes."

You're probably referring to other preparations, not meal prep.

Did the Archduke tell the Archduchess that he was prepared to die?

Told or untold, if you met the Archduchess now, she might have a heart attack.

I know she's safe, I've seen her with my own eyes, but I'm sure she's as afraid of me as the Archduke is.

"I'll explain it well. If you come back later, I'll be able to beat you like I used to."

The Archduke will only be able to see her after he explains things to her first.

Just like old times.

I can't help but feel nostalgic for the way the Archduchess and Harriet's brothers treated me when I first came to Arnaria.

It was incredibly overwhelming at the time.

I wonder if things will ever go back to the way they were.

For some reason, the Archduke's words struck a chord.

You can go back to the way things were.

Yes, you should be able to do that.

Even if you can't do anything about the things that have become irreversible.

Things that can be reversed, obviously, can be reversed.

"You would have had something of your own, by the way. Was there ever a place on earth for that?"

"There is. It's not huge, but it's there......."

The Archduke nodded slowly, wondering if there was still a safe place to plant a flag in this murderous land.

Anti-aircraft should be fine.

No more.

Or maybe it wasn't anyone else in the first place.

"I suppose you could stop by if you'd like."

The Archduke's eyes widened at that.

"......really?"

Probably.

It's clear that she's excited to see with her own eyes where her daughter has been all this time.

I'm the king.

If I want to do it, I'll do it. What?

But then I remembered something the Duchess had said not long ago.

You don't know if it's a wolf or a sheep, you don't know if it's a wolf or a sheep, so what do you do when it gets in the fence?

The Archduke is not just anyone.

However, what many people learn about Edina is the danger.

For now, even Rowen has never been to Edina.

"That....... Well, I'm sorry to break it to you, but I think....... I shouldn't have to make that decision alone."

It's kind of crappy to build up expectations and then let them down, but I guess it's not up to me to decide.

"Well, at least now that we're here, Harriet might come here occasionally and....... I mean, it's not impossible......."

"Yeah, I see what you're saying, and when you look at it that way, it's probably better that I don't know, I get it."

The Archduke nodded, as if to say, "Don't feel bad," as if he knew what I was looking out for.

And I think I'm already happy that I'm not the only one who decides what happens in my world.

Oh no.

This is what makes her go.

Right.

In the midst of the heavy, serious atmosphere, I was reminded of something I had barely remembered.

Adelia.

Adelia's problem sticks in my head and won't go away.

"I told you ...... was fine, no need to apologize."

"No....... Uh, no, that's not it, thanks for understanding."

The Archduke had a different misconception.

What the hell.

I always knew that the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan was an idiot, but I also knew that he was actually a proper nobleman and a good man.

I wasn't going to say anything.

I can't stand it.

Does the Archduke really not know?

Let's get a little lucky, shall we?

"Titans, by the way."

The Archduke crossed his arms at my words.

"I can fully cooperate with whatever you do in the future, but I cannot give you the power of a Titan."

No, I didn't mean that.

But we have to talk about running Titan anyway.

"The Titan is a magical weapon that must be operated by me and Adelia, your classmate, as you know. It is impossible for me to operate the Titan alone, as it requires two devices called Master Orbs."

I'm aware of that.

But naturally, Adelia's story became a hot topic.

"And if you're thinking of using the Titan for war......."

It's clear that he's thinking about causing a lot of damage. Of course, the Archduke has no say in the matter if I want that, but in the end, I doubt the Archduke wants mass bloodshed.

"No, no, no, why would I write that?"

"Oh...... I guess."

"It's bad enough that it's not used in critical situations."

"Yeah. If you really need to use the Titan, you'll be dragging him into something dangerous too....... And frankly, I don't want that."

Yes.

If you have an Archduke and Adelia, you can run the Titan.

It's more of a failsafe, but it's also one of the weaknesses of the Titan, because with just the two of them, they can run the Titan without anyone else's permission.

Adelia may be a genius, but she's still a kid in the grand duke's eyes.

The last thing you want to do is get dragged into the Darklands' and the Empire's supremacy battles.

Anyway.

It's not so much that it's awkward as it is that Adelia's name has come up.

"Titans aside, that....... Speaking of which, that....... you know, Adelia."

"Oh, right."

"What's he doing....... doing?"

Carefully.

Don't look suspicious.

Let's hear what the Archduke is thinking.

If you don't know, I'm not going to tell you.

We're just making sure the Archduke doesn't really know.

In response to my question, the Grand Duke hummed....... and sighed.

"Yes, you said Adelia was very close to our youngest......."

I'm guessing you think I'm asking this at Herriot's behest.

This is good news.

"You can't say you're doing well by following a war zone."

It was a little weird to ask how you're doing.

"Well, aside from getting along, I guess you could say I'm safe."

I don't want to know if it's safe or not, I want to know what the Archduke thinks of Adelia.

What to do?

"The Archduke says that Adelia is....... What kind of child do you think she is?"

I don't know!

Let's just ask.

"Once, I remembered something you said."

"......me?"

"Didn't you say you were going to build something that would amaze the world in your own little magical society?"

a.

That's what we were talking about.

"I realized that my vision was much narrower than yours."

Eventually, Moonshine and the Power Cartridge were created.

I predicted it, not the wizard.

"Was that an object that belonged to a future you knew?"

"It's ......."

"It's funny, someone who knows this is going to happen in the future tells you the future, and no one believes them at the time....... No, that's what the future is supposed to be."

Who would believe me if I told you that crazy things happen?

"There are some people who make miracles happen. Adelia, I think, is one of those people."

People whose very existence is a miracle and a blessing to humanity.

That's probably the highest praise an archduke can give.

But....... Not that.......

No, I should really say.

It's really, really hard to pretend this isn't the case.

Does she look like a woman?

You can't say that!

"I was thinking, if it's okay with him, what if we asked him to become a member of our family when all is said and done....... I've been thinking about that."

"Is that ......?"

Me.......

Excuse me?

No?

"He was good friends with our youngest, and that's a good thing."

No, I don't think so.

No?

"Apparently, the third seems to like her quite a bit."

I want to die.



* * *



After somehow exchanging the remaining words with the Archduke, I sobbed my way out into the square.

Honestly, I don't remember much of what happened after that.

"Your Highness......?"

In the distance, a hooded figure came running up, startled.

"I didn't think anything was going on, but......."

No......

Nothing happened to me.......

"Mom......."

"......, huh?"

"Mom I'm dying......."

"I, Your Highness......?"

Mom!

Mother!

She's not my mom, but she's my great-great-great-grandmother or something!

Yay!

I'd rather be a toddler and forget about this whole thing.

Eleris looked dumbfounded as she hugged me, realizing that I had suddenly become a damsel in distress.

"Zee, calm down. I don't know what's going on, but......."

Elise pats me on the back.

Dizzy.

I'm already dizzy.

I've heard more dizzying things.

"Curiosity is....... Curiosity kills people, not cats......."

"......Yes?"

I told myself not to talk about it when I went in!

Why go in there and ask me stupid questions!

Uh!

I'm an asshole.

Uh.
