            Episode 694.





It's been a while since I've slept in my bed.

It's been a while since I've been able to go to sleep without worrying about being attacked, and with all my nerves relaxed.

When Ellen woke up, she was startled by the feel of the pillow against her face.

The otherness that has been created by the life we've lived is actually a fear of comfort.

-Second!

Birdsong from the jungle beyond my window and the sound of waves in the distance tell me that yesterday's events were not a dream.

"ah......."

Somehow, since yesterday, everything seems unreal.

Everything from my reunion with the black cat to this morning feels like a little freaky lie.

In fact, it's probably more like a dream you have when you're falling asleep in front of a campfire, unable to overcome your fatigue.

Or a zoomorphic light on the brink of death.

But no matter how hard I try to stay awake, I can't help but realize that it's real.

Normally, as soon as I wake up, I'm in a hurry to get organized and hit the road.

Walking, sometimes running.

Kill the monster.

Chewing on a tree root.

You can't even lie down, just nap in the rough outdoors.

It's so unfamiliar to wake up in a nice, fluffy bed after a long, dull day like that.

Strange.

"ugh......."

Ellen stayed in her pajamas and hugged the covers for quite a while.

I felt like an idiot, but I couldn't get up.



* * *



Ellen took a shower, newly grateful for the ubiquity of water.

After changing into my prepared white cotton dress, I sat in silence for a moment.

-curl

Hungry.

I was always hungry.

In all honesty, I wasn't thrilled with what I ate yesterday.

For years, I felt a hunger carved into my bones that no amount of eating would ever satisfy.

Ellen heads to the kitchen.

The pantry was stocked with ingredients, the cookware was in place, and the kitchen had all the systems in place.

They didn't have the luxury of cooking in the field.

But I learned a lot standing on Reinhardt's shoulders at Temple.

Once you know the basics, the application is not difficult.

As long as I had the ingredients, I could cook whenever I wanted.

For the first time in a very long time, Ellen ate with a knife instead of a fork.

But we didn't build anything spectacular.

I was going to make the meat stew I loved so much.

It's not a big deal, but I plan to make a lot of them.

I'm going to break the ice with the forced news.

So Wangchang.

Eat, eat, eat, and make so many that you can't finish them.

I thought, I'll eat it up.

Ellen pulls out a giant pot from the kitchen and begins to prepare.

It doesn't have to be good.

Anyway, with my dulled palate, everything I eat tastes amazing. I could still smell and taste the lobster I ate yesterday on the tip of my tongue.

Just like that.

Ellen began to eat nearly a pot's worth of meat stew.

There's no one to judge you for looking like you ate yesterday.

What it feels like to lose control.

I ate for almost two hours.

I was so caught up in eating that I realized.

-delay

"!!!!"

The door to the mansion burst open, and Reinhard entered.

And unfortunately, Reinhardt had a direct view of the kitchen from the doorway.

Ellen scarfing down stew by the crockpot, not even setting the table properly.

Ellen realized that the white dress she was wearing was a little stained with splashes of stew.

Reinhardt sees it too.

"......."

"......."

There's a moment of silence.

And Ellen realizes that Reinhardt is not empty-handed.

I thought it might be something like a chorus.

Judging by its size, it's clear that Ellen has prepared quite a bit for the amount of food she's going to eat.

Apparently, Ellen has brought a meal to eat.

I couldn't resist, so I made a big pot of stew and ate it all.

I've made a bunch of them, and I'm getting hungry.

"Hah......."

Reinhardt sighs.

It was probably a sigh of frustration, not pathetic.

How much you've been starving.

I'm sure it was a sigh of frustration.

The sigh stabs me in the chest so deeply that it's deadly.

"......."

I knew I would cry when I met him.

I'm afraid of Reinhardt.

Sorry.

I felt like I was going to cry.

However, I was wondering why I kept getting embarrassed and crying.

Ellen cried again.



* * *



The next level of food is in place.

On the first night of the diet, Reinhardt dumped a bunch of food in front of Ellen, who sat looking like she'd been caught rummaging through the kitchen.

"......I guess I was a little harsh yesterday."

"Huh?"

I don't know what you're talking about.

"I said wash, not scrub?"

"Ah, ah, ah......."

In fact, Ellen's white skin was still flushed from washing so heavily yesterday.

This is bad enough where you can see it, it's probably worse where you can't.

Even when I felt like I was going to collapse and die from exhaustion, I still managed to get all my fingernails and toenails cleaned up.

I wasn't really preparing anything.

But something tells me you're determined.

I thought I was being ridiculous, but I did it anyway.

Ellen made no reply, but bowed her head, her face widening with another meaning.

Reinhardt smiles wryly as he imagines Ellen washing her gourd, crying with sorrow, after being told she looked like a dog rolling in the gutter.

"What do you think, do they have noodles?"

"ugh....... ....... ìœ¼......."

"Sorry, no. Hey, I won't. Uh, I won't. I'm not doing it!"

"......."

Reinhardt shook his head as he looked at Ellen, who was on the verge of another seizure of grief.

I'm pretty sure that's not what you're talking about.

It keeps trying to tease me with totally weird sounds.

It's lightweight, and it talks about nothing.

It's obviously done on purpose.

Now, I'm not mad at those words.

I feel so happy, sorry, and guilty.

I feel like everything can go back to the way it was.

I think I'm the only one who needs to be convinced.

I think I'm the only one who needs to accept it.

I just can't do it.

I feel sad and sorry for myself.

Ellen doesn't say anything, but Reinhardt smiles bitterly and rises from his seat, as if his expression alone can tell what he's thinking.

"Eat, I'm coming."

"......."

Reinhardt walked out of the mansion, taking care to make Ellen miserable again.

You can't not eat it.

Ellen ate the prepared meal.

Every last one of them.

Needless to say, it was delicious, regardless of how I felt.



* * *



And so life went on.

Reinhardt didn't come every day; he'd skip a day, and he didn't stay all the time.

Often it was just a quick face-to-face.

I didn't always say much.

I didn't get any closer than necessary.

It was just a little bit of distance.

It was Ellen who was impatient.

I wish I could have said something.

Are you going to keep him locked up like this, or am I going to have to accept his life?

But my jaw dropped.

I felt too guilty to ask.

It was hard enough to keep my mouth shut and meet his gaze, but it was impossible to ask him anything.

It was only a few days of sleeping and eating without cravings.

I stayed up all night.

I shouldn't have to live like this.

I shouldn't be doing this.

Even a little.

To pay for what I've done, to pay for what I've done to the world.

We shouldn't be stuck here.

The compulsion was overwhelming.

Kicking myself.

It was just another day of suffering to suffer.

You'd think that would lead to complacency, but it didn't.

The self-pity only became more persistent.

The more comfortable you are.

The calmer the better.

It gets worse.

I felt like my body was getting easier, but my mind was getting more and more worn down.

About a month after that.

Whether Ellen was impatient or anxious, time passed.

It was enough to wash away years of fatigue, not to mention mental issues.

I was always resilient and fit.

Whatever it was, it ate and slept well.

One of those days, still sunny.

"Come out."

Reinhardt called Ellen outside.



* * *



Dressed in a white dress and sandals, Ellen followed Reinhardt to the waterfront.

"Now, slowly, you're back to your old self, aren't you?"

"Huh? Ah....... Ah. Uhhh......."

"Okay, let's do this for real."

-grunt

In Reinhardt's right hand, this time not a branch, but a sword.

Ellen's eyes widen.

Sword of the War God.

Alsbringer.

It fell into Reinhardt's hands.

"Do you think I would have fed and housed you all this time just to raise a cheap pig that wouldn't get fat no matter how much I ate?"

At the outburst, Ellen nods with a wistful expression.

"......No."

So far, I hadn't said anything, so maybe it was just an extension of the first day.

They saw that Ellen had reached a mental and physical breaking point, and they left her alone until she was back on track.

Boom.

There were days when she was overwhelmed with thoughts, but in the end, it was enough to get her back on track.

"Ramen, do you have it?"

Do you have it.

Why do you ask?

Did it disappear?

Ellen nods in response to Reinhardt's strange question.

"Then take it out."

Like the first day, Reinhardt says sternly, "I won't allow any branches.

What happens if you say no?

Ellen says softly, clutching the hem of her dress in protest.

"I...... skirt....... and I'm wearing......."

"What the hell."

"......."

Ellen could only cringe in the face of Reinhardt, who said, "That's your business and none of my business.

"I've got five wives now, why would I care about your underwear?"

"......."

"Shut up and eat your lentils."

At the sadly abrasive words, Ellen clears her throat.

Yes.

There is no such thing as a right to plead.

There are things you can't do, but what you can do, you'll want to do.

On the first day, I was emotionally, mentally, and physically overwhelmed.

So I was literally beaten until I passed out.

The tip of my sword wavered, and so did my mind.

But it's now been three days.

It's still overwhelming, but I've somehow gotten used to seeing Reinhardt's face again after five years.

My health is back.

I was so well-rested, I felt refreshed, as if the grime had been shed from my body and mind.

I can't even remember the last time I was this prepared.

I was well rested.

I took a long break.

Well done.

I didn't say more than necessary, not because I cared about Ellen, but because I didn't have anything to say.

I wasn't going to say anything until Ellen was back on track.

Ellen still doesn't know what to do. She doesn't know if she deserves to be forgiven, if she deserves this life.

I don't think this is the case, but there are things you can do.

Reinhardt wants to check something, and Ellen is now fully functional, just as Reinhardt wanted.

Then, you can show it to them.

What Reinhardt wants to see.

That's pretty obvious, isn't it?

The confusion and hesitation finally eased a bit.

Ellen's face is finally calm, as she's been shaking with fear, crying with grief, and struggling with guilt the entire time she's been stuck on the desert island.

Ellen carefully removes her sandals.

With your sandals neatly tucked aside, you step into the white, bare sand.

Reinhard stared at Ellen as she did so.

After taking a deep breath, Ellen looks at Reinhardt.

A calm expression.

Serene eyes.

Reinhardt returns with the same expression and look in his eyes that he's always had.

"So, you want to beat me?"

Ellen asks, and Reinhardt nods.

"Isn't that obvious?"

On the first day, Ellen was so weakened that she wasn't worth dealing with.

Reinhardt wants to check.

How much stronger.

Compared to Ellen, now what.

He tries to prove it by fighting Ellen, who is at full strength.

Have you surpassed your teacher?

If so, deal with it.

Ellen gives a faint smile.

There will be anger, frustration, and resentment.

But I knew it was going to come at me with full force, so I watched it until it was full force. It waited without showing any emotion.

So, save the next one for another day.

You just have to give it your all.

-Snarl

In Ellen's right hand, she holds the moon sword, Ramen.

Ellen couldn't help but notice that something had changed in her holy object.

The Voidblade Ramen, always black as if it had been projecting the night sky for some time, returned as a silver, cold blade.

"ah......."

Voidblade is no longer Voidblade.

Ellen knows that Ramen reacts to sadness.

Just by being in the same place as Reinhardt, Rament loses the form of the Voidblade.

Grief is so easy to lose.

Just by being together, they disappear.

Now, I'm not sad.

"What's wrong with my holy relics. Isn't it cool?"

Reinhardt smirks as if he knows it.

"And Rafelt?"

Reinhardt asks about not summoning Cloak of the Sun.

Ellen smiles brightly.

Full.

"...... Is that all you need?"

And provocation.

"And if you summoned him later, how embarrassing do you think that would be?"

"That was then."

Reinhardt keeps his Alsbringer pointed at Ellen and slowly measures the distance between them.

There were always days like this.

It was always one of those days.

I don't know if this is allowed, but

We've decided to go all in for now, so we're not waiting for it to come to us.

So, we go first.

-pot!

The hem of her dress flutters wildly, and Ellen stabs the ramen into Reinhardt's chest, eyes wide.

Reinhardt smiles, seeing those veiled eyes and the trajectory of the sword.

It was a smile and a look in his eyes that said he wanted this.

-cardeddup!

Lament and Alsbringer clash, creating a storm of magic and blowing the sand of the white sandy beach into a frenzy.

Bottom to top.

"I don't know about anything else, but......."

Ellen sheathes her sword and glares at Reinhardt.

"You're getting pretty cocky, Reinhardt."

Ellen Artorius.

A warrior, long thought to be dead and gone, parries the demon's sword, muttering coldly.

I did you wrong.

I betrayed you.

You said I ran away from you.

If you beat me, it's in a completely unrelated area.

You wanted the whole me, so I'll show you the whole me.

No, you can still make a concession or two.

Ellen Artorius speaks with her eyes.

With a sword thrust upward from the bottom, the Demon says, stamping down with force.

"Well, that's good enough, isn't it?"

Reinhard pushes Ellen's sword away from him and smirks.

-Currrrrr!

A storm of magic erupted, and the two bounced off each other as roughly as they had fought.

In both cases, I landed properly and didn't end up on the white sand.

Ellen grabs her ramen and runs wildly.

Reinhardt rushes forward as well.

The hem of the warrior's white dress and the demon's shirt flapped wildly in the wind.
