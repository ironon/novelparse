No more words were exchanged.

Both Ellen and Harriet retired to their respective bedrooms to sleep without a word, leaving me sitting on the terrace, staring idly at the lapping shore.

I made this choice because if I didn't, I would lose Charlotte.

Therefore, I have lost something else. I can't explain exactly what I lost, but I lost something and I will lose something.

This is not the end of the story.

I must be a hero.

Only when it is known that I am the master of Alsbringer, and I have gained public fame, will I have political standing as a princess betrothed to such a hero.

Inclusion in the Warrior's Yellow House.

Bertus wanted it. I'm not sure exactly what Bertus' intentions were in reigniting a fight that was already over. Was it really just for fun, or was there some other ulterior motive.

However, I have to be the hero.

To be a hero, you have to do something, not just be known as the master of Alsbringer.

You have to do a lot of things that are obviously dangerous.

On a beautiful beach, with the sound of waves and grasshoppers mingling, I spent the night unable to fall asleep.



* * *



The engagement of the beggar Reinhardt to the princess Charlotte de Gradias would have been laughable a year ago.

But now it was funny in a different way.

An empress who is losing her political standing.

The master of Alsbringer, the most powerful symbol of the post-Magma War holy artifacts.

The successor to Lagan Artorius, so to speak.

The betrothal had now become a nonsense, as the descendant of a warrior should marry a mere princess.

The three left for the Kamsencha Archipelago and returned the next day. Conversation was scarce. Ellen was speechless, Reinhard could not speak, and Herriot was silent, knowing that he wanted to say something, but that no words could answer.

I wasn't in any condition to train.

Reinhardt locked himself in his room, while Ellen wandered around the dorm in a daze.

In the main lobby on the second floor, Ellen could see Charlotte de Gradias returning to the temple from the palace.

Naturally, Ellen and Charlotte's eyes met.

"Uh, ah....... How are you?"

Charlotte can say hello to Ellen because, despite their different classes, they've crossed paths and are by no means strangers.

It can happen.

But even as you raise your hand to say hello, your fingertips tremble slightly.

Wiggly eyes.

That gives Ellen some kind of signal.

Charlotte seemed to feel guilty just looking at her. It had been that way the last few times they'd crossed paths.

Ellen didn't remember much up until that point.

But only because I now know the implications of Charlotte's behavior.

Reinhardt had been acting a little strange lately, the tip of his sword wobbling, and he seemed uneasy.

That it wasn't the devil, it was this problem, and that I didn't know how to explain it to myself.

Now you just know.

When Ellen does not return the greeting, she moves toward Charlotte, who vaguely glances at her. As Ellen approaches, Charlotte takes a half step back, looking slightly frightened.

Ellen is also a commoner, after all, but she is the wielder of the Lament and the sister of Lagan Artorius.

From the time she entered Temple, Ellen was a person whose status, if not her identity, was second to none.

It's just that Ellen never once tried to take advantage of it.

That's why Ellen has never been intimidated by anyone.

Ellen looks the Empress in the eye.

"Tell me one."

"Huh? Uh....... Uh-huh."

Ellen asks, looking at the Empress with a slight bite to her lip.

"Reinhard, do you like it?"

"......."

Charlotte's eyes widened, as if she hadn't expected him to ask her so bluntly. She could have walked away, embarrassed and wondering why he would ask such a question.

But the look on Ellen's face when she asked me that was like she was going to slap me if I ran away.

Charlotte must have intuited what Ellen knew because of her question.

Engagement.

Knowing what I know about the matter, I'm frustrated, but I know I can't change Reinhardt's mind, so that's all I can ask Charlotte.

Charlotte looked into Ellen's eyes as she did so.

"Yes."

Say what you mean when you feel like crap.

"A lot....... a lot....... a lot."

Ellen could see it in Charlotte's eyes. At least Reinhardt wasn't being used by Charlotte. If Charlotte was just using Reinhardt to stay alive, Ellen didn't know what she would do.

But Charlotte is sincere. We don't know when it started, but Charlotte leans heavily on Reinhardt, and even in this situation, she likes him enough to feel sorry for him, rather than happy for him.

One last bit of anticipation.

Because it broke.

Ellen is dumbfounded.

"I......."

After mumbling something incoherent, Ellen stopped.

Me first.

More from me.

I.

Much more time.

"......."

The more she said, the more miserable she felt, but Ellen couldn't bring herself to say it.

In front of Charlotte de Gradias, whose face contorts in guilt at the mere sight of herself.

I liked him before you did. I was with Reinhard when everyone thought he was a lowly beggar, and I was with him, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.

In this situation, Reinhardt has to choose you because his life is in danger.

This is so unfair.

Ellen couldn't say that.

"Sorry......."

In the face of Charlotte's shattered expression, Ellen averts her gaze.

"......."

It was painful to see Charlotte so unhappy with a subject that had what she wanted most.



* * *



In the dorms, Ellen and Harriet would pass me by without a word.

Herriot didn't know what to say, and Ellen simply walked past with her head down.

Rather than disliking me, it seemed to be a slightly different issue.

Now I don't know what to do with it, so I'm avoiding it.

The funny thing is. Just as Ellen and Harriet found it difficult to deal with me, so did Charlotte. When Charlotte saw me, she hesitated, as if she didn't know what to say, and ended up saying nothing.

I wonder if they feel weird saying thank you or sorry.

However, no matter what I said, I was supposed to take my major classes with Ellen.

I had a similar feeling to the first time I saw Ellen in first grade.

In front of me was Ellen Artorius, a cold, emotionless woman who seemed unwilling to feel anything for me.

The tip of the sword was not emotional, but rather restrained.

It was a dry lesson where he just beat me in the exact right way at the exact right time.

Ellen never said a word to me about anything personal, which is why our lessons lasted all day.

"That's it for today. Go back and get some rest."

After class, Saviolin Tana said. Ellen left without a word.

"Reinhardt, you stay behind."

"Yes."

I thought I knew why she'd called me. In the waiting room of the senior combat training center, with Ellen gone and me alone, she sat down next to me and put her arm around me.

"I have heard that you are engaged to be married to the Empress."

"Yes."

"......."

She looked toward the exit of the waiting room, a complicated expression on her face.

"Your Majesty has had many thoughts on this matter. Whether or not to publicly announce your presence."

Making my presence public would ensure Charlotte's safety, but it could also put me in danger. The Emperor was therefore treading carefully in this matter.

"The imperial court will take no position. But in aristocratic circles, word will spread."

"I see."

"Yeah, because that's the only safe thing to do."

It's not Bertus, but Charlotte's supporters who are in trouble, and to stop them, rumors are spreading through the imperial and aristocratic circles.

The next heir to Alsbringer has arrived, and he and the princess are engaged to be married.

It's a way to stabilize the unstable status quo without taking a public stance.

"You know what this is meant to be....... what this is intended to do."

"It's ......."

It's a scandal, to say the least. When the imperial family doesn't make any official statements about a rumor of that magnitude, it's both to tacitly imply that it's true and to later dismiss it as baseless gossip.

It's about keeping me from being overly tied to the imperial family in any way.

Probably.

That would be Charlotte's will.

"Once it is known that you are the master of Alsbringer, you will inevitably face danger. Even in the Temple, you're not necessarily safe, and the Demon will target you first. You know that."

"Yes."

I'm the devil, so how can I be a threat to you. That part of the equation doesn't matter, so there's really nothing to lose.

It's not the fact that you're engaged that matters.

I need to build up my achievements.

As word of the Alsbringer's owner spreads through the aristocracy, you'll need achievements to show that you're a badass.

Soon, you'll need to do some hero making.

"It could be any number of things. There will be a demon extermination in the Darklands, smaller groups of demons and bandits, and you have Tiamata, so slaying the undead should be easy. Of course, if you are physically present to ensure your safety, Shanapelle's reinforcements will take care of that for you."

The Empire doesn't like me being dangerous. So you're not literally becoming a hero, you're hero-making.

All that matters is that I was there, and the real fights and battles are handled by veterans better than me. And then I pass it off as something I did. In other words, I eat my reputation alive.

That's good for me and good for the empire.

"I don't intend to do that."

"......."

"You'll have to figure it out yourself, whatever that is."

"Reinhard, I know you're not full of yourself. But if you put yourself in harm's way and get hurt, I'm not going to......."

"My fake reputation, inflated by my fake skills, will put me in more danger, because no matter what I do, if it becomes known that it was made up, it could make things worse."

The bigger the task I didn't solve myself, the more I overestimate my skills. This makes me more dangerous. Of course, the Devil will never threaten me, but this is more to avoid the Temple's scrutiny.

I'd rather be alone than active.

So I'm going to do something with my hands, not hero-making, but something real, and it has to be. Saviolin Tana looked at me, then nodded.

"I thought that's what you would say."

It's almost as if he had a good idea that I wouldn't like that, given my personality.

I don't need someone who is overly stronger than me. I'd love to, but I'm afraid that if I did, they'd become my shackles.

Saviolin Tana stares at me, silenced by my comment that she doesn't need help.

"From now on, special activities will replace all classes, soon. This means that your time in Special Activities will count as time spent in the Temple curriculum."

The implication is that you've become such a special student that you don't mind wandering outside the temple.

"Do you know about Levaina?"

"If it's Leviathan....... Wasn't there a raid there not too long ago?"

"Yeah."

The site of a secret imperial operation disguised as a demon raid. It was there that Duke Granz died.

"Go to Raziern, the capital of Levaina."

There is an investigation into a demonic attack, but I know it's not really a demonic attack.

You're sending me there because there can't possibly be a demonic threat? I know there's nothing to be gained there.

"You'll find Olivia Ranze in the Special Investigations Unit there."

Olivia Ranze.

I was a little taken aback by the unexpected name.

"Go help Olivia. If there's a crisis, Olivia and the people at the Bureau can handle it. There's less chance of anything dangerous happening."

Speaking of which.

It had been a while since Olivia had visited me.

It's not that they didn't come, it's that they weren't in the temple at all.
