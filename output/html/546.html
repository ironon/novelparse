Battlefield Rear Area.

"Your Highness, final checks have been completed."

"Finished this one too."

A place of relative tranquility, even in Hell, with monster cries, human screams, and battle cries and drums all around.

As Adelia debriefed him, Archduke Saint-Thuan looked at the massive array of mechanical devices strewn across the rear.

It's not just Adelia and the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan.

The wizards of the Duchy of St. Thuan were also bustling about, examining the gigantic mechanical contraption.

"I'm nervous because I've never done a trial maneuver before......."

The Archduke stared stoically at the devices, which to the untrained eye looked like the remains of some great building.

"I think it's going to work."

At Adelia's words, the Archduke nodded in agreement.

Researching on the battlefield is too difficult.

The Archduke and Mages, who were supposed to be on actual operations, worked on this long project on less sleep after the decision was made to end the Alliance.

With Adelia, the girl who created the genius artifact that is the power cartridge.

A talent for magic crafting.

The Grand Duke's daughter also helped create the Power Cartridge, but in the end, the Power Cartridge would not have been created without Adelia.

Reinhard, a demon, gathered the children of the Temple Royal class to create an impossible object.

And less than a year later, things were made.

Moonshine and power cartridges.

It was a vital supply for the Allies at this time.

The arc crystal that Redina is using right now is also a modification of the power cartridge.

The Grand Duke of St. Thuan denied Reinhardt's idea.

But as the devil said, the two objects were made.

As if they knew the future.

Reinhardt knew exactly what the kids were capable of.

If so, other impossible things.

Now that we've made a small one, let's make a big one.

Something bigger than the world's largest man-made object.

Believing that it could be done, the Archduke hatched a plan.

The emperor approved, and the girl who designed the power cartridge cooperated fully.

The Archduke suggested that with a child who had created an impossible object, he could teach him the knowledge and skills of the duchy to accomplish another impossible feat.

And after a lot of trial and error, experimentation, and late nights, this is what we came up with.

"I hope this can continue to help you in the future......."

"I hope so, Your Majesty."

The Archduke was holding a blue orb, and Adelia was holding a red orb.

It is such a powerful weapon that it is not meant to be started by a single person.

Archduke Saint-Thuan, Chief Research Officer.

And Adelia, our lead researcher.

If they don't start together, this artifact doesn't work.

"Go live."

It's an artifact that hasn't even been maneuvered because it's only been inspected until the Serandia campaign begins.

No, I wonder if we can call this an artifact.

-currrrrr

Pieces of a giant organ begin to float into the air.

It wasn't even a building, it was a giant mountain that seemed to be standing up.

-Pajik!

Sparks fly, and the organs attach themselves one by one.

-Bam!

Everyone could only stare in disbelief as the behemoth meshed with a dull thud.

A mountain rises.

Soon enough, the giant parts, interlocking and interlocking with tons of dirt, form a cohesive whole.

A giant, mountain-like golem that supports itself on two massive legs.

A giant whose head is so tall that you can't even see it when you look up to tilt your head back.

Adelia stares at the enormity of the work and says nothing.

"Maneuver confirmed."

"We have a short maneuvering time, so we don't have time to waste. We're going in right away."

"Yes, Your Highness."

-Currrrrrr!

The blue energy core at the heart of the behemoth begins to glow.

-digging support!

The flesh of the Colossus fades from the ends of his limbs, as if fading away.

The flesh of a megalomaniac in the limelight doesn't disappear.

is to move it.

Same rear region.

From the top of the Arc Crystal, Redina saw something like a giant mountain emerge from the middle of the monster waves in downtown Serandia.

Something appears, enveloped in a blue light.

She had heard that it was coming.

-Currrrrr!

A golem three times the size of the largest monster on this battlefield.

"Is that....... Titan ......?"

The final weapon of the Alliance, created by combining the technological prowess of the Duchy of Saint Thuan with the genius of Adelia.

Titan, the colossus.

Redina could hardly believe her eyes as she watched the behemoth travel through space, even if it was only for a short distance.

No, it's because of its size. In fact, the distance traveled by that behemoth in space is by no means short.

Because of its enormous size, the spatial movement is sequential rather than instantaneous, so it's like watching a behemoth that blends into the space slowly reveal itself.

-Kugugugung!

Redina watched, frozen, as the energy cannons that poured from the behemoth's grasp began to pulverize the monsters.

-Woof!

Any monsters that are not pulverized by the magic cannon are crushed by the colossus' steps and disappear.

-Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

The Colossus turns and stares at the city of Serandia.

The Titan takes a step toward Serandia.

-Thump!

The kneeling Titan faces one of the warp gates spewing out the monsters, his fist raised high in the air and slamming downward.

With destructive, world-shattering physicality.

-Koooooowwww

Redina watched.

A warp gate, albeit a small one, breaks into pieces and disappears.

Redina gazed at the Titan's majesty through clenched teeth, as if she had found hope in despair.

Breakable.

Non-humans can also break warp gates.

Not yet.

"That's it! Kaier! Kaier!"

It's a battlefield where you shouldn't be laughing, but she's found hope, and she cried out, jumping for joy.

"The Titans have smashed the warp gate!"

Kaier was too deep in the heart of the Arc Crystal to see this.

"I can smash a warp gate with a Titan!"

I shouted to make him feel a little bit of this joy.

"Hey, aren't you going to answer me?!"

In the Arc Crystal, they spoke to each other as internal communicators, so it was impossible not to hear them.

The third time I called out, there was no answer.

Then, she realized that the arc crystal wasn't charging its energy balance.

"!"

As if on cue, Redina descended from the Arc Crystal Observatory and made her way to the core.

When the girl descended the tower and made her way to the Arc Crystal's core power source, she found Kaier lying on the ground.

"Ka....... Kaier......?"

Redina's complexion turned bright blue.



* * *



The Titan's startup time was about seven minutes at most.

It takes a lot of horsepower to power a golem of that size, and the Titan was more of a rush job that could no longer be put off before the big battle.

As such, the amount of time the Titans were able to engage in direct combat was only a small fraction of the overall scale of the battle.

But 7 minutes.

The Allies' jaws dropped when they saw what the Titans could do in that time.

Even as the battle raged on, the Titan's majesty was a majestic sight to behold from anywhere on the battlefield.

Monster Waves.

A colossus that intercepts and crushes those waves.

Soldiers, commanders, knights, paladins, and even wizards.

I couldn't help but feel a sense of divinity in the giant Titan's presence.

The call of the priests is answered by the god of Mado, and the behemoth that seems to have descended upon the world tramples and crushes the monsters.

Perhaps one more god should be added to the five major deities.

If the sum total of magic is like that, then magic is the only god in the world.

Watching the great crusher trample and crush the inscrutable scourge, everyone could not help but feel a sense of divinity that had nothing to do with its substance.

-Whoosh!

The Titan slams his raised fist into the ground.

-Currrrrr!

As if a meteorite had fallen, the ground turned over and the Allied soldiers could see the monsters being buried and crushed.

But God's miracles don't last forever.

-Pajik!

After a seven-minute descent into the world, the miracle of Mado disappears in a blaze of blue light, just as it had appeared.

Seven minutes is a short time.

However, time is only as efficient as the beings who use it.

-Charge! Turn around, turn around, turn around!

Titan's seven minutes was enough time to blow a giant hole in the monster wave.

-Dong! dong! dong! dong!

Miracle-struck, the Allied forces began a renewed assault on Serandia.

Monsters have no fear, no morale, and no will.

However, as much as it doesn't make monsters weaker, it doesn't make them stronger either.

Only numbers and sizes.

They alone are the power of the monsters.

That number had dwindled to nothing.

So, the outcome was set in stone.

The Allies have captured Serandia.



* * *



"The Battle of Serandia is over, Your Majesty."

"You made it through the day....... Good."

I was listening to Eleris' report from the Spires of Razak.

You can watch the battle, but there are monsters everywhere and the Alliance is in the middle of it.

I didn't know if I'd clumsily monitor my surroundings and provoke allies or monsters into a battle I didn't need to be in.

I decided not to engage in combat at this point since I had already struck the first blow.

So I stayed in Razak, with only Elise dispatched.

To be more precise, I didn't want to stand by and watch people die over and over again without being able to do anything about it.

You never know when you're going to have a bad day, and if you do, you're going to be out of control.

The Battle of Serandia is over.

With that, the Allies have accomplished one of their goals.

"We've also confirmed that the Titan was activated in this battle."

"How was it?"

"It was an indescribable sight to see ....... It was like the mountains were moving."

Colossal Titan.

There's also a Royal Class garrison and a sarkegar.

So I knew the Allies were working on a war machine project.

Titan is one of them.

It's a war that doesn't pay much attention to security, but magic is a secretive discipline to begin with, so digging up information isn't easy.

A collaboration between Adelia and the Archduke.

It's not that I didn't want to see it with my own eyes.

There was no such thing as a giant weapon in the original. This one ended up being created by a variable.

Arnaka, capital of the Principality of Saint Thuan.

And in the White Palace, Arnaria, almost all of the guards have been replaced by golems.

Herriot disappeared, and the Archduke worked with his daughter's friend, Adelia, to create a giant war machine called the Titan.

Different plots, different stories, and one of the offshoots will be Titan.

I can't even begin to fathom the amount of resources the Empire poured into making it.

"It has a very short maneuvering time, but if improved, it could play a significant role in future battles."

"I suppose."

It's a weapon fit for war.

We had already broken the warp gates with our preemptive strike, so there were relatively fewer gates and monsters for the Allies to deal with.

With the advent of the Titans, combat became even easier.

Compared to the original situation, the allies are stronger, and we were never there in the first place.

Therefore, dealing with the gate situation is an easier situation than the original.

The battles ahead will be harder, but they'll be better than the original.

But an unfathomable number is the same thing.

The fact that immeasurable numbers have survived does not change the fact that immeasurable numbers are dying.

I wonder if someone I know is dead.

Maybe something happened to someone that was irreversible.

"......."

The Allies are victorious.

However, I was afraid to find out the reality of the Allies.

I couldn't help but dread the news from Royal Class.
