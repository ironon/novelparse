            Episode 501.





I was soon on my way to Port Mokna.

My mind raced. What to say to Riana when I saw her, how well the exorcism and purification was going.

There were a lot of questions to ask and things to check.

Once we arrived, however, the atmosphere in Port Mokna was more than calm, it was ominous.

"There seems to be a problem."

"...... looks like it."

A suspiciously large number of troops stood on the city walls.

Like preparing for battle.

And then, I don't know if it was a sign or not, but a shiver of foreboding ran down my spine that made my skin crawl.

I sprinted through the base and scaled the walls in one fell swoop.

"Ma, Your Majesty......."

"Line....... Hart?"

It wasn't just the soldiers who stood on the ramparts, but also Riana, who had a serious look on her face.

She hadn't expected me to arrive at this time, and the look on Riana's face was one of embarrassment and guilt.

"What's going on?"

"I don't know....... I don't know....... I don't know......."

Riana's complexion was pale blue.

An open field on the outskirts of Port Mokna.

Close to the horizon, walking in the moonlight, was a figure.

Stagger, stagger, stagger.

Dressed in colorful priestly robes and blood-red armor.

What the hell did he do with his hands, both of which were covered in blood.

As if possessed by something, Olivia saw Port Mokna looming on the horizon.

"This is....... What......."





Olivia, on a mission to exorcise demons and spirits, approaches Fort Mokna as if she's been overwhelmed by something.

His whole body was oozing out of his ears, like steam.



* * *



Olivia has the power of the divine spirit.

I know as well as anyone that Olivia has an innate resistance to psychic interference and disturbance.

But something is taking over Olivia's mind.

Clearly, the trait didn't refer to immunity; it referred to a spirit so powerful that even Olivia could be subdued.

The sight of Olivia staggering back from her mission of extermination and purification seemed to strike a bizarre fear into the hearts of the soldiers on the ramparts.

We don't know specifically what happened.

However, something has taken over Olivia's mind.

Riana watched the scene, frozen in place.

The paladins and priests who went out with him are dead.

In Olivia's hands?

"I'll fix it. No one else."

"......Okay."

At my blunt instruction, Riana nodded with a stony expression.

With a quick leap from the ramparts, I walk toward Olivia, who is approaching on the horizon.

Olivia, who approaches with glassy eyes, soon lifts her head and looks at me.

Focus returns to the pupil.

It was a long way off, but I couldn't help but recognize the emotion in his eyes.

Distorted faces.

Quivering lips.

Fear.

Anger.

Hate.

I was reading only negative emotions.

A chill begins to run through Olivia's body as she looks at me with obvious disgust and hatred.

Olivia has mastered the power of Tuan, the god of purity.

I don't use it much, but I've also mastered the opposite power, Kier's power.

He's already been eaten by a dead demon, so he's using the power of corruption.

Olivia takes a step forward, her entire body enveloped in the Sacrament.

As in, when was the last time you stumbled?

With a powerful step, Olivia lunges toward me.

After leaping a huge distance, Olivia leaps again.

With an animal-like movement, Olivia lunges at me in a flash.

First hands-on since becoming a master class.

I never imagined that it would be neither a monster nor anyone else, but a possessed Olivia.

What happened to Olivia.

Will I ever come to my senses?

Can I do that?

I was confused.

I've spent a long time honing the art of finding immobility in the midst of confusion and fear.

My head is spinning, but my heart is calm.

What to do right now.

To subdue a crazed Olivia.

Other than that, there's nothing else I need to worry about right now.

"Whoa......."

Breathe.

Calm your mind and focus.

The flow of mana is extremely disciplined and refined, compressing unnecessary mana to the limit.

and compress it.

I don't use it for anything other than strengthening my physical body.

Olivia's arms, stained by the darkness, lunge at me like a beast, stretching out both arms, and I sweep them away with my bare hands.

-Carded!

Arm and arm collide with an unearthly sound.

"Evil spirits......."

"Great......!"

"How dare you, who did you touch?"

I slapped Olivia on the back of the head.

-Bam!

The blow was heavy, like a boulder being sent flying, and it sent Olivia sprawling across the field a dozen times.

You can't use a sword.

Because you can't kill Olivia.

"Great......."

After bouncing around for a while, Olivia staggers back to her feet.

I was trying to stun him, but maybe I should have hit him a little harder.

"Off......."

Olivia covers her face with one hand and begins to let out a stifled moan.

"κ΅¬λ¦Ό....... 흐....... 흐흑....... 끄흐흐흑......."

It was a bizarre cry.

Bright red tears well up in Olivia's eyes.

Is that the torment of the spirits that possessed Olivia?

Or is it a pain that I have to fight unwillingly.

Or both.

A pall of smoke rises from Olivia's body.

Through the smoke, something resembling a human figure appears and disappears.

As if so many demons have taken up residence in the body that the body cannot bear them and they are released.

"ugh....... ugh....... ugh......."

The sight of Olivia was pathetic, terrifying, and monstrous.

We don't know if Olivia is suffering, or if the spirits are suffering.

"Ewww....... Ugh!"

-Kaaaaaaaaaaaah!

-Currrrrr!

The black smoke from Olivia's body hissed loudly, and the grasses of the moor were ripped up, creating a massive shockwave.

-die.

-die.

-die.

-keep alive.

-Why me?

-I want to live.

-hhhblack.......

That wasn't all.

The shockwave didn't just generate a gust of wind, it also gave me the uncanny sensation of hearing thousands of people whispering in my ear at the same time.

But only for a moment.

Head.

I felt like I was going to explode.

While I was mesmerized by the enormity of the whispers that momentarily blew my mind, Olivia was right under my nose.

-Quack!

Olivia's outstretched fist struck me, and I was sent bouncing back several dozen meters with a dull thud.

-chieftain

"......."

Blocked.

Even as I blocked, the spot on my wrist where Olivia's fist had struck was dying.

The power of Kier, God of Corruption.

When killing Leviathan, I used Corrupted Tiamata to kill the guy who was constantly regenerating wounds.

Tainted by the Corruption, Leviathan Lance was unable to recover from his wounds and died.

Olivia's attack, using Kier's power, attempts to break through my magical barrier and corrupt my body.

-Woof!

Finally, he summons Tiamata and focuses his holy power on the wound.

Recovery isn't impossible, but it's definitely slower.

Kier's power suppresses Tuan's resilience.

My wrist is cramping.

Olivia is strong to begin with.

-Khhhhhh!

But now I felt like I wasn't dealing with just one Olivia, I was dealing with tens of thousands of enemies who hated and loathed me at the same time.

It doesn't stop there.

Hate, resentment, and the screams of those who don't want to die clutter my head as if they are a curse upon me.

You need to focus on the battle.

Olivia must be subdued.

However, I'm not hearing what I should be hearing.

The deafening pain and disorienting thoughts would suddenly give me dizzy spells, as if they were actually trying to invade my mind.

-Bang! Quack!

Olivia's physical assault doesn't stop there.

Corruption-powered attacks pierce my defenses and rot my body in real time.

When the power of Tuan, the god of purity, is reversed, it becomes a force of great corruption.

It was an unholy force that felt like it would burn my skin just by touching it.

The only reason I can withstand this onslaught is because of the power of Tiamata.

Apparently, the demons in Olivia's body had enhanced both her physical abilities and Kier's divine powers.

Olivia's holy power was already strong, but not to this extent.

-Sigh!

"......!"

The Tiamata disappeared from my hand and appeared in Olivia's right hand.

Me and Olivia share a tiara.

A bizarre situation was unfolding, with Olivia snatching the tiara I was holding.

That wasn't the end of the story.

-Kurung!

A black lightning bolt fell from the sky, and Tiamata, who had been radiating divine power, was instantly transformed into the form of a cursed magic sword.

Magum Tiamata.

Olivia comes running in with it.

You don't have time for initiative battles with Tiamata.

-Quack!

I had no choice but to take it as an alsbringer.

Gone are the days when, as in the past, Olivia was an overwhelming force to be reckoned with.

I made it to the master class, Olivia didn't.

Plus, I'm not your average master class attendee.

Because of the extreme efficiency of horsepower enhancement, I am able to produce more power than other master classes for the same amount of horsepower.

Plus, it has an overwhelming amount of horsepower.

So in power, I am overwhelmed.

-Carded!

"Great, great, great......."

Pushed back in the sword-for-sword struggle, Olivia lets out an animalistic growl and is knocked backward.

In strength, in power, I outpace Olivia.

That wasn't the problem.

"Crazy......."

The corruptive energy flowing from the accursed Tiamata was rotting my flesh.

I wonder if this is what it's like to die in real time.

If that power is my enemy, I have no problem with it.

Just kill it before it gets too long. That's it.

I can't kill Olivia, and if this goes on long enough, my arm will eventually break. And then it's over.

-Zing!

"Ugh......!"

And then, periodically, the wailing of the spirit, like a tidal wave, seemed to hit my ears and my psyche directly.

Not just physical attacks, but the power of corrupted divine forces and the curses of spirits.

A normal person would have gone crazy or died from an attack by any of those three.

You can't kill Olivia.

But if I don't kill it, it might kill me.

-kill the king....... kill.......

In the distance, on the wind, I heard such echoes.

On the horizon of the open field, a horde approaches.

-keeeeeeeeeeee!

Ghost Horse.

I could see the knights gliding across the field on their phantom steeds.

Death knight.

They all looked like they'd been dead for a while.

Paladins sent to perform a cleansing ritual have died.

Then, by the power of Olivia and the spirits, he was revived as Death Knight.

Once, Olivia and I fought a Death Knight tooth and nail in Raziern, the capital of the Kingdom of Levaina, where the cultists had appeared.

In time, Olivia now has the power to create such a Death Knight with her own hands.

It's just that it's using that power to attack me.

Dozens of ghost horses are running toward me.

It was too much to handle at the time, and it was Olivia, not me, who handled the Death Knight.

Time has passed.

Just as Olivia has gone from killing Deathknights to being able to unleash them.

I can't compare myself to what I was then, and I can't compare myself to what I am now after returning from Rizaira, or to what I was before I went there.

"Suck!"

-Woof!

-skuck!

Before the charging ghost horse could react, I had dismembered it and Deathknight simultaneously. In an instant, what was once Edina's paladin had been bisected.

Eventually, the eerie realization dawned on me that I was merely killing a former ally twice.

It's not just the Death Knights you have to deal with.

-Quack!

The real enemy I still had to deal with was Olivia Ranze.

The momentum of Olivia running up from behind and kicking me with her weight sent me bouncing wildly and rolling across the floor.

The impact didn't feel too bad, but the side of my body that was hit was stinging.

It's not the shock that's the problem, it's the proximity to Olivia and the corruption.

The Death Knights spin and charge with bizarre maneuverability.

You stand up again and grab the Alsbringer.

An Alsbringer is an object that lends you strength when the enemy is stronger or more numerous than you.

I am stronger than them.

However, Alsbringer still lends a hand when you're outnumbered.

In a moment of exhilaration, I tried to paint a picture of how I would handle the uncanny maneuverability of the charging ghost horse and how Olivia would be subdued.

-Flash!

A thunderstorm washed over the world.

-Currrrrr!

As a thunderstorm rips through the world.

-Quack, quack, quack!

Lightning began to rain down on the Death Knights.

The flesh of the recently deceased Death Knight bursts open, and the bones that make up their true flesh begin to burn and gradually turn to ash.

I turned my gaze toward Edina's walls. Through her contorted expression of despair, I see Riana reaching out.

It feels like I'm killing an ally twice, even if it's just to bring them back from the dead.

Riana was feeling similarly. No, I felt like I was feeling even worse.

I could see the despair and guilt in Riana's eyes as she realized what she had done, the loss of her longtime comrades-in-arms, and the humiliation of having to deal with their deaths.
