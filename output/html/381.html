Conditions in the master class.

When you've reached the point of extreme enchantment activism where you can enchant things you hold, you're a master.

If so, we're back to the original question.

After all, it does qualify to have enchantments on the armor.

As if to acknowledge my and Ellen's questions, Tana clenched her fists.

"Masters who have trained professionally in close combat are few and far between, but they do exist, and the ones who are worthy of a master class are the ones who can do this."

She stretches her enchanted palm into the air.

-Kurung!

The brief flash of blue magic in her palm assured me that I would be shattered to pieces if I were hit.

"It's the same extreme of magic manipulation, in that it's not just using the magic in the body as a shield, but in short bursts and bursts. Of course, they take it a step further by injecting the magic itself. That's where the paths diverge."

He explained that a master class in melee combat was, after all, only for those who were well beyond the stage of using magic as a shield.

A fighter and a swordmaster have different training regimens.

It's one thing to train to be able to enchant a weapon you're holding, but it's quite another to push the enchantment envelope with martial arts.

Ellen shook her head.

"So you're trained in both, then?"

At the same time that Tana was using her Auror blade, she had just demonstrated a technique that masters of martial arts demonstrate.

Tana's face flushed slightly at the mention of having trained on two completely different paths.

"Well....... Well, that's not true....... I've only trained with swords. I'm familiar with spears, bows, and other weapons, of course, but my training in martial arts is relatively shallow."

"So how did you just do that?"

"......."

She blushed and her lips trembled slightly.

"When you reach a certain extreme, the understanding of other disciplines follows to some extent......."

I'm such a grandmaster that I can do things I know nothing about.

I'm stumbling over my words.

Tana said she wasn't used to teaching anyone, so even though she was a preceptor at the Temple, teaching would be very foreign to her.

"That's great."

"......."

It was quite a sight to behold as the viola player, Tana, blushed to the point of bursting at Ellen's frank admiration.

"It's funny to hear the words I used to hear from my teachers at Temple and then come back to Temple and hear them again from your mouths as students......."

She finally sighed heavily with a bitter smile.

"What I'm trying to say is that now that you've gotten used to using your enchantments in terms of enhanced defense, you need to take it to the next level. And whether you're a martial artist or an armorer, it's common to train to improve the autonomy of your enchantments."

Up until now, you've only used magic enhancements to strengthen your body and increase your physical strength. But now you need to know how to use magic itself offensively.

You'll also need to know how to turn your magical armor, which used to protect your body, into a spear.

And if you take it to the extreme, you get to the point where you're disenchanting an armory, and when you get to that point, it's naturally labeled a master class.

"But even if a Swordmaster-level foe were to appear in your midst, you would not be able to deal with it. Few realize the power of enchantment, and even fewer reach the master class there, so that moment will not come to you anytime soon."

We may be special, but we don't become Swordmasters in a few days.

That's why Tana told Ellen in the first place.

I'm not going to teach you how to be a Swordmaster, I'm going to teach you how to deal with Swordmasters.

"A Swordmaster is no match for a normal human, let alone one who has learned a fair amount of martial arts, or even one who has access to magical enhancements. The same goes for mages. Most offensive spells will be blocked by magical shields, and the ones that might work will either be close enough to kill the opposing mage before the casting time is up, or they will flee out of reach."

No matter how many unusual qualities we possess, we are no match for the Swordmaster.

"So there's only one best way to do it."

She holds still.

"Ambush."

He told me something that any assassin should know.

"No matter how many master classes you take, you can't stay enchanted all the time, and there's always a moment when you're defenseless. You can't always be sensitive to what's going on around you."

Ambush.

It's cheesy, but there's nothing else we can do. Some of the things he said were so realistic that I panicked.

"Keep in mind that of the many master classes that have existed in history, more have died by assassination than have died honorably in battle."

Saviolin Tana's advice was more important than I realized.

More often than not, kills were made in traps, ambushes, or while they were asleep, rather than in hand-to-hand combat or on the battlefield.

"What if we have to go head-to-head?"

At Ellen's words, Tana gets serious.

"Run away, assuming that's even possible."

She wasn't playing around.

"What if I can't get away?"

It's a tough conversation, but a necessary one.

If you can't run away, you're in for a fight.

"If you can't run, surrender. You are more likely to survive if you are at the mercy of the enemy than if you fight back."

For us to fight the Swordmaster would be as bad as surrendering." Her expression was serious, and she wasn't mocking us at all.

Seriously, I was talking about what we should do when a master class appeared in front of our eyes that was trying to kill us.

If you can't take them by surprise, don't fight them head-on.

If you can't even run away, you might as well surrender.

"What if the other person is someone who has no chance of saving my life?"

This time it was my question.

In the first place, she's telling us this to tell us not to fight the master class.

Ambush, flee, surrender.

When all options are gone and there is no other way but to go head-to-head. What do we do.

"I will teach it to you now. But don't be arrogant enough to think that learning it will enable you to beat the master class."

Tana couldn't have been more serious.

"You can't kill an elephant with a toothpick."

It was a no-brainer.

"Keep in mind that I'm teaching you this because I want you to poke an elephant in the eye with a toothpick and walk away. Of course, even that won't be easy."

What if.

She wants us to survive for a long time.

We don't know when the fight will come, we don't know who will target us and when and where.

That's why it teaches us how to deal with a force that's too much for us to handle, or a situation that's too much for us to handle.

Swordmaster.

Archmage.

Demons.

Demons.

Monsters.

And an army.

It's not about winning.

How to deal with it.

She was trying to teach us how to survive a situation that we never know when we might encounter.



* * *



How we would survive an encounter with the Swordmaster if we had to go toe-to-toe.

The odds were so close to zero that Tana said we might as well surrender.

"Use obstacles. A Swordmaster's senses transcend those of a mere mortal, but our best sense of perception is sight. Whether it's scattering sand or throwing large objects, try to block your opponent's view."

Somehow.

The sordid tales began to emerge.

"Use noise. After the eyes, the second sense is hearing. It's also the sense that's activated the most when your vision is blocked. Alternatively, you can try to avoid noisy areas."

Sprinkle some dirt and make a fuss.

It's too real to be grandmaster's advice, and I imagine myself actually doing it, so it's something.......

That makes me sad.

"Assuming it's an enclosed space, it's best to start a fire if you can. Fire provides noise while also blocking visibility due to smoke. Also, breathing is fair game. You can hold your breath for a long time, but not forever, and while the heat may not be a threat to the Swordmaster, breathing in the smoke is dangerous to him."

It teaches you how to run away, not how to deal with it.

I know you're right, but.......

I'm being treated like an expectant member of the human race, being taught to throw dirt, make noise, and start fires.

"......."

"......."

Neither Ellen nor I could figure out what was what.

Tana punched Ellen when she had an opening, but in real life, Ellen would have been dead in that moment.

"Don't try to cross swords."

"Don't even try to spill it."

"Avoid all fire."

It should be avoided.

Easier said than done, but is it possible.

"And don't even try to attack. You won't be able to handle the power of the sword, and the moment your weapon touches the enemy's body, the same thing will happen to you as it did to the sword."

Don't even try to attack. If you think you've stabbed your opponent in the nape of the neck, the reactionary force will twist your wrist or bounce it backwards.

In the end, I was told to focus on running away and not try to fight it.

"Under normal circumstances, yes."

Tana looks at the two of us as if she's going to tell a different story from now on.

"I sent Klippmann and Ludwig back because there's no point in them hearing this story. Of course, it was also to hide the fact that you are the holders of the holy relic."

What we both have in common.

You possess a holy object in the form of a sword.

"As you can imagine, just bumping into an auror blade was enough to send the ramen flying."

"Yes."

"A normal sword would have shattered upon contact with the blade, not the Auror Blade. The Auror Blade is a powerful weapon in its own right, an enchantment that no other magic can match. Unless a sword is made of a very hard substance or has powerful magical protection, it is safe to say that no sword can withstand a head-to-head encounter with an Auror Blade."

"......I see."

It's not just about being sharp. Depending on the skill of the Auror Blade wielder, the blade can be used to deliver a powerful counter-impact, such as by exploding the magic within the blade upon impact.

A normal sword is not cut by the blade, it is shattered just by hitting the sword face.

She looks back and forth between me and Ellen.

"Rament and Tiamata are holy objects. They won't break or lose a tooth against an Auror Blade, and if you miss, you can always summon them because they're soul-bound. So even if you're facing an unreasonable ability like Auror Blade, you've got the basics covered. The minimum baseline of not losing your weapon."

Unless you have a very powerful magical weapon or artifact, you won't even be able to compete in a master class.

"But you can only take it so far. The moment you try to meet the sword head-on, the reaction force will create a gap, and that's it."

After saying that to Ellen, Tana looked at me this time.

"Reinhard, your situation may be different."

"Different?"

"Assuming you can use Tiamata's holy power. If you can enchant your sword with divine power, it will protect Tiamata and you considerably from the anti-elasticity of the Auror blade."

A sword and myself, not painted with magic, but enhanced with holy power. Does this mean that the immense destructive power of the Auror Blade will be less impactful?

I've never faced an Auror Blade, but I think I know what Tana is talking about.

In practice.

While imbued with divine power, he was able to take a few blows from the monstrous attacks of Leviathan Ranze, who had similarly enhanced his sword with divine power.

Leviathan was not a Swordmaster, but I didn't think he was inferior to a Swordmaster.

After all, even a universal Swordmaster wouldn't be a monster that could survive being stabbed through the heart.

I was able to deal with him because of external conditions, but also because the divine power of Tiamata herself was very helpful.

Dealing with Auror Blades.

I can to some extent.

"Assuming you have access to divine power, you can take the Auror Blade. And Ellen."

"Yes."

"Ramen should be able to penetrate the Swordmaster's magical defense. Of course, a stab would be more likely."

A sword with auror blade-level sharpness that runs like a passive.

Since Ellen can't control it herself, she can't use it as freely as Tana the Xavier's Auror Blade.

But its sharpness and cutting power is overwhelming.

"If you guys are together in that situation, you have a better chance of surviving."

Tiamata can withstand but not kill, and Ramen cannot withstand but can kill.

While I hold on, Ellen pokes.

You can't fight a master class unless you're in it together.

"If the two of you are not together, Reinhardt, you will hold off the attack as long as you can, obscure the enemy's view, stabilize the situation, and then flee."

"Ellen, the same goes for you. If they're watching you, they're not going to give you a break. Any fumbling attempts at stabbing will get you killed. So watch your enemy's sword and dodge it, inflicting only a slight wound rather than a fatal blow, and letting him know that your sword is a threat. He will panic, and that will give you time to escape."

In the end, Tana concluded, don't even think about taking on the Swordmaster unless you're in it together.
