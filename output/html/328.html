            Episode 328.





You can't tell a person's goodness or evil from their appearance. The person in front of you who looks like he could crush an ant to death might actually be a demon who sucks the blood of children.

Ms. Bell looked genuinely perplexed.

"Mmm, I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't think I'd be able to say that out of the blue......."

The answer is, of course, no.

"I don't know what the child care funding looks like, and I don't know how that money is given out. I don't know. I'm not a part of it."

I let out a deep sigh.

After the victory in the Demon Kingdoms War, the government immediately started a support program for the many orphans that were created.

In fact, when I landed in the ecliptic, I seriously considered whether I should just go into a daycare or something. That's because I knew I would definitely have support in that area.

There was also a set-up where war orphans who showed promise would be accepted into the temple and educated for free, even if they weren't in the royal class.

So first of all, it doesn't make sense that there are nursery school kids in the zodiac with no money, no clothes, and bellyaches.

They're starving because they're missing a hole somewhere.

It's clear that things that should rightfully belong to the children are being siphoned off.

In the first place, the organizations that Olivia supports are all just funneling money down the middle and not really helping the people who need it.

So when I told Olivia about this, I didn't say anything about her sponsorship per se, but I knew there was something going on.

Speaking of which, I'm going to use my hands.

I crossed my arms over my chest as I looked at Ms. Bell, who had a world-weary look on her face.

I don't know how the nursery business works.

This person may actually be innocent.

"Teacher, I won first grade at this Temple tournament."

"How about that......?"

"The winners of the Temple Tournament have a chance to meet the Emperor."

"!"

I watch Mr. Bell's face go white. I smirk.

"What do you think would happen if you told the Emperor that this nursery was stealing your money and funneling it down another hole somewhere?"

"What the hell, do you think we're going to be okay with that?"

"As long as you're strong, you'll be fine."

"What are you talking about, student! I, I would never....... Me, not at all......."

Mr. Bell's complexion turned pale and he began to tremble. If I tell the Emperor this story, he may or may not give me instructions.

But the mere fact that I was talking scared him.

Sins that don't exist may be created, and sins that do exist are bound to be exposed.

Is this man of integrity?

Just by looking at that look on his face, like he was going to die right then and there, I just knew that he was playing with the kids' plates.

"Ha, student. Spare me just once. Ha, just once....... It won't happen again......."

-Pak!

"Ouch!"

I shook off Mr. Bell, who grabbed my crotch and hung on.

"Why do I get to decide if you live or die?"

I look down at the middle-aged woman, a good-natured-looking woman, lying on her stomach.

How many people have been fooled by good intentions?

I don't know what they did to the money that was supposed to go to the kids.

All of Olivia's money from selling her personal items would have been siphoned off in this way, and if she had won the prize money and donated it to the orphanage, it would have gone somewhere.

"That's Imperial law, not me."

Outside the window, the kids and Olivia were giggling and playing.

I was in the director's office, watching the director of the nursery kneel before me.

I didn't think Olivia needed to know this.

He didn't want Olivia to realize that what he'd been doing all this time was really just floating the wrong boat.

It's already hard enough.

I didn't want to make it harder for them.



* * *



After watching Olivia and the kids play for a while, we left the nursery.

The kids were disappointed, and Ms. Bell didn't dare go anywhere near where I was.

"What did you talk about?"

"When does the support policy start, blah, blah, blah."

"Hmm, yeah? I hope it starts soon."

It had been in place for a while. We've been fooling backers like Olivia all this time with the excuse that we're not eligible for support.

I didn't think it was necessary to tell you this. I don't know how much of a void I would feel if I found out. I would feel betrayed.

You don't need to know the whole truth.

Sometimes you don't need to know the truth if it's going to hurt you, and Olivia has already been hurt too many times.

I may not be able to punish them myself, but I will be able to press charges. I don't know what punishment everyone will face, but I'm going to find out about the other orphanages Olivia sponsors.

If Olivia wants her children to be well fed and well clothed, it will happen.

"Reinhardt, you're a great guy, but the kids are really struggling."

"......I hate kids."

"Hmmm. I didn't realize you had a weakness like that."

"Why is disliking something a weakness?"

"A weakness, then. Normally I'd expect you to say something harsh like, "Wow!" or something."

I can tell because he's not kicking me out with his usual harsh words.

"Hehe, do you still have to play nice with my kid?"

"No, what are you talking about?"

Smiling at the bash, Olivia seemed to be in a pretty good mood.

That's it.

"Eat."

-cringe

"......."

"It's for human consumption."

"Well, that's just me....... I know."

Radia Schmidt carefully took the bread and milk offered by the vampire and set it aside.

It was given to her to eat, but she couldn't get her hands on it.

Radia Schmidt crouched in a corner of the ring, shivering.

The vampire nonchalantly walked away and returned.

He could have tried to run away, but he didn't. He was too afraid to let himself get away so easily.

'Okay, you're not a stupid kid, thank goodness.'

The vampire who brought her bread and milk even stroked her hair gently, as if he knew she hadn't tried to escape.

Everything was scary, but Radia was most afraid that it was broad daylight.

"How do vampires....... How do you get to....... during the day?"

It's common knowledge that vampires only move at night.

Yesterday, when I was disguised as an ordinary merchant, it was still indoors, and when the battle took place, it was night.

But there was a vampire strolling around in plain daylight.

He even bought bread and milk.

The vampire smiled at a stunned Radia.

"There are no absolutes in this world."

It was an oddly kindly smile. Yesterday's eerie glare, murderous words, and a series of spells of massive destruction I'd never seen before seemed to have vanished.

In front of you is a vampire mage who can slaughter hundreds of thousands with a wave of his hand.

Reinhardt with minions of this caliber.

Demon.

Radia now knows that Reinhardt is such a person.

Radia doesn't know why the demon is the owner of Tiamata.

But now he was terrified and could only hope that it would kill him without turning him into a vampire.

What does this vampire want to do to himself?

Radia doesn't know. She can only pray to God that she can die peacefully.

The vampire looks at himself.

"Hmmm....... ?"

"......."

"It's winter, it must be cold....... We don't have any heating......."

She puts her hands on the floor and shakes her head.

-Bam!

The heating element was summoned, and the room began to warm up.

"How is it, is it warm?"

"......."

Radia could only cringe harder.

What the hell did he want with her, she couldn't tell. All she could do was tremble in fear, not knowing what the terrifying vampire was trying to make of her.

The vampire sighs heavily. He stares at Radia.

"Don't be too scared. Let me know if you need anything."

"......."

As if to reassure her not to be afraid, the vampire walks over to her, sits down, and puts a hand on Radia's trembling shoulder.

"I understand that you're scared because of the situation, but you don't have to be that scared."

"......."

"It won't hurt you, so don't worry about it."

The more affectionate the vampire became, the more Radia's fear intensified.

"Hey, you want me to....... What do you want......?"

So Radia pushed through her fear and summoned all the courage she could muster to say so. At her question, the vampire shakes his head.

"Nothing?"

"Then....... Why are you keeping me like this....... like this?"

"I will not make you a vassal or a clan because you do not want to be, and because the Lord does not yet trust you."

Radia Schmidt looks at Eleris in despair at the words.

"If you kill me....... Why not....... normally."

Knowing Reinhardt's identity, Radia couldn't even formulate words to defend herself.

Fearful of becoming a vampire, he betrayed his comrades in arms.

Even if Demon King was an apostle of Tuan, his sins are deep.

So Radia is deeply guilty, and now she just wants a clean death.

"I can't do that because I don't like it."

Trapped in this dark basement forever. Until the words to become a vampire come out of his mouth, unable to die.

I feel like a human being being fed to a vampire.

Seeing the look on Radia's face, Elise shook her head, as if she knew something.

"You can't go back to the temple, but you can still go out. Of course, you'll have to come with me wherever we go."

"......?"

"I'll tinker with your appearance a bit, in case anyone recognizes you, but if you want to go somewhere, say so, if you want something to eat, say so. If you want a change of scenery, I can even teleport you somewhere far away, never mind the distance."

Radia Schmidt realized there was something off about this vampire.

"If you have family, you can go see them. Of course, I'll have to be nearby to keep an eye on them, but I'm sure you can understand that, right?"

"Oh, no...... family is....... so......."

"Oh, right, sorry."

"Oh, no, not......, I mean......."

Is this what it means to be bred?

Radia had a sneaking suspicion that she had made a huge mistake.

A vampire in front of you.

And Reinhardt.

Radia had no idea what was going on.

The central imperial palace tetra of Emperor Emperatos.

Returning from an urgent meeting with his ministers, the emperor sat in his study with the prince and princess in front of him.

Bertus and Charlotte weren't at each other's throats as usual.

This is because they know it's a bad situation.

The last thing you want to do now is offend the emperor.

"Last night, Revere Lance was found dead along with a number of elite paladins in an abandoned monastery in the southern outskirts of the ecliptic."

The Imperial Emperor, Neliod de Gradias, delivers the facts in a straightforward manner.

"We believe it was caused by demons."

"Is there a connection between what happened last time and....... with what happened last time?"

At Bertus's question, the emperor nodded.

"I can't say for sure, but the circumstances seem to indicate that's the case."

The Demon War is over, but powerful demons survive. They are capable of unleashing massive raids on the ecliptic.

Last time there were no casualties, but this time there are.

Leviathan Lance, leader of the former Crusader Knights and one of the heroes of the Demon War, has died.

But the emperor, the empress, and the three princes had strange looks on their faces.

"......God help the empire."

At the Emperor's words, both Charlotte and Bertus could only nod, albeit shakily.

The arrival of super demons in the ecliptic was the worst of all possible worlds, but the three of them knew that while it was disconcerting, it was good in the long run.

"What died in that place....... Leviathan, as well as the heads of the nameless order?"

"I don't know the exact configuration, but it should be."

At Charlotte's question, the Emperor nodded again.

A secret religious order organized by Leviathan. The nameless order's coffin was already known to the Empire.

However, we were unable to do anything about it because it would have caused a lot of uproar in the sensitive religious community.

Assassinations are also difficult. Not only was Levereer Ranze himself a skilled man, but his lieutenants were veterans who were used to fighting.

Even if the assassination is successful, it's a given that the imperial family will be blamed.

And so it was that the imperial family was left wondering how to deal with the growing seeds of division.

Then, overnight, they were wiped out.

An unspecified number of civilians have even seen flying demons flying in the neighborhood. The imperial family is not behind this, nor can it be mistaken for one.

The rise of the Demon Remnant is bad enough, but the Empire has been left with its hands tied.

"Do you have any idea why the demons attacked the Leviathan and not the Crusaders?"

"Other than wondering if there was a personal vendetta against Leverier Lance....... I'm not sure."

That's all Bertus could come up with.

"I think it's more about whether the demons knew about the nameless order and attacked."

"If I had known, I would have left them alone......."

"That's right."

If the demons knew the purpose of the Nameless Order, they would realize that leaving them alone would weaken the empire, so they must not know about it, they concluded, and they were right.

Even in the heart of the empire, we don't know what's going on, because we can't assume that the demons are trying to protect the empire.

So I was left in the dark.

The louse is gone, but the louse has been replaced by another louse.

Very powerful demons are alive and well, and can attack the ecliptic at any time.

We don't know if the demon is truly resurrected, or if it has a successor.

However, everyone in the Empire has come to realize that the Demon War is far from over.

They knew it would be good for the empire for a while.

A hallway in the Tetra of the Central Palace, after you've finished enlightening the Emperor.

Bertus and Charlotte were walking down the hallway to leave the Central Palace.

"What do you think, brother."

"......what."

"The kid you're looking for. Possibly involved in this."

"I don't want to hear any bullshit."

Despite her words, Charlotte had a lot on her mind.

"Unless he's the son of the devil or something......."

"Shut up."

Charlotte looks up at Bertus with sullen eyes.

"What are you trying to say? I'm the reason the devil's son is alive and living with you, so this whole situation is because of me. I should have died a peaceful death at your hands. Is that what you want to say?"

Bertus shook his head and smiled at the mingled words of Charlotte's enemy.

"No? I'm just saying that I'm so glad that's not the case. I mean, you could have made a really fatal mistake, couldn't you?"

Without an empire, competition is meaningless.

The look of malice on his face made Charlotte feel sick.

Someone needs to hear this conversation, and there's no one else who can hear it.

It doesn't make any difference who hears it.

"...... asshole."

Bertus' comment about wishing the child was the son of the devil or something like that makes sense.

Charlotte knows what you're thinking.

Even if a remnant of demons remain, they cannot bring down the Empire. The Darklands are practically destroyed, and the Demon Castle has fallen.

The remaining demons can't do much more than guerrilla warfare.

So when the remnant demons find a focal point and stir up a ruckus, the empire will be disrupted, but not torn apart.

From that perspective, Bertus wants to see a successor to the Demon King.

Charlotte knows that.

This situation, while incomprehensible, is ultimately good for the empire.

Is this child really related to the devil?

He was just an overly normal kid with no real talent.

But she also knew that she couldn't completely deny the possibility.
