I'm choking.

"Uh......."

Without any rhyme or reason, I stopped dead in my tracks, feeling as if someone had suddenly squeezed the air out of my lungs.

"Reinhardt? What's wrong?"

"......Are you in shock?"

I checked out the information on the bodies and talked to them in another room for a while, but suddenly I felt strange and Herriot and Bertus looked at me.

"No, just some......."

No, it's not like that.

I've definitely seen some horrific sights, but there's no reason to suddenly choke up.

The sensation of not being able to breathe, as if someone is choking you for no reason or premonition.

An uncanny feeling that something big is about to happen. This intense feeling of anxiety for no reason or cause was something I'd felt before.

It was similar to the symptoms of panic disorder I used to suffer from when I had a lot on my plate. The sudden sense of crisis in a calm state was both unfamiliar and familiar.

"What's wrong....... Reinhard......."

He held my hand steady as I broke out in a cold sweat and shivered. It made me feel somewhat better, but I couldn't escape the strange feeling.

I used to have panic disorder. I know this isn't the kind of feeling that comes from that.

This is a chi warning.

I've never felt so close to a crisis that I couldn't breathe.

What's going on, no, what's happening?

Is there a chance that Lothar Dwyn will attack us from the Ministry of Magic, or something like that, and if so, hasn't he left the Ministry yet?

I had never felt this level of pressure before, so I was afraid that something was going to happen that was going to be different, but I wouldn't know what it was until it happened.

Something will happen.

You don't know what it is, so you can't freak out about it.

"Whoa....... Uh, that just came out of nowhere."

Taking a deep breath, Bertus smirked.

"I thought it looked familiar, but I guess it wasn't?"

"I can't believe it. I can't stop thinking about...... I can't stop thinking about......."

They seemed to think I was traumatized by what I had seen.

It was such a horrible sight that I'm not surprised I had this reaction.

The real reason was different, but when I seemed to calm down, Bertus crossed his arms and began to talk.

"By the way, did you know that Lothar Dwin wanted to know where the grimoire came from?"

"Yeah, I'd say he's kind of covetous....... I think he was more curious about where the grimoire came from than anything else....... I wonder if that's why he tortured people like that."

He did this not for the money, but for the source of the grimoires. Of course, they took all the grimoires.

Those words reinforced my suspicion that Lothar Dwyn was a member of the Cantus Magna.

"Maybe there's a newly discovered Richie's grave in that Darklands....... I think that's what I was thinking."

"Oh, you mean......?"

Bertus narrowed his eyes.

"Hmmm. It's certainly possible to think that way......."

Bertus' reaction suggests that the grimoire that was stolen yesterday was located in Ritchie's tomb, so the bait I and the Black Order laid wasn't the one that got them here.

"The important thing is that Lothar Dwyn wouldn't have gotten the information he really wanted by torturing three dead wizards."

This would mean that the dead were unaware of the source of the grimoire.

"More importantly, how the hell did Lothar Dwyn get out of the Imperial Palace, let alone the Ministry of Magic......."

"You said you have no record of leaving the Ministry of Magic and no record of leaving the Imperial Palace."

"Right."

At Herriot's question, Bertus nodded.

"First of all, it's clear that Lothar Dwyn was faking his skills, and based on the level of recording, he shouldn't have been able to handle any of the officers in the first place, but all three of them were subdued and tortured."

Aside from his dabbling in black magic, Lothar Dwyn was actually a mage of even greater prowess.

"But you can't spatially travel inside the palace like you can inside a temple. If you want to leave the Ministry of Magic, you have to go through the Ministry's main gate, and if you want to leave the Imperial Palace, you have to go through the Imperial Palace's four gates......."

I don't know if it's possible to fly in and out like Sarkhegar did. I don't know if Dwyn can transform into a sparrow, but even if she does, I don't think it's possible unless she's completely transformed into that creature like Sarkeghar. I'm sure there's a dispel field in the air.

"But we've searched the entire Ministry of Magic building, and there's no sign of him, and even if he somehow managed to escape, he'd still be in the palace. It's impossible for him to hide with a simple camouflage spell or invisibility."

The only plausible assumption is that Dwyn is hiding somewhere, but he's not in the Ministry of Magic, and they're searching the entire palace and not finding him.

You don't have access to spatial travel, and there's no way you could have casually walked out of the Ministry of Magic building with a cloaking spell.

A man who had the audacity to commit murder in an imperial palace could not possibly be an ordinary man.

If I'm Cantus Magna, can I neutralize the shielding and get away with it?

No.

Probably not.

This is the Imperial Ministry of Magic.

The building itself is huge, and there are probably many departments that fulfill different roles, like the magical research library here.

It's a misconception that spatial travel is impossible within the Imperial Palace.

For now, I'll just set up a spatial travel zone in the basement of the Palace of Spring and set up a warp gate there.

Obviously, I've traveled from outside to inside as well as inside to outside through those tiny gates.

"By any chance, doesn't the Ministry of Magic have some sort of facility for researching warp gates?"

Bertus and Herriot shook their heads at my words.



* * *



Warp Gates are basically Imperial magic.

It makes sense, then, that warp gate research would be conducted by the Imperial Ministry of Magic, which is neither a mage guild nor a magical association, and that it would have facilities for warp gate research underground.

As such, it was inevitable that there would be a small, if not very large, warp gate inside the facility, as research into warp gates was ongoing.

All research had been put on hold due to a murder at the Ministry of Magic, so Bertus called in a representative to speak with him.

"That....... I don't think that's possible."

When asked if the gates here could be activated to connect to gates outside, the researcher shook his head.

"The gates here are not made to a common standard, most of them are research gates for specialized applications. Most of the gates are unfinished, so you can find them here......."

"You mean you have a gate that works?"

There are a lot of gates, but if there's one that works, that means there's a way in," Bertus said.

"Yes. There are working warp gates, and there are definitely non-testing warp gates....... But it's probably not possible to get out of it."

"Why?"

"All of the warp gates that are made in this facility are not regular gates. The gates inside the facility are meant to be connected to the gates outside to create a view of the entire gate system, so these gates have never been connected to the gates outside."

"If it's never been connected, it can be connected, right?"

"Then we'll have to go through the trouble of including these warp gates in the regular imaginary dimension map."

"What does that mean?"

Bertus didn't seem to understand when I said something that only warp gate technicians knew, and neither did I. All I know is that a map of the imaginary dimension is like a subway map.

Herriot looks at Bertus and says.

"Warp gates need rules to determine which gates they connect to and which ones they don't, so each gate needs to specify which gate it's going to synchronize with."

If you want to include a regular gate in your imaginary dimension map, you'll need to add it to the system as a whole, although the gate will also need to exist as a facility of its own.

"So you can't connect without that process?"

"If we connect the gate here to the outside gate without the correct coordinates, it might collide with the path of the other gate, which would cause dimensional distortion and cause......."

"Enough with the complicated story, accidents happen, what kind of accidents?"

"It's also possible that the gate at the arrival point could be affected, causing everyone using the gate at the arrival point to be blown away to a 'place that doesn't exist', not to mention anyone trying to use it to go outside. Of course, I don't know if such a place exists....... There have been quite a few cases in the past where people have experimented with gates and never returned."

Bertus' eyes widened, as did mine and Harriet's.

Where it doesn't exist.

I'm going to be blown away into a nether dimension, and I'm not going to be able to return to the realm.

"So, escape through this gate is impossible?"

"You could try to escape by activating the gate, and you might actually get there safely, but....... It's too risky. It would be a gamble with your life."

I don't know the details, but the principle is simple.

If you add an extra line to a subway station that's already working as calculated by many people, the trains will crash into each other, ruining the line and killing passengers.

The Warp Gate is both a train station and a train itself.

Even if the trains and trains were ready, it would be insane to use this warp gate to escape to the ecliptic, as laying tracks without thorough calculation would cause a major accident.

So if you're using a gate that's already active, you're traveling down a path that's already been created.

In this case, you're creating a path that doesn't exist. This makes it a high-risk gamble.

The artifact I have that leads to the basement of the Palace of Spring is a warp gate distortion device of sorts, but what people don't realize is that the gate to the basement of the Palace of Spring is also a warp gate designed to communicate properly with the outside world.

The representative said that escaping through the facility's gate was impossible and a gamble with one's life.

"No....... would have done it."

But," Harriet said, her voice trembling.

"Saint-Thuan, what does that mean?"

Herriot's face went white at Bertus's question.

"If you had understood the map I showed you yesterday....... you would have been able to......."

I was the only one who could understand Herriot's words.

While I don't understand exactly what Herriot did yesterday, I do know that he did something that will help improve the warp gate system.

And as a lawyer, Dwin saw the results of Herriot's work firsthand.

He's not a geek, he's an expert on warp gate systems.

Calmly, Herriot explained the events of yesterday - or, to be more precise, his theory, not Darwin's.

"A wizard with no knowledge of the warp gate system might not have been able to figure it out, but he was an expert. He understood my theory as soon as he saw it. I didn't use my theory. I annotated the whole thing on a map of an imaginary dimension, so....... If there's a loophole somewhere because some gate is connected in a certain way, or there's a blank in the dimensional coordinates, or for efficiency's sake......."

The uninitiated may not know how to deal with gates, but Rosser-Dwin was an expert in gate theory.

I used what Herriot wrote to formulate his theory.

To formulate his theory, Herriot annotated every existing map of imaginary dimensions.

We interpreted all the piles of imaginary dimensional maps that were beyond the comprehension of many experts, and analyzed all the warp gate connection paths.

"So, even though you can't connect a single warp gate globally, if you understood the map I gave you, you should be able to calculate a safe path to connect to a specific gate."

Herriot's theory is too early to be used in practice.

But as a scientist, Darwin used evidence to make theories, not theories.

The spider web of gates and connections between them was a challenge to organize, but it wasn't hard to create a single, secure path to a specific gate.

"Sure, it's a risky and unproven method....... It's definitely something worth trying......."

By the time Herriot showed him the map, Lothar Dwin was planning the crime.

As he contemplated his escape route after the crime, Herriot showed him the best way out.

"Somehow....... seemed to like it more than a little......."

Beyond the last time he saw the suspect in the crime, Herriot was frozen when he realized he'd been used to escape the Zodiac.

Bertus bit his lip, a serious expression on his face.

"Well, then, it's pretty clear that Lothar Dwin used this facility to escape."

"Sorry....... Sorry......."

At Herriot's blushing apology, Bertus grinned bitterly.

"He was going to get out anyway, he killed three people here, so he was probably going to kill them all on the way out, but because you gave him a safer escape route, what could have been a dozen or a hundred deaths ended with only three."

"......."

so we don't know what Dwin's actual combat power is.

But it easily overpowered three high-ranking mages and killed them.

Even if he had taken a cue from Herriot's suggestion in the first place and made his escape, Lothar Dwin had already planned the crime.

This means that he already had the confidence to escape the palace by force, even if it wasn't through the gate.

So if you were inspired by Herriot's words and escaped through the gate, then what should have been more people dying ended with less people dying.

"Even if it's not, make me think it is."

You have to think that way, even if it's not true.

I appreciated Bertus' words, even though he wasn't a party to them.



* * *



Charlotte and Ellen's investigation didn't lead them to anything conclusive, but rather to suspicions.

Allegations involving Reinhardt.

Charlotte and Ellen didn't have a conversation about where that might lead.

Because the moment you talk about it, something you don't want to imagine might become a reality.

They walked on without saying a word.

Charlotte's next stop was the Identity Bureau of the Zodiac.

It would soon serve as the town hall.

"Even if he's using an alias, he's still registered, and we might be able to trace something back to him. He's probably lying about where he's from and stuff like that, but that in itself might be enough to deduce when he started operating in the ecliptic."

"I see."

A Darklands spy who operated under the pseudonym Elena.

For now, Charlotte was going to track her down as far as she could.

Even a fake identity would have been registered at some point, so there would be a record of where it came from, and in fact, Charlotte had seen her ID and asked her questions, but she didn't remember any of those details, including where she came from.

Obviously, you shouldn't have access to such personal information, but Charlotte is a princess.

Just as Bertus could look up the biographies of all the citizens of the Zodiac with a word, so can Charlotte.

"Show me all the identities registered under the name Elena on the ecliptic."

"Yes, I'll have it ready in no time."

Suddenly, the empress appeared and demanded the documents, and the director began to pace.

In the Director of Administration's office, Ellen and Charlotte waited for the materials to be ready.

They both knew that Elena wasn't the one to dig now.

I don't want to admit it, I don't want to think about it.

Reinhardt's a winner.

You don't have to say it, they know it.

"......."

"......."

They didn't say anything because they knew that if they started talking, something would go very wrong.

How long has it been since then.

"Here you go."

We had a list of all the people in the ecliptic named Elena.

Charlotte would deduce the period of activity from the place of birth and date of registration, and later call the shop's landlord to find out more about Elena.

That's why Charlotte handed over the paperwork for the same-named person.

"This is it."

-pulp

Charlotte pulled out a piece of identification that matched the face of the Elena she remembered.

Charlotte already knew Elena's face, all she needed was the written information.

But.

The documents were the final piece of evidence for Ellen.

"Wait....... Wait......."

"Huh?"

"Me, this person......."

Ellen's voice trembles.

"I know this guy."

Charlotte's eyes narrowed at that.

"What? Where have you seen this guy before?"

Ellen has a good memory. So it was inevitable that she would realize something.

"On a group mission last year in the second semester....... In that castle....... a statue that looks just like him....... I saw......."

I thought it was a different face, but subtly resembled a gargoyle.

A mage named Lelia, who briefly accompanied you in the Darklands.

And the discovery of a gargoyle resembling Lelia in the castle of Epiax.

It stuck with Ellen so strongly that seeing Elena's photo brought the memory back to her.

"A statue? Why does the castle have a statue of him?"

"This person......."

Ellen murmurs, her voice trembling, in intense shock.

"It's a dragon......."

"What the fuck....... No, what the hell are you talking about?"

Charlotte barely suppressed the curse word that threatened to escape her lips as she wondered if this was supposed to be a joke.

But regardless of Charlotte's consternation, Ellen's complexion was turning blue.

Lelia, a mysterious sorceress who claimed to be a dragon.

A statue resembling Lelia in the castle of Epiax.

And a photo of Elena, who looks just like the statue.

In Ellen's memory, the photos of Lelia and Elena never looked like the same person.

But when a connection was made in the middle - a statue, a kind of neutralized look - that was the only thing that came to Ellen's mind.

Lelia, a mage who hid her true skills and followed them.

Reinhardt was there, too.

Ellen has a good memory.

"......Wouldn't it be nice to have one of our own wizards?

Lelia, a self-proclaimed dragon mage, was brought in by Reinhardt on purpose, albeit by accident.

"......."

Ellen couldn't help but squint at Elena's photo.
