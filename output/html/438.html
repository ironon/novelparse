            Episode 438.





There was a grim silence in the room, and no one dared to speak up.

In the room were the five heads of the Lord Vampire family, including Antrianus, as well as Sarkegar.

Elysees vouched for the return of Antirrhinus, who had betrayed her.

Antirrhinus was not a traitor, but rather returned from killing the head of the Cantus Magna.

As for Akasha's whereabouts, Eleris offered minimal explanation.

Akasha is the tool of creation and is now in a safe place.

Per Valerie's instructions, Eleris had moved Akasha to a different location for now.

They were now gathered in the stronghold of Lerouen, not the castle of Epiax.

Epiax was no longer available, as many humans had been sent to investigate.

We all had a pretty good idea of what was going on from the trail of Epiax's collapse.

Radia Schmidt got into a fight with someone and disappeared.

They were informed of the current situation by Epinhauser through Lucinil, who informed them that the Devil was now being held in the Temple.

Radia Schmidt is presumed dead.

And the Demon King and Loyaar are being held in the Temple.

Eleris's complexion was white as a sheet.

"Your clumsy compassion has endangered the king, Elerys."

"......."

At the end of Sarkegar's day, Eleris had no answer.

Clumsy compassion.

Those little cogs made the mismatched pieces come together, and that's how Valier was discovered.

Sarkegar's shapeshifting abilities make it possible to sneak in, but impossible to bring out.

Therefore, only armed conflict is considered.

"The place where you are now being held will be more difficult to enter than the Tetra, the central palace of Emperatos. And any assault on it would require our few forces to enter the temple first. Is it possible for us now to penetrate the temple, and then by force to the dungeon at its core, where your Majesty is imprisoned?"

Neither of them answered Sarkegar's question.

You're not facing a shortstop, you're going into the infield.

That's impossible.

And there are other alliances, aside from the Houses of the Council.

"Is there any chance the Black Order could help us with this?"

At Sarkegar's words, Galarsh shook his head.

"The destruction of Cantus Magna was a condition of our cooperation with the Order. And now that Cantus Magna is long gone, there's no reason for them to give us any more help."

"I'd rather worry about them coveting Akasha."

The Black Order was not here now.

After the events of Ritchie's Tomb, the Council refrained from contacting them until after Akasha was secured, as there was no telling how they would react if they learned the truth about Akasha.

If anything, EpinHauser's reporting of the detention in Bali was an undue favor.

With the Cantus Magna matter resolved and the truth of Akasha not shared with them, the alliance is effectively over. Arguably, by betrayal on the part of the Council.

So asking for help because the Demon King has been kidnapped isn't going to work, and the Order is more likely to ask for Akasha than anything else.

Situations where you can't hope for help from the Black Order.

The only thing that exists is the power of the Vampire Council.

It's impossible to get your Valerie back.

Eleris, the one most responsible for this situation, could only stare blankly.

Balie is about to die.

Antirrhinus, who had been silent, smirks.

"Why not use Akasha?"

"......."

At that, Sarkegar's brow furrowed.

"Didn't you say Akasha is a tool of creation, and how does that help in this situation?"

"That's an oversimplification."

Antirrhinus looks at Eleris with a coy smile.

"Akasha is already a very powerful source of power in her own right. Now, I'm sure the Emperor and the Temple have defenses in place against that level of magic, so it would be difficult to resolve the situation with powerful magic, but....... Why don't you consider that it is a tool of creation?"

"......."

"It's taking the things that make the world, and using them a little differently."

"What do you mean, use it differently?"

"It's like making the world half-assed, half-assed."

Antirrhinus chuckles.

"Half a world makes a world......?"

"Akasha is unfinished, so if we go live now, ....... you'll be building something that's infinitely closer to the world, but not yet the world."

Eleris bit her lip at Antrian's explanation.

Antirrhynchus was never able to see and enter Akasha himself, but he was told about it by Lucren, the head of Cantus Magna.

As a tool of creation, I had to know how it could be used.

We've already heard about Akasha, its uses, and the side effects of using it incompletely.

"It's about making that world collide with the current world with a bang."

"Very big."

"The likes of which no one had ever seen or heard before."

"The dreaded....... There will be a catastrophe of epic proportions."

"Humanity will be thrown into chaos. Castles, bridges, and houses will collapse and be destroyed, and humanity will be in chaos."

"What then?"

"If the world is about to end, shouldn't all those wizards and knights who have been assigned to keep watch over the devil's side leave?"

"To save people, to save lives."

"We're trying to capitalize on that."

"We're going to take advantage of that, and we're going to save the day."

"They have to fix the disaster that has befallen the world, and they don't have time for us trying to rescue the Demon from their clutches."

"With most of humanity dying, or perhaps even destroyed by it, it would be as easy as seeing fire to rescue him and then rebuild the demon world."

"So I'm going to tell you."

"Let's use Akasha, but let's use it unfinished on purpose."

Antirrhinus watched with amusement as Elise bit her lip.

Galarsh, Lerouen, and Lucinil were speechless.

Sarkegar's eyes widened.

"Such a....... Such a way......."

Extinction of the human race.

Demon to the rescue.

The Rebuild.

They had the means to fulfill three of Sarkegar's wishes in one fell swoop.

"I guess there's no other way to do it, no, there's no reason to do it any other way."

Half the human race is gone, or so it seems.

Sarkegaard believes that if you have the means, there's no reason not to use them.

"But....... work?"

Lerouen said hesitantly.

It would be a disaster of epic proportions.

Even if you have a goal of saving Valerie, you can't make decisions like this so easily.

Lucinil looks sadly at Sarkegar.

"I too....... I don't want our Valerie to die, but....... Do we have the right to do that, to cause something like that....... even if it happens?"

Sarkeghar narrowed his eyes at Lucinil's worried words, too big a catastrophe to discuss.

"Humans have destroyed our world."

"They have killed the sons and daughters of the Darklands, enslaved and raped them, and now they seek to destroy our one remaining future, the last hope of securing it."

"They destroyed us, they stole our land, they stole our children, and now they want to destroy our last hope."

"Do you not think that we, or I, or you, have a right to destroy them?"

"Who started the last war, humanity or not?"

"Who the hell has the right to destroy humanity if not us?"

"They destroyed us, so shouldn't they be destroyed as well?"

They destroyed us, so we have the right to destroy them. At that, Lucinil bites her lip and looks at Sarkegar.

To that well-deserved hatred, Lucinil and Lerouen found nothing to add.

Sarkhegar believes that the sons and daughters of Darkland have the right to destroy humanity, so he agrees with Antrianus that Akasha should be left intentionally unfinished.

There's no reason not to choose it.

Even if the demon dies, humanity is doomed.

An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

You have destroyed us, so be you destroyed.

That's not right.

It shouldn't.

We need to find a win-win.

To someone who has had everything destroyed, such talk is the dime-a-dozen hypocrisy of those who have never been in that position.

No one could say anything to the enraged Sarkegar.

"Sure, I can see where you're coming from, but that's not something you can do just because you decide to do it."

Antrianus smiled and spoke to Sarkegar in a soft tone.

"You are the only one who knows where Akasha is right now, and you are the only one who can enter Akasha."

Libraries of the Underground City of Demons.

Now the location has changed, but only three beings can enter Akasha.

Charlotte De Gradias.

Demon Balie.

And Elyse, the ancient archdemon.

Eleris stared at the table.

"......."

Sarkegar is unaware that Eleris is an ancient Archdemon.

But even if you did, it wouldn't make a difference.

A hornless Archdemon cannot be the hope of the realm.

"Elise."

"......."

"Take responsibility for your ugly hypocrisy."

"......."

Sarkegar's words left Eleris speechless.

Valier, who has worked so hard to prevent the Gate from happening, will eventually see it happen as part of a ploy to save himself.

Like fate.

Chasing a gate event causes a gate event to occur.

If you do nothing, you'll be left with the dreaded regret that nothing would have happened.

Eleris ponders.

Should we run. From the council. From everything in the world.

Or, you can kill yourself.

But. what if it does.

After trying to save all humans, Valier dies at the hands of humans.

He dies, not understood by anyone, hated and hated by all those he loved.

His last descendant, with good intentions, dies before he can accomplish a good deed.

Due to your own mistakes.

In return for being drunk on clumsy compassion.

If Valier dies, and Akasha remains hidden and silent, the world will go on as Valier intended, without the Gate ever happening.

Is it still good.

And that's it.

Your hypocrisy kills your last descendant.

If we can save countless beings by allowing their descendants to die, is it right to do so?

But that it was right, that Bali would have wanted it, that countless beings could have lived because of it.

That was the definition.

Is that how you masturbate?

"Elise, are you going to drink in the same hypocrisy to the end and give me this bullshit about every being in the world having a reason to live? Yes, every being in the world has a reason to live, a reason to exist, but remember that the children of Darkland were all such beings."

Sarkeghar's words were wreaking havoc on Eleris' mind.

"Hehe....... The Lord of Peace, who hates and shuns killing so much....... that you should take on this role......."

Antirrhinus's laughter tickled my ears.

"What a....... What a sad fate....... Hehehe. Heh heh heh heh heh......."

While listening to the maniacal laughter of an old vampire who is enjoying this situation so much he can't help himself.

Elise remembers one afternoon, long ago.

As always, it was a lazy afternoon.

No customers, sprawled out on the counter in the boring afternoon sun.

One lazy afternoon, I was just killing time.

The store door opened, and a boy walked in.

A boy who looked vaguely familiar, carrying a fireball scroll.

A boy who somehow had a scroll of demons.

When he realized that the boy was his last descendant.

When I realized it was Valier Jr. the Prince of Demons, who I once tutored for a few days.

Eleris believed that there was some kind of destiny for her.

When the boy said he was going to save the world, that he knew the future.

He believed that his destiny would save the world from destruction, that it would lighten the weight of his sins and murders.

But.

That wasn't it.

Your destiny is your own.

That was the last thing he should have been doing.

He had accumulated so much killing and sin that the hypocrisy he had built up to avoid it had pushed him over the edge.

To repay by murder, by hypocrisy.

Eventually, you'll commit a sin that no one in the world can forgive.

Trying to save everyone.

Killing everyone.

That was his role.

"......."

Well, it was my destiny.
