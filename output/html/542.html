            Episode 542.





We were talking about humanity and stuff when suddenly Kono Lint brought up the almost-fading memory of the pageant.

How long has this asshole been around?

I was even late in responding, which convinced him.

"It was you, you asshole!"

Kono Lint leaned back, his complexion haggard.

"Well, I thought you were a weirdo, but that's not the problem, you're an even weirder weirdo!"

"No, no, no, no, what's that, what's that, what's that, asshole, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know!"

"You....... Why do you have such a hobby as......?"

"It's not a hobby! It's not!"

"Well, at least I know what you're talking about, so I guess that means you're right, right?!"

Dried.

I don't think it was intended, but it dried up nicely.

When did I start to suspect this asshole?

And why do I still remember it?

"Give me back my original, you son of a bitch!"

Kono Lint exclaimed, his face turning white.

"You crazy motherfucker, it was a cross-dressing contest in the first place!"

"I don't know, give it back, you crazy bastard!"

Why are we even talking about this?

I finished, summoning an Alsbringer in my right hand. Konorint's complexion turned white.

"......I knew you weren't supposed to know."

Why am I threatening now?

"I'm sorry. Die."

But Kono Lint was not intimidated at all by the sight of the Alsbringer in my hand.

"Don't you dare lay a finger on me. I'll tell the world you're cross-dressing."

"......."

Why.

Why.

This is what happens!

"I don't trust that any more than I trust your work today, you son of a bitch!"

Who the hell believes the devil won a cross-dressing contest?

I did, but no one believes me!

I should really kill him.

This won't work.

-Whoosh!

I swung Alsbringer and Kono Lint moved to the other side of the room.

"I swung it! I'm going to tell Ellen, you crazy pervert!"

"......."

I felt my blood run cold.

Too late.

You've already been caught.

Beyond Bertus, I've gotten to know this asshole.

"If you don't let me go safely, tomorrow you'll see the whole garrison singing a song about how the Devil is a cross-dressing pervert. You pervert."

I felt like my last shred of sanity had been blown away.

"......I'm a pervert?"

"Well, then you're a pervert. Yeah, if you're not a pervert, what are you?"

One could argue against Kono Lindt's statement.

I'll admit that I did some of the bullshit for a reason, and I was forced to do it.

After all, didn't I come full circle and go through all that bullshit to get to where I am today?

Yes.

I have to admit it.

"Yes, I'm a pervert."

"What......?"

Konorint's complexion turned even bluer at my nonchalant admission.

"Well, do you think that's all there is to it?"

"......?"

"You think my perversions are, like, that bad?"

My cold laugh stiffened Konorint's expression as he stood there, pinned to the wall, ready to flee.

"You."

"Early Admissions."

"First year."

"Initial."

"While eating dessert at a cafe with the kids......."

"I was once confessed to by a girl......."

"You know what?"

Konorint's complexion turns white at my words.

"......what?"

"And that girl, you haven't heard from her since, have you?"

I use Sarkegar's ring.

"That girl probably looks like....... Doesn't she look like this?"

"Uh....... Uhhhhhh?"

A moment of silence.

Honestly, we shouldn't even be having this conversation.

I know I don't have to.

But.

"This, this....... You son of a bitch!"

You've broken my spirit.

You too shall be broken.

'Why did you do that to me....... Why did you do that to me......?'

"You said pervert, that's because I'm a pervert.

'I'm....... but I don't know if I'm eaten by anyone because of that memory......! I used to think that, and then I realized......!

'No way! You've been tricked, you bastard. We're done talking, now get your ass back to the Allied lines!

"You devil, no, worse than a devil!

"It doesn't matter because the devil is actually right, hahahahahahahaha!

'What did I do to you that was so wrong......! I will curse you for the rest of my life, Reinhardt!'

"Go for it! There's a lot more people doing that than you! Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!

With his mental capacity reduced to zero, Conor Lint couldn't quite grasp the situation.

For some reason, Herriot meekly returned the limp Conor Lint to the Allied lines.

Of course, Herriot looked at Reinhardt, who had gone a little sour, and didn't seem to understand either.



* * *



"......."

The sight of the vast Allied advance suddenly snapped Kono Lint back to reality.

As he listened to the sounds of the grass, the soldiers coming and going, and the troops preparing to march, Kono Lint wondered if he had even been with the demon all this time.

Everyone hates the devil.

Few would believe me if I told you that the devil is actually fighting the gate crisis harder than anyone else.

Kono Lint assumed that those in the upper echelons of the Empire, including Saviolin Tana, knew this truth.

That's probably a good thing. That's probably a good thing.

That's because a larger truth had sunk deep into Kono Lint's mind.

Female.

A lingering suspicion in the back of your mind has been proven true.

Transform there.

When Kono Lint realized that Reinhardt could shapeshift, he stood as still as a statue, his mouth agape.

Perverted.

I'm a pervert at the point of cross-dressing, but I can't believe I even did that.

What the hell were you doing, what were you thinking?

It's frightening because I don't know what kind of malicious intent they have.

Reinhardt didn't want any of it, because he didn't want to be used or used for anything.

Only to raise about.

Only to tease.

"Crazy...... asshole......!

Whether the Devil is good or evil, Kono Lint can no longer tell.

The devil is a pervert.

That's it.

Continuing on, Kono Lint returned to the Royal Class garrison, where he saw an armed Ellen.

"......."

I wonder if Ellen knows Reinhardt's truth.

ConoLint doesn't know until then.

But not that truth.

Conor Lint wonders if we know the "other" truth.

It probably won't know it's dead when it wakes up, Kono Lindt is sure.

"I'm....... Ellen."

"Yes."

Ellen looks at Konorint as he finishes singing.

Ellen Artorius has been feeling a little down lately, but now that she has something to occupy her mind, she's feeling a little more energized.

Do I really need to tell Ellen that Reinhardt is actually a cross-dressing pervert, and that he's a crazed pervert who makes fun of his classmates for cross-dressing?

I can't.

"No, I thought I had something to say, but I forgot."

"......?"

Ellen shakes her head and looks around as if that's enough.

"By the way, have you seen the cat?"

"Did you see the cat......?"

"I see."

Apparently looking for a cat, Ellen scurried away.

Cat.

Cat.......

"......."

Fortunately, Kono Lint never got to the point where he thought Reinhardt would turn into a beast.

A few days later.

Ready, the Allied forces began their march.

It was more of a march than an advance. There was a long way to go, a long way to Serandia.

But like any other march, it's not a place to rest.

It's a way into the heart of the enemy, and from that heart comes a constant stream of monsters.

The march was already a battle in itself.

-Bang! Quack!

-Flash!

-Woof!

The entire army was in a state of readiness, not only for the battle, but also for the monsters that would flank the marching troops.

What awaited at the end of the march was not a rest, but an even bigger battle.

When an army is most tired, it must face its hardest fights.

The march through the enemy lines was a march and a battle, and the noise of battle was constant day and night.

The army had to move forward while fighting, and fight while sleeping.

The good news is that in the harsh winter, the weather doesn't freeze the soldiers.

A cool autumnal climate, if not midsummer, was optimal, though the fatigue of the march itself and the constant battles could not be overcome.

-Good thing the weather is nice.......

-What would have happened if it had snowed.......

-The heavens are helping us.

The closer we got to Serandia, our primary operational target, the more monsters we encountered.

"The Empire's fleet has already destroyed three warp gates - one large, one medium, and one small - in a preemptive strike. This should make the assault on Serandia a little easier."

The Major of the Demon Army had already checked the General Headquarters.

This lie would become an increasingly obvious lie. Those who do not know the truth will gradually come to recognize that there are forces aiding this war, and that they are the forces of the Devil.

It's playing with the devil's hand, and if it comes to light, it could split the coalition.

But the temptation was too sweet.

How much combat power can be preserved and how many people can survive in exchange for silence, a little lying, right now.

Everyone realizes that the Emperor Bertus and the leaders of the General Command are hiding an important truth, but no one wants to know it.

Whatever help you can get, it's making the war easier.

Louise von Schwarz, who holds a seat in the mobile command center, was one of those silent mouths.

Does war really need music?

We don't know about music, but we can all agree that we need sound.

-dong-dong-dong-dong

There's something about the thunderous sound of a war drum that instinctively elevates humans.

They say there's a soul in the sound of a drum.

Drums are made from the skins of living things, so maybe that belief is justified.

We don't know if the sound truly has a soul, but it certainly has a role in stirring the human spirit to something.

On any other battlefield, this drumming would be unnecessary, but on this particular battlefield, it's even more necessary.

-Kiaaahhhh!

-Grrrrrr!

-keeeeeeeeeeee!

Only then will you be able to drown out the cries of the raging monsters in the tidal wave of monstrosities from below the hill.

Because we need to push the fear that comes from sound away with sound.

After a long, long march, the Allies finally reach the battlefield and look down on Serandia, the city they must capture and hold.

Already replenished, the monster stood in the craters left by meteors and tornadoes.

-Dong! dong! dong! dong!

The masters beat their drums to tear the grip.

As if drowning out the cries of the monsters would actually make them recede.

You drive back the fiery monsters and smash the warp gate.

Once you've accomplished this seemingly impossible task, it's not the end, but the next battle.

Doomed to be torn apart by the teeth and claws of a monster at any moment.

Next, and next, and next.

And then beyond.

The army of death that must go to the last battlefield must face its first despair.

No thinking required.

Despair is worthless.

Forget it.

You have to fight.

As if to say, don't think about anything but the fight now.

-Dong! dong! dong!

The drums anesthetize the soldiers.

At the sound of it, which colors the soul with rage, the soldiers' eyes are filled with despair, fear, and a premonition of death.

I feel a surge of anger.

There's no place to back down.

There is nothing but death behind, beside, and in front of you.

There is no place for humanity to retreat.

If yes, then forward.

If you're going to die anywhere, go down in a direction that's closer to everyone's survival and victory.

That's what this is all about.

If this or that kills you, take it.

To life rather than death.

In anger rather than sadness.

Rather than despair.

To madness.

Surrender yourself.

-Dong! dong! dong! dong!

The sound of the word drum.

And.

-Mighty, great, and virtuous, the five lords, grant us protection....... Keep us and protect us, and grant us all well-being and peace.......

There were countless soldiers calling out the names of the gods like madmen.

-To our enemies.......

The soldier's eyes glow eerily, drunk with fear and despair.

-to the enemies of humanity.......

In despair, in inscrutability, one can only seek the Absolutes.

-death.......

Good luck with that.

It's not just people who lose their minds and call on the name of God.

-May Allah protect us!

-Thump! Thump! Thump!

At the shouts of the Paladins of the War Gods, a reddish tide begins to pour from the heavens over the entire vast coalition.

God of war.

O god of war who chose the devil.

Make our steps light for today.

-Bang!

The drums of death, beaten by the masters of despair, make everyone surrender their souls.

The commanders of each army raise their swords.

You may be broken, but you won't fall.

-Warriors!

Broken.

-Charge!

You've been knocked down.

-Wow!

Fight.

To survive.



* * *



Humanity pouring down the hill.

Monsters scorching the hills and streaking across the sky.

And the sky.

-rumbling

From the open sky, deathly flames begin to rain down.

Atop a giant crystal tower, bathed in red, a small girl reaches out to a wave of monsters.

Redina, standing on the arc crystal, says.

"We can do this."

-Crackle!

Hellfire rains down like thunderbolts on the waves of monsters.

"I can survive."

A little wizard was raining down disaster from the sky.
