-Bang!

A dimly lit space with the sound of ripples tearing through the air echoing here and there.

The whip breaks the speed of sound with each stroke, creating a rippling sound that tears through the air. The sound is intimidating in itself, but those who are struck are in even greater danger.

Those struck by the flesh-ripping whip can't even scream when it's that bad.

A person who has been tortured to death.

Looking at the condition of the men, some of whom she couldn't tell if they were dead or alive, Olivia saw them stretched out in the cage, Sutton already dead.

"This way."

Olivia was being led somewhere by a man dressed as an Inquisitor.

The basement of the Crusader Headquarters.

There were more people than usual in the huge interrogation room.

Olivia had been in and out a few times, and had even been nearly dragged back here by her foster parents.

But now, Olivia was here in her capacity as a special inquisitor.

"What did they all get caught for?"

At Olivia's question, one of the interrogators in the lead role clicked his tongue.

"The times are suspicious, and not only is there demonism, but strange folk witchcraft and idolatry here and there. Whether they believe in the existence of local legends, or worship unheard-of cults that are not demons at all, or......."

"Do you have a group of martialists who believe in Lagan Artorius?"

"They are the most troublesome, heresy to be sure, but......."

"So you're saying it's a hard problem to touch."

"Yes, I don't know about after the papal conclave, but you're still....... out of their hands."

As anxiety and fear spreads, a number of folk religions have sprung up, not just warrior religions and demonic religions.

Dragonism is the largest of the cults, and while it requires a quick hand, it can lead to mass civilian slaughter if you mess it up.

Not only would that put them at odds with the Empire, but it would also turn the people against the Five Great Houses.

The name of Lagan Artorius is very heavy and huge. It is said that he saved mankind and ascended to sit at the right hand of the gods, but even if it were not true, who would dare to claim it?

It was a situation that could lead to the ridiculous scenario of the Church of God becoming the enemy of humanity.

Thus, minor heresies were brought into these interrogation chambers before they could spread, demanding repentance and making the heretics vomit out their information, but not yet the martial heretics who could be seen on the streets.

Olivia found the situation hilarious.

Following the outbreak of the Demon War, the Five Great Houses of God formed an allied force of all the Houses of God called the Crusader Knights.

It was pretty good. It was a symbiotic relationship, but once they had an organization that represented their collective interests, they had a general body of believers with five times the voice, five times the power, and five times the influence.

The leader of the Crusader Knights even gained a level of influence and power comparable to that of the Pope of each of the Five Great Houses.

It was created in the name of defeating demons, but now that the demons are gone, it's not going away, even though it should.

So much so that former crusader leader Leviathan Lance even planned to establish a theocracy.

However, the reappearance of the Devil has turned the tables.

The devil didn't do something himself.

People driven mad by the terror of the demons have created a fictional faith called Dragonism, which has become a threat to the Five Great Houses.

As for the establishment of a theocratic state, the Five Great Shinto religions now have to worry about their survival in the face of the insubstantial faith of the warrior religion.

Moreover, the presence of Ellen Artorius and the new master of Alsbringer, Reinhardt, only increases the prestige of the Order rather than diminishes it.

Did you not say.

That a warrior will return.

Reinhard, the Second Coming, and Ellen Artorius, a kinswoman of the warrior, will save us.

Religion is all about fitting beliefs into reality, and those who believe in Mercenaryism will proclaim that their appearance is somehow the fulfillment of the prophecies of Mercenaryism. Mercenary religion expands.

No dogma, no denomination, no parish, no temple, no pope.

A plague will sweep the continent in the name of the fiery religion of the warrior.

The Five Great Lords.

It may end up in the hands of the crowd, not the devil.

Did the Devil foresee this when he attacked Leviathan?

If he killed Leviathan because he knew it would happen, then the Devil is something else, a genius for lack of a better word.

Even human insanity and fear are factored into the calculation.

If so, it could be that he sensed signs of a warrior religion after killing Reverie Lance, and attacked Raziern to amplify it.

A trigger for the murder of Revere Lance.

A bomb called the Primary Raziern Raid.

That's what exploded in the current demonic raid.

A few guerrilla wars later, the Five Great Houses were faced with a crisis: a revival of warrior religions.

I wonder if the devil really knew this would happen.

Olivia can't see that.

However, Olivia decided to do what she had to do.

You don't have to choose me.

If it makes you laugh, so be it.

If it makes you happy, so be it.

Honor Reinhardt.

If I had to be a monster to do it, so be it.

"This is it."

It's not a place where you can see right through the bars like you can in other places.

A massive cell blocked by a massive stone wall.

Outside, numerous magical guards and protectors prevent interference from the outside and escape from the inside.

If there are important people among the pagans, these are the cells where they are kept.

-curl!

The Inquisitor manipulated something. A stone wall opened, revealing a cell.

A mangled pagan was there, head bowed, unconscious.

"It's not fake, is it?"

This question was important to Olivia, who had already seen people trying to hang non-believers in the provinces, and priests actually joining in to create false victims.

You don't want to interrogate someone who's a hardass.

"I'm sure of it. It's not a villager, it's a priest who can use the holy power of the demons. He doesn't speak, though, and since he's a priest, he must have some special training."

From what Olivia could see, it was clear that the torture hadn't been done by conventional means. It was clear that she was quite resistant to mental magic, as well as anti-magic.

"Okay, everybody out."

"What? He's dangerous. You two are alone......."

"Do I need to say it twice?"

Olivia stared at them, and they swallowed hard.

Somehow, beneath his gentle expression, there was an eeriness that was as sharp as a knife.

An apostle of Tuan who was once a renowned saint of Eredian who abandoned her faith and returned with the Tiamata.

Going against her will could be considered an act against the will of God. Not even the Pope or the Crusaders could treat a champion who had been chosen by a holy object lightly.

"Yes, just in case......."

"You know it, so get out."

At Olivia's simple command, the stone wall doors closed and darkness fell over the stone chamber.

-Whoops

Olivia waved her hand, and the light that appeared illuminated the stone chamber.

The torture of the Inquisition is not for the faint of heart.

The torture of the priests is not in the pain, but in the restorative power they can wield.

Even if you think you're going to lose your mind, even if you think you're going to lose a limb, even if you're about to go into hemorrhagic shock.

The priests restore the body to its original state and begin the torture all over again.

That's why most of the time you're just spitting out the truth, or at least the lies, to get the Inquisitors to say what you want them to say.

A priest of a fiendish religion who never came clean.

Olivia pulled up a chair across from the shrunken, unresponsive demonist and sat down.

"Why don't you look up when you're awake?"

"......."

The other person didn't respond.

"I'm not good at torture, I'm a quack, and if I torture you, you'll die."

At Olivia's crisp but murderous words, a cracked voice rang out from the bowed heathen.

"Kill......."

The answer was simple.

Even death is not free here. It's very hard to kill yourself, even harder when you're tied up, and if you try to die, the priests will bring you back.

Torture where not even death is allowed.

That's the difference between a real inquisition and a bullshit inquisition like the one in Raziern.

"How easy it is to say something like that when you've been tortured so badly. Poor thing."

Olivia stares at the bowed heathen.

"Still, I'm a little different from the interrogators we've had so far."

In the light.

Olivia holds out her right hand in front of the bowed heathen.

-Shoooooooo





"I can wield demonic power, and I'm pretty good at it."

In Olivia's right hand, a dark, ethereal energy flowed, different from the white light in the room.

"We're on the same side."

Pagan, head held high, looks at Olivia in disbelief.

Demons and demigods have the same source of power.

Olivia felt bad for the countless arguments, heartaches, and deaths that resulted from not knowing, or not wanting to admit it.

Olivia will take advantage of it.

Olivia is a priestess of Tuan and a priestess of Kier.

So you can open a mouth that never opens unless you're an ally, and you can open it any number of times.

"Now, are you in the mood to talk?"

Olivia, who has lit up the room with the power of purity, stares at the pagan with the power of corruption all over her.

"Oh....... Lord......."

To the pagan eye, it must have looked like an image of a god.



* * *



Late at night, after a small feast enjoyed by the four of them in the middle of the night, Harriet returned to her room, washed, dried her hair, and climbed into bed.

Realizing that she couldn't hate Reinhardt more than she liked him, Herriot clung to him in desperation.

I wonder if this is good enough.

While it was true that he couldn't hate Reinhardt, it was also true that he would be the last one standing.

You know you have a deeper heart, a deeper relationship, a deeper connection to other people, and you know you're supposed to be on the periphery.

Should I get in between them and endure their misery forever?

It was fun to just chat with Reinhard, eat something, and talk. I was so happy, relaxed, and happy that I didn't even feel the depression that I was sinking into on my own.

But when he returns to his dorm room, he finds himself back in the shabbiness.

Is this right?

Is it right to have fun now, to be comfortable now, to be happy now, to build a heart now that will hurt more later?

Better to be sick than not.

I'm in a lot of pain right now and might as well be dead.

That way, it won't hurt later.

If you endure this pain now, it will one day become a scar.

After it becomes a scar, at least it won't hurt.

Maybe that's the way to go.

But tomorrow, Reinhardt will be as nonchalant as he's ever been.

It would be funny to ask Reinhardt to stop being so polite and friendly.

Among other things.

We don't know the specifics right now, but Reinhardt had a pretty deep relationship with Charlotte. I believe Reinhardt once saved Charlotte's life when she was in danger.

Ellen and Reinhardt fought for their lives together in the Darklands, and arguably spent the most time together.

In Olivia's case, she was imprisoned and threatened by her adoptive father, and Reinhardt was able to get her out. This is also a life saver.

Reinhardt had a big break with all three but himself.

But yourself?

'Something is too trivial. No matter how much I think about it.......'

Even in your own mind.

It's a shame that I keep getting pushed aside.

In all seriousness, I think I'm objectively a slacker.

"......."

Of course, it's good to have a rough patch, but Herriot wondered if the fact that he didn't have one was making a difference.

Herriot de Saint-Antoine, Grand Duchess of the Duchy of Saint-Antoine, is a feast.

It is no longer possible to say that this body of a Grand Duchess is a commoner. Reinhardt is the champion of Als.

Even how was today?

I almost cowered in front of Reinhardt like I was being stalked, even though nothing had actually happened, and I was so embarrassed I wanted to die of shame.

It's not like we had a big fight and then a big, tearful reconciliation.

This is what happens when you don't have a proper conversation.

It was ridiculous that Herriot was freaking out over something so insignificant that he ended up reconciling with Reinhardt or something.

Isn't even the event of the relationship getting back on track too much of a nagging feeling?

Dawn the next day.

"Grand Duchess Saint-Antoine, I'll need your assistance for a moment."

Until two wizards, who introduced themselves as investigators from the Imperial Ministry of Magic, knocked on his door at the crack of dawn.

Apparently, that's what I was thinking.

When two men show up at her dormitory claiming to be investigators from the Imperial Ministry of Magic, she can't help but panic.

It can't be fake. If it was, it wouldn't have gotten inside the temple in the first place.

"Send me to....... Why?"

"There was a murder in the Imperial Ministry of Magic research library last night, and we need you to be interviewed as a key witness."

"Yes....... What?!"

Homicide.

The words made her head spin, and at the same time, she felt an inexplicable sense of dread.

I couldn't help but stiffen as soon as I heard that it was a crime to do anything wrong, even if it was the retarded Grand Duchess of Saint-Thuan.

It's even a murder in an imperial palace.

Herriot was white as a sheet as he looked at the polite but high-pressure investigators.

It was early in the morning, and their classmates would be sleeping. However, it was also time for the early morning trainers to wake up.

"......, what's going on?"

For example, Reinhardt.
