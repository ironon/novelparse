            Episode 599.





It started with Rowen's death, but the Crusaders' catacombs were the culprit.

Detomorian says we'll know when we find Ashur, but we don't know what that means yet.

But this time, the destination is a national cemetery.

They have this in common.

The tombs of the saints have been robbed.

And it is possible that the remains have been reanimated as the undead.

Detomorian told me to find Ashur. Then you will know everything.

If the instructions to find Ashur meant to go to the Zodiacal National Cemetery, it ends up telling you to go to a different cemetery.

It's a scary thought.

Louise mumbles to herself.

"No way, the creators of the undead did the same thing here......?"

Louise's words made Ludwig wince.

"Well, not many people can get to the basement of the Temple of the Crusaders, but....... Do you think that's possible when it's so open here?"

An expanded national cemetery is an open space. When that happens, someone is inevitably going to see it.

"If it was a deserted night, it might be possible, and there was a wizard involved, and if we could use noise canceling and teleportation, we could do it here."

Crusader Catacombs.

And the National Cemetery.

What if the clue Dettomorian gave you hinted that the incident didn't just happen in the basement of the Crusaders?

"But if that's what happened, shouldn't it have been the same here, like the Crusaders were in a frenzy? It's not normal."

Heinrich asked.

It's a no-brainer.

It's a scene of mass grave robbing, or undeadization. Such a thing would not go unnoticed. If it happened in the National Cemetery, as it did with the Crusaders, there would be an imperial response.

But now, in the snow, the national cemetery was serene and peaceful.

It never appeared to be a place where strange and ominous events like undeadization had occurred.

"Yeah, I guess nothing happened."

As Ludwig says, it's not supposed to be this quiet at the scene of the crime.

What they have in common is a cemetery.

I couldn't figure out if there was a point to it, or if everyone was jumping on the Dettomorian bandwagon and extrapolating clues that weren't there.

"Wait......."

But in the meantime, Ellen bit her lip slightly.

"Do you get it?"

"Well, we've been waiting in line."

"Joule?"

"Yes."

Ellen looks at Louise.

"You know, the one where you waited in line to get in here. Remember?"

"...... did, apparently."

"Why are we in line?"

"......Why are you waiting in line?"

Ellen narrowed her eyes at Louise's question.

"Technically, it wasn't the line, it was the identity."

Louise nodded in agreement.

It was a flash in the pan, but that was a while ago.

"We didn't restrict access to visitors based on their status."

Among the visitors were nobles, soldiers, and people who appeared to be poor.

Soon, we were not restricting access to visitors based on their status.

"We didn't have a lot of visitors, but everyone was able to get inside, which means that anyone can get into this national cemetery."

"I suppose."

"Why are we doing identity verification in a place where anyone can walk in?"

If you're not restricting access, why are you checking?

"......Maybe to track down criminals. There's bound to be a lot of John Doe's. But....... I don't know if this is the place for a crime to happen......."

Crime only happens in places where it is likely to happen.

What kind of crime could possibly occur in a place where there are only cemeteries everywhere, and why would you need to check the identity of every single person entering?

None of the four know how access to the original national cemetery works.

But something.

That's weird.

"I need to see my manager."

We still don't know what happened.

But Ellen thinks differently than Heinrich.

I don't think Detomorian was talking nonsense. So it means something.

There's got to be something we can figure out here.

Ellen thinks so.



* * *



Meeting the director of the Huangdao National Cemetery wasn't too difficult.

You can ask the crusader leader to jump out in front of the Crusader High Hall, but the Ecliptic National Cemetery is easier.

When Ellen called from the National Cemetery, the superintendent ushered everyone into the director's office as if they were on fire.

"Whoa......."

When Heinrich enters the room and sees her frozen hands and the tip of her frozen nose, Louise mumbles to herself.

"Gosh....... That was cold."

"Oh, no, my sister....... It's okay."

Louise couldn't help but feel sorry for herself, realizing that she'd let a problem that should have been of concern to her go unnoticed because it didn't affect her.

Of course, Heinrich had just run a bit of a fever, but his days of being a stern man were behind him, so he put on an overly good front.

"Ma, it's an honor to meet you!"

"Hello."

When the superintendent of the National Cemetery saw Ellen, he was overwhelmed.

This is a common and typical reaction. Just as the guards at the gate did.

Although this attitude sometimes sends chills down her spine, Ellen has no choice but to get used to it.

The four of us sat in silence while the manager bustled around and sipped tea.

I don't know what I'm here for.

I couldn't tell if she was just surprised to see Ellen or if she had some sort of ulterior motive.

But if the location was relevant to the case, the warden must know something.

Watching the warden bustle about preparing a total of five cups of tea, including her own, Ellen took a sip of her tea out of courtesy.

Ellen doesn't know much about cars.

But I could see the joy and sincerity in his face. It was as if he was facing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

I said.

I don't deserve to be treated like this.

Fighting to keep the thought out of her head, Ellen speaks up.

"It's not anything else, I was in line when I came in here."

"Oh, no. I'm sorry to hear you were in a hurry. If you had told the guards, you could have come straight in......."

"No, that's not what I meant."

Ellen realized that if she said the wrong thing, the middle-aged man in front of her might have a heart attack.

If you take it that way, it's ridiculous.

A warrior who came to me grumpy because he couldn't get a new one. Ellen had not the slightest idea.

"I thought you were verifying your identity."

"Yes, it is."

"Is there anyone who can't get into the national cemetery?"

"What? Ah......."

The superintendent scratched his head at Ellen's question.

Apologetically.

"We are restricting access to people whose residence is unknown or whose identity is not registered."

They're not the only ones.

However, the reality of the ecliptic is that there are more than enough of them now.

"You mean the refugees, right?"

"Well, technically, that would be the case....... No, of course, not all refugees are off limits. If you have a clear identity and a clear place of residence......."

But for refugees living in shacks, there was no way they could provide proper identification.

It would have meant that neither of them could enter the national cemetery.

It's not identity or wealth that matters.

"You mean only those who can be tracked, right?"

"For example, ......."

If the person is traceable, they are allowed in; if not, they are denied access.

The reason is probably simple.

Crime.

Refugees may enter national cemeteries and commit crimes.

Hiding out in a building somewhere in a cemetery to escape the cold, sleeping, or stealing. It's not so strange if you have controlled access.

Ellen's brow furrowed as she tried to figure out what to ask next.

"Yo, warrior. Of course refugees have a right to be memorialized, they're poor people, and I don't blame them."

At the mention of refugee restrictions, the warrior suddenly frowns and starts to think.

Seeing the look on her face, the warden could only assume that Ellen had come to visit because she felt it was unjust to keep the refugees out.

"Yes, I suppose so."

Of course, Ellen wasn't here to ask or argue, so she just replied dryly.

"Of course, not so long ago, the national cemetery was completely open. Anyone could come in, including refugees, yes, obviously......."

"Is that ......?"

Ellen and the other three couldn't help but react to the janitor's excuses.

"Does this mean that access control has changed?"

At her question, the superintendent nodded, not knowing who she was, for now.

"Yeah, sure. I mean, it's an inconvenience to the mourners, so why should we do it, and we haven't had any problems so far......."

"Anyone could come in, and the fact that they don't these days means......."

"Did something happen?"

"Something worse than theft has happened....... I can't help it......."

"What happened?"

The superintendent breaks out in a cold sweat, sounding regretful, but like he had no choice.

"......Someone has vandalized a cemetery."

In a word.

All four faces hardened simultaneously.



* * *



Someone among the mourners vandalized the cemetery.

If you heard that story without knowing anything about it, you'd think there was someone out there who did just that.

But all the same, I couldn't help but feel that it was too much of a coincidence.

Graveyard Steal.

Cemetery desecration.

It's a little too similar.

"How did you deface it?"

Ellen's expression grew more serious, and the superintendent couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.

"It looks like someone was trying to rob a cemetery....... or something like that. It looks like they were unsuccessful in their digging, but it's a big deal that there was an attempt at all......."

"Did you catch the culprit?"

"We didn't have any restrictions on access at the time, so......."

We found evidence of an attempted theft. However, because the cemetery was open at the time, we were unable to catch the culprit.

The National Cemetery Service was horrified that it happened, and hasn't let anyone in since.

"Are you sure the steal failed?"

"What? The lawn was ruined, but that was it....... I'm guessing it was probably because it was cold and the ground was frozen and the shovel wouldn't go in."

It was a bit of a coincidence, but it wasn't out of the realm of possibility that someone else had done it.

"Suppose grave robbers come in and dig up the grave in the first place....... Is there anything they can take?"

Louise focuses on something more intuitive.

"I don't know what they know to do that, but....... We don't know that either."

"What do you mean you don't know?"

It is very important to know if there are valuable treasures buried in the tomb.

If there is, it's probably just a bunch of grave robbers, and if there isn't, it's a little more suspicious.

After a moment of excitement at the sudden appearance of the warrior, his blood ran dry at the thought of being interrogated every minute.

"Lately, we've been burying coffins sent to us from Allied garrisons according to established procedures. Since the funerals come from the Allied side, we don't know....... We don't know if any of the burial goods(副葬品) are valuable."

"Oh....... I see."

At the warden's words, Louise nodded slowly in agreement.

"Booty......?"

Louise answers Ludwig's unintelligible question.

"I'm talking about the stuff they bury with the body. Of course, when a high ranking nobleman dies, there's a lot of stuff that's worth a lot of money, and that's what grave robbers are looking for."

"Oh....... I see."

If the superintendent is correct, grave robbers have recently entered the national cemetery.

We don't know if they were trying to scavenge or something else, but the attempt failed.

After confirming this, the ranger station has since allowed only those who have proven their identity to enter.

It's entirely possible that there's treasure in the coffin, so having a grave robber isn't that strange.

What could have been. What didn't happen.

Too much of a good thing, though.

Ellen stares at the superintendent.

You feel like you're going to catch something, but you still don't.

"Date."

That's why Ellen asks one last question.

"What was the date of the burglary?"

"Oh, I'll get to that in a minute."

The director goes to his desk and starts furiously shuffling through something.

Unlike the ambiguous attitude of the Crusader Knights, he feared and respected Ellen, and wanted to help her in any way he could.

It's pretty clear that they're not involved in the case at all, and they're not trying to hide anything.

Of course, even I might be faking it.

The superintendent soon had an answer.

"To....... We don't know if this is the day of the incident; with such a large site and limited manpower, it could have happened days ago......."

"Okay, when?"

"I found it on the evening of December 3rd."

At that, Ellen looks at Louise.

"It's that day."

"Yes."

December 3.

It was the day of the Tomb of the Saints robbery.

Beyond coincidence, the suspicions have now reached a level where they cannot be coincidental.
