The alignment process wasn't too complicated.

The deputies applauded us in welcome, and we knelt before the emperor to listen to his speech.

I don't know if it was prepared or off the cuff, but it was all a facade.

It's good to see the quality of people we've trained at the Temple, the institution that prepares the future of the Empire, and I hope they will continue to lead the Empire in the future.

It's like the principal's discipline speech.

The emperor stood us up and shook our hands once to say, "Keep up the good work," and of course, we got to see the obvious.

-to move forward.

-Cough, cough! This is the honor of a lifetime, Emperor!

-Umm, well.

There were crybabies.

No, that was the majority of the reaction, and rightly so.

-to move forward.

-This honor and glory, I will engrave on my soul and engage in empire for the rest of my life!

-Good.

Even the one who looks like he's got something to say.

Anyway, they were all basking in their glory. That's the normal reaction.

"Go forth."

"Yes."

Ellen nods once, as if shaking hands with the emperor and answering to a teacher.

"Go forth."

"Thank you."

I thought about trying to sound as glorious as possible, but I didn't think it was an honor anyway, so I kept it simple.

My reaction and Ellen's was the strangest axis.

The Emperor was informed that Radia Schmidt was not present, but he didn't bother to point it out.

After that, a luncheon with the emperor was scheduled.

At the luncheon, the Temple students and the Emperor were seated at a long table.

Like our last meal at the Palace of Spring, we started with appetizers, and the food came out plate by plate, course by course.

-Omnom

"?"

Ellen took a bite, whimpered, and stared at her plate.

What is.

Why is this the only one.

I feel like this.

For Ellen, who gets impatient when it comes to food, a course meal is a meal where the wait is too long. She likes to order everything, eat it all, and then order more.

When a plate of food is served, they gobble it up and then sit back, and when a plate of food is served, they gobble it up and then sit back and stare at their plate.

Come to think of it, did you mumble something about being hungry earlier?

Naturally, the emperor was eating while watching the students.

The emperor whispered a few words to the maid who was serving the meal.

......Since then, Ellen's share has been three servings.

I think he saw me eating and gave me a secret instruction. He might be embarrassed if I told him.

-Omnomnomnom

The meal was hearty enough that Ellen could eat in time with the others.

Of course, Ellen didn't question the sudden increase in volume.

Just eating it.

"Why?"

I glared at her, and she shook her head.

"I, sometimes....... that you're a little....... Yeah."

"What?"

"Never mind."

I'm not ashamed to admit it.

His appetite was so voracious that he was favored by the emperor.

I know it's nothing to be ashamed of, but I'm ashamed of me!

Everyone was nervous to be in front of the emperor, and they looked at Ellen, who was eating a lot, and at me, who was giving them pints, as if to say, "Oh, my God, you're so funny.

No, I'm the weirder one, right?



* * *



After the luncheon, we took a quick tour of the Central Palace Tetra.

We didn't make it to the Emperor's bedroom, but we did get a full tour, including the ballroom, the guards' quarters, and the galleries. I expected the tour to end with an informal luncheon, but since it was an official event, the Emperor seemed to have quite a bit of time on his hands.

Everyone was stiff and nervous, waiting for the emperor to speak to them, but he didn't speak to me or Ellen.

It didn't take long to realize why.

When all was said and done, the students, including us, were being escorted out by the guards.

"You guys come here."

Xavier Tana, dressed in the uniform of Shanapelle, called out to me and Ellen.

"Do you remember me?"

"Yes, Mr. Chanapelle."

Ellen remembered Saviolin Tana's face, too, because she'd seen it when she was a first-year dorm warden, though she'd never met her.

"Very well, you two have been summoned separately by the Emperor, follow me."

The other students left, and Ellen and I headed off somewhere, led by Saviolin Tana.

-Smart

"Your Majesty, I have brought them to you."

-Come in.

"Yes."

Saviolin Tana comes out and sees Ellen.

"I trust it to take care of itself."

"Yes."

-nod

Knowing my rebellious side, Saviolin Tana was worried about me, even though she didn't know Ellen.

I'm not going to walk out in front of the emperor saying I'm crazy.

Saviolin Tana opened the door and was greeted by high ceilings and books lining the walls.

At a wooden table set by the window, the emperor sat in a backlit chair.

The Emperor's office, or study.

That seemed to be the place to go.

On the armchair next to him lay the cloak, scepter, and crown he had been wearing. They'd be cumbersome, and he wouldn't wear them unless he was on official business.

Casual clothes that are classy but not fancy.

When Neliod de Gradias took off his cloak, scepter, and crown, he looked like a scholar.

-Dalcock

"Come closer. You don't have to be on your knees."

Ellen and I followed his instructions and took a few steps in front of the Emperor.

The Emperor looks at me and Ellen.

"You two, how much do you know about each other?"

It's a silly question, but I know what it means.

Ellen is hiding the fact that she is Artorius' sister.

I'm also hiding the fact that I'm the owner of Tiamata.

We're asking each other if we know it. If they don't, it's because they want to keep our secret.

"There's a lot we don't know, but we know enough to know each other."

Before I could say anything, Ellen spoke up.

There's a lot we don't know, but we know enough.

I felt like I was digging my heels into my chest for nothing.

"That makes it easier to talk to you, good."

The Emperor stares at us in silence.

"As Emperor of the Empire, it is an honor to meet the Champion of Tuan and the Apostle of Mensis."

The emperor is the first to do so, and we are puzzled. The Emperor rises from his seat and stares out the window.

"The gods don't choose champions for nothing."

We don't know if he is a follower of the Five Great Houses or not.

But since we can't deny the existence of God, he must be talking about divine providence itself.

"Champions have always had a role to play, and there are things in the world that need them, which is why there are holy relics and their champions."

"......."

"......."

"Ellen Artorius."

"Yes."

"Alsbringer is held by the Empire."

Alsbringer, the sword of the war god Als, belongs to Ellen's brother.

"I thought so."

Ellen just nodded, not really surprised.

"If Alsbringer chooses a champion, the world will have three of the five gods' artifacts."

Three holy relics have entered the world. Two have already chosen champions, and Alsbringer's whereabouts are certain.

"Even during the Demon War, there were only two holy items in the world: the Alsbringer and the Rament, which belonged to Lagan Artorius. And only the Alsbringer was actually used."

The emperor just stares out the window.

"But what do you think this phenomenon of having one more holy object now that the Demon War is over is telling us?"

"Does this mean that more dangerous things are going to happen?"

"......maybe."

To the Emperor's words, Ellen replied.

The gods don't leave holy objects lying around in the world.

Even in the greatest crisis of humanity, the Demon War, there were only two holy objects, and now there is one more.

The emperor seemed to interpret it as a red flag for the fate of humanity.

But that's a misconception.

The Five Great Gods are not gods for humans. It seems clear that even the emperor cannot escape such preconceptions.

The Emperor turns and looks at me and Ellen.

"I'm sure you're aware of the rumors that have been swirling around the ecliptic lately."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"Yes."

"Nearly two dozen elite paladins, including the former leader of the Crusader Legion, Revere Lance, were slain by an unidentified group of demons. All of them were war heroes who served with distinction in the Demon War."

It's no secret, but it's refreshing to hear it from the mouth of an imperial emperor.

As the person who did it.

"It would be easy to assume that this is the work of simple demonic remnants, but the Imperials have the worst in mind."

"......."

"Maybe the devil isn't dead, or maybe he has a successor."

Ellen swallowed nervously at the words.

Demon.

For Ellen, the names are inseparable.

As the younger sister of a warrior and even more gifted than Ragan Artorius, Ellen must have always envisioned herself being forced to become a warrior.

"You are very valuable people, with holy relics. But you are also young."

They are the buds that have the qualities to become warriors, but are not yet able to become warriors.

"But even later, are you ready to fight against the devil?"

At the Emperor's question, I and Ellen were silent.

I don't think you can say no.

But Ellen said she didn't want to live that life if she could save the world with her life.

I told myself I wouldn't make the same choices as my brother.

But at the same time, I risked my life to stop innocent people from dying in the Darklands.

Ellen is not the same Ellen she was at the beginning of the semester.

"If the devil's desire is the destruction of humanity, if his goal is to destroy everything I love......."

Ellen says calmly.

"Yes. I'm going to fight the devil."

Unlike the original, Ellen has made a lot of precious things.

Even without that, Ellen still risked her life for the world, but it meant something very different now.

If the devil's purpose is to destroy all of humanity, I'll kill him.

Ellen says

The Emperor sees me this time.

"Me neither."

You're not slaying the devil.

I am prepared to fight for it, and I am fighting for it now. The Emperor looked back and forth between Ellen and I, who had both said the same thing, albeit with different meanings, and nodded with a stony expression.

"Thank you."

Coming from the mouth of an emperor, these words of gratitude were bound to catch me off guard to some extent.

"From now on, the Empire promises you its utmost protection and cooperation."

To the Emperor, we are a weapon to defeat the Demon. Therefore, for as long as it takes for us to become strong, we promise you not only our protection as Temple students, but also unlimited cooperation at the Imperial level.

Unaware that the object of their cooperation is the demon they so desperately want to find.

"And Reinhardt."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

The emperor's eyes showed a slightly different emotion than before.

If you've been discussing the future of the Empire and humanity, your eyes are a little more emotional.

"Thank you for saving my daughter."

Something that should be called paternalism.

"......?"

Naturally, Ellen didn't know what this meant, so she scratched her head.



* * *



After exchanging such words with the Emperor, Ellen and I were escorted out of the palace by the guards.

The emperor let Ellen go first, then said.

"Soon, there may be something you need to do for Charlotte.

'......Yes.'

"I'm not sure what that is yet, but can you do that for me?

The answer was obvious.

"Yes.

'......Thanks. Reinhardt.'

There was something deeply resonant in the emperor's pure gratitude that I hadn't expected.

What to do for Charlotte.

We don't know what it is.

But if it's for Charlotte's sake, it will have to be done.

Of course, that's an afterthought, and the emperor had a different agenda.

As the bearers of the holy artifact, the Emperor deemed my safety and that of Ellen Artorius to be of the utmost importance to the Empire in the face of the possible return of the Devil.

Later, in exchange for promising to risk his life in the fight against the Demon, he received nearly unlimited support from the Empire.

Ellen and I put our respective items in our arms.

It was an imperial coat of arms, the same one I had briefly received from Charlotte.

With this, the Emperor explained, we are no longer merely students of the Temple Royal class, but have been granted immense powers that surpass even the greatest nobles.

I was told that I would be treated like royalty everywhere, and if the situation was serious enough, troops could be called in.

To put it simply.

Now we're talking about a free pass to the Warp Gate.

Of course, neither I nor Ellen realized that right now.

"Explain to me what's going on."

Ellen, alone with the man, asked bluntly.

I had no choice but to explain the situation to Ellen.

From what happened at the Palace of Spring, to Charlotte's outbursts, to the fight at the Palace of Spring with Savior Tana.

Ellen heard the date, remembered the few days I hadn't returned to the Temple, and seemed to recognize when it was.

"You said you've never been to the palace."

"......Sorry."

"You lied again."

Now, on the subject of not having been to the palace today, while talking to the Emperor, it was revealed that he had been to the palace and even saved Charlotte's life.

"That's because it's....... I don't want anyone to hear about it......."

"......."

"Not that you shouldn't hear it, but....... Well, there was someone else."

Ellen shook her head.

"Yeah, well, it's not your problem, it's Charlotte's problem, and for you to feel free to tell me that....... I'm talking about an imperial secret, and it must be hard to tell."

Ellen nodded in understanding. It wasn't something I could decide to tell anyone. Ellen seemed to be thinking about it.

You pause, wondering whether to say something, then look up.

"Can I be sad?"

"......?"

"I shouldn't be sad about this, I'm sad."

"That's, that's....... It's your mind......."

I'm guessing you're just trying to get permission to be sad.

"Well, I feel bad for you."

Ellen's mouth started to water as she said that.

"I'm sorry....... Sorry......."

"You always say you're sorry."

Ellen grumbles and kicks a rolling stone in vain.

"I want to hear what else you have to say."

What the other words were, Ellen didn't say. As if she was being distracted, Ellen turned her head away.

He stares at the main entrance to the Imperial Palace of Emperatos behind him, and then holds out the imperial crest he received from the Emperor.

"You said we're treated like royalty now, right?"

"Not really royalty, but hey....... You did say that, didn't you?"

"So, can we just go in there?"

Ellen shakes her head.

"Well......? Why not?"

Treating people like royalty is not something an emperor would do.

The Emperor sees us as weapons to fight the Demon in the future. Since we are champions who have chosen to dedicate our lives to the fight against the Demon, we will be given the utmost protection and treatment until we are strong enough.

Ellen stares blankly at the entrance to the palace.

I'm not sure why you'd want to know that.

"Let's go back."

Ellen walks briskly.

Not on the temple side.

"You want to use a gate?"

"Yeah, you can use it."

Ellen was heading toward the warp gate.

I wasn't the only one who thought of it as a warp gate high pass ticket.

In a way, being treated like royalty means that the thing you're going to use most often is warp gate priority.

It doesn't seem like a big deal, but it felt like a huge entitlement to me.

No.

Even real royalty, Charlotte, rode a horse-drawn train in the Yellow Peril.

I don't like how we're using warp gates willy-nilly.

Isn't that annoying?

Of course, even as I did so, I followed Ellen to the warp gate at a brisk pace.

If it's a pain in the ass and it works, I'll use it.

I got a big pat on the back for that attitude.
