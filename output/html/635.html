The Archduke wants to stop by Edina.

The Senate's response was, "You're on your own.

Lucinil suggested that we limit Edina to only one Archduke, just in case, and I agreed, as did Herriot.

We don't know if the Archduke will actually be a clue, but it would be a shame if he wasn't.

If we work together, we might come up with something.

So a few days later.

"Dad!"

-Wrong!

I watched from afar as Herriot ran to the Archduke and embraced him fiercely.

Time makes a lot of difference.

When did the daughter who used to annoy her father become that?

Like the time you had to sneak off to Arnaria and return with a heavy conversation.

Now that the Archduke was on her side, Herriot would be able to see the family she'd always wanted to see.

It wasn't a tearful reunion.

Herriot wasn't crying, he was giddy with excitement, and the Archduke was beaming.

The father and daughter, who had been clinging to each other like they would never be separated, break the embrace, and the Archduke looks at me.

"Thank you. Reinhard."

"I'll thank you."

Seeing the Archduke's gratitude tickled the back of my head.

I don't think that's the way to say thank you.

Should I be thanked for taking the obvious for granted?

It feels weird to realize that just as there is hate for being a demon, there is also favor and gratitude for being a demon.

The Archduke stands at the gates of the castle, in the front yard, looking out over the landscape of Edina down the hill.

Now that the Archduke knows where it is, he can stop by whenever he wants.

"Yeah....... If it were an island....... If it were an island, it would be like this......."

The Archduke stared down at the peaceful seaside town of Razak, and somehow, he seemed to feel a strange sense of intensity.

"My God, I can't believe this is still around......."

Due to the great barrier of the ocean, even flying monsters from the continents can't reach it.

The Edina Archipelago itself is a tourist destination, so we had great weather, clear skies, and crystal clear waters.

It's a beautiful scene.

And that's not all.

"I can't believe this is what it looks like......."

From a distance, you can still see the demons and humans living together.

Some humans still fear demons. But there are also humans who talk to demons freely.

The Archduke's eyes widened at the sight of them living together.

It's like you want to properly regret the moments in your life when you didn't know this was possible.

Like trying to think about how pointless the Demon War was, instead of avoiding it.

"We came here early on in the gate crisis and focused on pacifying the area, so there wasn't a lot of damage."

The moment the Gate debacle broke.

I went straight to Edina and rescued Airi.

And destroyed all the warp gates in the archipelago.

"Yes, and after that, we set up a base on the continent, and we evacuated people and demons to it, and we've been doing that ever since."

Herriot looked at the Archduke and began to explain what we've been doing here since the Gate incident.

I'm going to tell you everything I couldn't tell you the last time we met, because there's no reason to keep secrets now.

Herriot was more excited than ever.

You've done something.

I tried to do what I could.

That's how I was able to create this world.

The Archduke looks down at his daughter, who is talking excitedly.

With a faint smile.

Not just what you've done, but what others have done.

How Olivia Ranze, who is notoriously difficult to get along with, helped people.

How much succubi are really loved by people.

How Charlotte is now stabilizing a confused Edina.

He talks incessantly, as if he wants to tell you all about what he's done, as well as what everyone else has done.

It was weird.

It's supposed to be the Archduke who's impressed, but somehow I felt like I was swooning at the sight of Herriot.

Herriot loves this country a lot.

You're proud of yourself.

It made me feel weird to see how much she cared about people and how proud she was of them.

I wonder if the Archduke felt the same way.

The Archduke puts his hand on his daughter's head, who can't stop talking.

"It's like old times."

"......Everyday? Suddenly?"

Harriet shakes her head, as if the past has anything to do with this.

"You were greedy for praise."

"Go, why are you suddenly talking about......."

Herriot glances in my direction with a wide grin on his face.

"When he knew how to do something, he'd demonstrate it, and he'd look up at her like he does now."

"......He was, wasn't he?"

There are few people in Arnaria, and Herriot was a genius, so he must have known how to use magic from a young age.

I choked up as I imagined Herriot as a child, eagerly poring over spellbooks to earn the praise of his dad, mom, or siblings.

It's cute to think about.

"It wasn't just magic, he'd brag about anything he'd learned, and once or twice he'd say he'd memorized a poem or a novel."

It's natural for children to want to be praised by their parents.

In that sense, it's hard not to love a daughter who brags about how hard she studied, if nothing else. She was a genius, even, and she would have been told she was great.

But at the end of the day, a kid is a kid.

"When our youngest was....... when you were so young......."

The Archduke looks down the hill and says.

"Now you're bragging about how many people you've saved......."

The kid who brought in a perfect score is now a grown man, bragging about how many lives he's saved.

By now, the Archduke's eyes were red.

"Oh, Dad......?"

With that look in his eyes, the Archduke slipped his arm under Herriot's armpit and lifted him up.

The Archduke speaks as if he were addressing a child, but with his daughter, who is no longer a child.

She was smart, inconsiderate, and just plain arrogant.

Not your smarts, intelligence, and abilities.

Watching them take pride in the fact that they saved someone's life. Watching them be proud of it.

What parent wouldn't be thrilled?

"Great. My daughter."

It's like when Herriot was a kid.

However, the weight is not the same as it was when he was younger.

It's probably the highest compliment a parent can give, and the best way to say thank you.

Herriot's eyes burned bright red as he watched the Archduke's eyes burn bright red.

"Oh, Daddy....... Me....... did well, didn't we?"

"Yeah, good job."

"I....... I worked hard. A lot....... with Reinhardt....... I tried hard. I mean, I can't be good at everything, but I tried my best. I tried to help people....... I couldn't save them all. It was hard. It was painful. But I did....... Hmph! Well, still....... Still......."

After crying, Herriot eventually breaks down.

"Still....... That's good enough for....... I did good, didn't I?"

When we talk about the people we saved, we can't help but think about the people we didn't save.

"Sure, sure."

"Black...... Hmph! Black! Hmph! Hmph! Hmph! Hmph!"

The Archduke gingerly picked up his youngest daughter, who was feverish.

It ended up being a tearful reunion.



* * *



"...... sold."

Her eyes puffy and swollen, Harriet wore her bangs down and her face flushed.

"Nguyen, go for a walk with your dad."

"Ugh, huh......? Gee, what are you talking about?"

"Then you're Ngozi, aren't you? Forget it, go cry yourself to sleep and come back, the Grand Duke doesn't have much time."

"Lee, Lee, really!"

The Archduke is here on short notice as the Allies are advancing.

In reality, the Archduke has a lot of work to do, and he's practically gone AWOL.

I have to go back soon, so I'll have to talk about it when I have time.

Herriot tugged on the Archduke's hand and started down the hill, warning him to be prepared when he returned.

A daughter holding her dad's hand for a walk.

You're doing something you can't do without.

The Archduke smiled and followed Herriot's lead.

"I can't wait to see all these pictures in my lifetime. Ugh."

I don't know when she arrived, or if she was watching from afar, but when the Archduke and Herriot disappeared, Olivia Ranze was suddenly beside me.

Olivia made a gagging sound, as if she were feeling nauseous.

"Whatever, it looks good."

"Coming from an orphanage, I didn't have a father, and the father I did have was a whipping boy, so I couldn't relate to him at all."

"......was beaten with a whip?"

Was that really that bad?

"I'm just saying, it wasn't that bad, but I'd rather have been whipped."

No, why does this guy lie, even when he's lying?

But I don't know what Olivia means by that.

Herriot's pursuit of magic was ultimately self-directed, not because his parents forced him to, but because he liked to be praised.

Olivia has lived a forced life.

I wouldn't have gotten any compliments.

No matter what you've accomplished, you've always been told you're not good enough.

After a life of near-brainwashing, Olivia is a hollow person.

Olivia continues to stare at the backs of Harriet and the Archduke.

It was the kind of look you get when you're trying to imagine something you don't have.

"I didn't think so, but I must be a twisted person."

I don't know what the hell I was thinking, and Olivia looked at me and smirked.

"It was a real twist that you said ...... as if you knew that now."

"What?"

"So it's good."

"Hmm. That's it."

Olivia crosses her arms and looks out over the landscape of Razak.

"Actually me, I'm so scared these days."

I know what you're afraid of without you having to tell me.

"It's not too late to say, 'Hey, maybe we shouldn't be doing this, maybe we shouldn't be doing this....... too late, right?"

"......Yes."

Before I had it in my hands, I might have been able to.

But there are some things that are already in your grasp.

It doesn't fall back into place when we let go.

It will fall to the floor and shatter.



* * *



The phrase "breakthrough" refers to a march that pushes through a large forest.

But can the Allied advance really be described as a crushing one?

The Allies are certainly marching hard, but they're not fighting anything.

Each military commander knew that an unknown and powerful force was fighting them, and that the Empire was using something sinister. It was bound to spread.

A power you can't reveal to anyone.

Evil power.

And powerful.

People naturally think of it.

The empire has played into the hands of the devil.

People naturally associate with things that are in an imaginary category.

People don't think about demons when they're helping the march, and then they think about them when they're not actually in the vanguard.

This is because the devil in people's imaginations is a very scary thing.

In reality, the devil and his army are more powerful than people imagine, and that's what people think.

The rumors that are being spread in fear are unfounded.

How the devil took the hand of the empire.

Why the devil is helping the empire.

Why the empire played into the hands of the devil.

Where we can't imagine it, we fill in the blanks with delusions that there is some basis for it that we don't know about, and then we just imagine it.

The devil may be in the details.

What will the demon take in return for helping the humans.

People were trying to keep their mouths shut because the mere mention of unfounded rumors could cause chaos, but secretly, the sparks of confusion and anxiety were being ignited in everyone's minds.

After all, the Allies weren't going to be fighting for long, so their heads were busy, not their bodies.

None of this is certain.

And so it was, May.

The Allies were moving in one direction, having canceled all other routes to the big cities.

Regeln Capital, Diane.

We're not done with the other big cities.

However, the Allies move straight to the location of the final battle.

"I can't believe Rosenthal was able to do this with just emoji....... That's amazing."

Bertus read Immortal's battle report in a daze.

The port city of Rosentine.

With the neighboring metropolises in close proximity, there were effectively three metropolises attached to each other, so if you entered Rosentine's territory, you would have to attack all three cities simultaneously.

Since each gate is progressively more dangerous than the last, making this the last point of attack could have led to the gate situation not being finished.

In other words, it's harder to capture than the capital.

In effect, you can't just take out one city, you have to take out all three at once.

Therefore, Immortal decided to target the Rosentine neighborhood before it became uncontrollably dangerous, and Immortal alone succeeded in pacifying the area.

"But about 8% of the immortals are broken, and now it looks like it's going to be impossible to use them to take over a large city."

"So you're saying that from now on we can't just trust immortals."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

Titans, and other Allied forces.

It destroyed all three large cities near Rosenthal, where it was expected to be the hardest hit.

The Allies now advance on the Regeln capital of Diane.

There are three large cities on the route.

The remaining small and medium-sized cities will be handled by Immortals during the march.

The Allies only need to capture those three cities and the gate crisis is over.

Three battles remain.

The end is in sight.

We can stem this inexorable tide of destruction.

Immortals can't stay hidden forever.

A major battle will soon begin, and Immortals will have to fight alongside the Allies.
