"Something must be going on with you."

At Radia's question, Eleris nodded.

Radia wasn't at the meeting, but she knew from the look on Eleris' face that something was up.

"Yes, I have something important to do, and it's likely to be dangerous."

Elyse lives a tranquil life in a secluded snowy castle, but she's part of the forces that are tearing the world apart. It's only natural that she'd get involved in something dangerous. As she prepares to leave, Radia watches her go.

"I'm going to be gone for a few days, I have plenty of food, but can you take care of yourself?"

"What? Oh....... Sure. Never mind me."

Radia felt a pang of wistfulness at the way Eleris worried that she would be left behind if she went off to do something dangerous.

When she said she was going to do something dangerous, she just looked like she was going for a walk. When she said she was going to get groceries, she looked no different than when she left the house.

"Bye then."

"Oh, yeah......."

Radia could only nod at Eleris's brief greeting.

Elise leaves the room.

She's not sure what he's up to, but Radia stares after him.

Something.

I wanted to say something.

"......be safe."

"......?"

The words from behind her startled Eleris, and she turned to look at Radia.

Hope you're okay.

Simple words, but not the kind of words that would be exchanged between Radia and Elise right now. It meant that Radia had opened up to Elise, and it meant that she cared.

"Okay, I'll be back in one piece."

Eleris smiled faintly and greeted Radia once more.

Radia Schmidt stared at the door through which Elise had exited.

What it would be like to be a real family with Elise.

Blood-bound kin.

Would it make me feel more warm and fuzzy than I already do?

When Elise returns, Radia Schmidt wants to seriously ask her about joining her family.

Radia had kind of figured out that Elise would reject it.

Sunday, early morning.

Herriot and I headed to the palace.

I don't know how the council meeting will go, or what judgment the Black Order will make.

It would be best if our forces could capture the wizards of Cantus Magna, but if the Imperials succeed in capturing them, we must set up a situation where I can interrogate them.

The worst that can happen is that Cantus Magna is wiped out or you lose them.

Herriot was ready, too, with a scrollbook strapped to his back. She seemed to have prepared a lot of things.

It's just me and Heriot, anyway, and the Imperials are the ones doing the actual work. Bertus is only bringing me along for the achievement, and Herriot isn't much different.

By the time we get to the point where we have to act, something has already happened that is irreversible.

There's no departure speech or anything.

The Empire brings its best and brightest to the palace as quickly as possible, and we secure Ritchie's tomb while searching for Lothar Dwyn, who is likely headed there.

Given that a murder took place inside the palace and he escaped unharmed, Lothar Dwyn is a priority felon to catch.

so it doesn't matter if Dwin isn't there. We just need to make sure that there really is an Akrich in the rumored tomb.

If you can't find Lothar Dwyn in Richie's tomb, you'll just have to track him down another way.

The Empire seemed to be thinking about whether or not Lothar Dwyn was related to the Devil.

Garden in front of the Tetra of the Imperial Palace.

Not surprisingly, Emperor Bertus was not present.

In charge of the site was Saviolin Tana, the director of Chanapelle.

And about thirty knights of Shanapelle. And about thirty wizards from the Imperial Mage Corps.

Scotra Kelton, who we saw last time we were in Lazierne, was also there.

These are all people who have reached the pinnacle of superhumanity.

Saviolin Tana comes out and sees Herriot.

"Both, don't overdo it."

As if they had been warned, the mages and knights begin walking with me and Herriot in the center. We travel through the warp gate, then use mass teleportation in the Darklands to get to the scene immediately.

Saviolin Tana leads the troops from the front.

Things could go badly.

Everything will be fine.

It should all work out.

Nervously, Harriet grabbed my hand.

"You......."

But instead of grabbing my hand because she's scared herself, Harriet looks up at me in confusion.

No wonder.

The sweat was coming more from my side.

Herriot grabbed my hand in fear, then squeezed it harder when he realized I was more nervous.

Like he's not okay himself, but he wants to help me somehow.



* * *



That time.

"Ready?"

"Yes."

Ellen and Charlotte were outside the temple.

It was now full spring, but they were dressed very thickly.

This outfit makes sense because we're going to the poles.

They were headed to High Epirus today.

Charlotte was at the palace, so she knew about yesterday's revelations and what they were trying to do to the empire. And that Reinhardt was headed to Richie's tomb.

We don't know anything about Reinhardt yet.

The suspicion, after all, is small. All we know is that Reinhardt visited Elena's shop with a girl from Temple.

Therefore, Charlotte took no action.

You won't be sure of anything until you're sure of something.

"Something bad is happening."

"Is this about the incident yesterday?"

"Yes."

From an imperial murder to an elite force heading to Richie's tomb, and Reinhardt and Herriot de Saint-Ouen accompanying them.

Charlotte didn't tell Ellen about it.

"We do our job. Because in some cases, what we do might be more important than what they do."

"......."

Ellen and Charlotte's move could make or break an empire.

In either case, I hope this is completely unimportant.

"I'll go see if Ephex has the statue you're talking about, and we'll think about it later."

"Yes."

All of the wizards who were capable of using teleportation were gone now. And Charlotte had no intention of taking anyone other than Ellen on this mission.

Charlotte handed Ellen a scrollbook. It was the same scrollbook that Charlotte was carrying.

"We'll take the gate to the northernmost part of the continent, and from there we'll use the teleportation scroll to enter. We'll do the same on the way back."

"Yeah."

It's not a demonic escape, and very high-level spells like teleportation can be done with scrolls.

A princess is a princess, even if she lost the competition.

"Let's go."

They both hope that what they're doing is a waste of time, of no use, of no value.

With such hope mingled with despair, Ellen and Charlotte headed for the warp gate.



* * *



It wasn't long before they were at the northernmost tip of the continent.

After all, neither Ellen nor Charlotte had a free pass to the Warp Gate.

I used a teleport scroll to get to Castle Epiax, an area without a warp gate.

-Hui Yi Yi

"Ugh....... weather."

The snow was knee-deep at the entrance to the castle during a blizzard. The snow that was already on the ground had compacted into ice.

On their last group mission, Herriot's suggestion that they explore the castle had Ellen and Reinhardt running laps around Ephex.

I knew it was a place where spirits roamed, and there were seven statues in what looked like a pantheon in one of the buildings.

-beep, beep

They walked through a snowy clearing.

"But what did she mean when she said she was a dragon?"

"You said you were a dragon, and you were hiding your skills."

"......and you believed it?"

Charlotte glanced at Ellen as if she believed that bullshit in the deep snow.

"I didn't believe it at the time, but then I saw the statue here and thought maybe this is where dragons used to gather. It's a coincidence."

"Anyway, if the wizard you said accompanied you in the Darklands is Elena, I'd like to know if she's the one......."

Charlotte bit her lip, unable to say more.

If Elena and Lelia are the same person, Reinhardt is too suspicious.

The Empire doesn't know what kind of castle Epiax is, they just care for it like they care for a ruin that's been around for a very long time.

But if the statue that exists here looks like Elena, and it does.

What the hell is this castle doing here?

It's clear that the place is connected to the Devil, but we don't know how, so Charlotte travels to Epiax to see for herself.

"Whoa."

-tuk-tuk

Once inside the castle, Ellen and Charlotte shook off their snow-covered clothes. The air inside the castle was as chilly as the wind outside.

Ellen asked, looking at Charlotte as if it had just dawned on her.

"Are you afraid of ghosts?"

"Ghosts?"

Charlotte tilted her head as if to say, "What are you talking about?

"Here for the ghosts."

"......?"

Charlotte narrowed her eyes at the bottomless pit.

"Not strong enough to harm, but there's a ghost walking around. Do you know......."

-Flash!

As Ellen was about to finish, they saw a flash of light down one of the dimly lit hallways of the castle.

It wasn't a natural phenomenon.

Ellen and Charlotte's faces hardened.

That wasn't the end of the story.

-blink!

Something, a white light that felt like holy light, flashed across the hallway.

-Whoops, as soon as she's gone, she's gone again.......

Someone's voice.

Soon, Ellen and Charlotte could see a figure emerge from the corner of the hallway.

Naturally, you made eye contact with them.

"......?"

An unidentified woman with dark hair was there.

A place with a statue resembling Elena.

Reinhardt stopped by Elena's shop with a dark-haired woman.

Then, a woman with dark hair appeared in front of me.

Charlotte doesn't remember her.

But Ellen has a good memory. As a combat major, she watched the tournament a little more carefully.

Sure enough, I could recognize the face from memory in that impression.

Ellen was able to pull from her memory a picture of herself as an unlimited tournament competitor.

Radia Schmidt, 6th grade.

Olivia Ranze, who withdrew from the tournament final.

Reinhardt stops by Elena's shop with a dark-haired woman.

Paladin family.

The Order of the Nameless.

Olivia Ranze.

Adriana.

Demon Attack.

Somehow.

Reinhardt on that night when he thought he knew it all.

And.

And.......

Someday.

The man who called himself the Devil.

Reinhardt's playful confession.

The pieces of the puzzle begin to come together in Ellen's mind.

"......How do you guys do it?"

Radia Schmidt didn't know Ellen, but she knew the face of Empress Charlotte.

There are two people on the council who shouldn't be there.

"Senior, I need to talk to you."

Ellen slowly approached Radia Schmidt.

Radia Schmidt backed away slowly, her face stony.
