            Episode 458.





Most of them have lost family members and have fled from the clutches of monsters that would traumatize them for the rest of their lives.

So their mental state can't be normal.

You run for your life, and when you're running, you don't think about it, but when you get to an archipelago and you're at least out of harm's way, you're hit with the aftermath.

On the contrary, after reaching the Edina Archipelago, many of them took their own lives as they thought about what they had lost.

As Airi said, something that allows them to escape the hell of reality, if only for a little while.

It worked better than I could have imagined.

It makes you dream of peaceful images.

This had the side effect of making the evacuees obsessed with the succubi like they were looking for a drug, but in the end, it definitely helped to give them a little peace of mind after the hell they had been through.

Soon, succubi were counseling each evacuee, listening to their stories and, if necessary, controlling their dreams so they wouldn't have nightmares.

Originally, in Razak, the capital of the Edina Archipelago, the reputation of succubi like Airi had fallen into disrepute.

Public opinion even turned ugly when it became known that they weren't even human, but succubus.

But not for the refugees.

The succubi who smiled, listened, and comforted them upon their arrival in the fearful land of demons were to the refugees angels in demonic form.

So the refugees love the succubi more than they love me, the demon king, and they love their leader, the succubus queen, Airi.

What is a dream.

Even when they know that the little reprieve they find there can't change reality, they still want to dream happy dreams and love the succubi who give them to them.

You can control humans with dreams other than nightmares.

During this time, I learned something new about myself, as well as the succubi.

"Your Majesty, all personnel have disembarked."

It was a pale-faced being in black robes who came to me.

"Good job."

All ships with sails have a set sailing speed.

And since ships have been sinking with refugees at sea during storms, I have assigned mages from the Lord Vampire clan to be in charge, one for each ship.

With the wizard's help, we can sail safely through rough seas and travel quickly through calm waters.

"Also, the Thunder King is said to be returning soon."

"......Ah, okay."

When he finished, the fleet captain stepped aside.

Herriot pursed his lips and watched the vampire's retreating back.

"Riana is....... Do you think she'll like that nickname......?"

"If you don't like it, you're going to hate it. You're going to love it."

"Is that......?"

You said something about a thousand kings.

At some point, people started calling Liana de Granz the Brainiac.

And judging by the fact that he didn't say anything about it, I think he liked it.

Riana was in charge of evacuation missions and base defense at Port Mokna, the continental connection to the Edina Archipelago.

So, in effect, it was Riana who saved most of the evacuees.

On the continent, Riana.

When you reach the archipelago, Airi.

I was in charge of the refugees.

"I think we're done disembarking."

"......what?"

I thought it was going to take a while, but have the evacuees been disembarked by now?

Herriot shakes his head slightly.

"Maybe the numbers are a little low....... Um....... not?"

"Nothing happened. Let's go back."

"Yes."

This time, the evacuees arrived safely, with little fuss or trouble.

We haven't had any extreme problems lately because we've done a good job of training up front, but in the early days we had a lot of really serious issues.

You're the one who gets scared and tries to run away.

There were quite a few guys on the street who said they would kill us all on arrival.

If the devil is the cause of all this, how can we live under his rule?

There were some people who said things that weren't technically wrong, but were just outraged.

And it was clear to me that this frustration and hatred was lying dormant among people.



* * *



We know that the devil is responsible for all of this, and some people would rather die than live under his protection.

But all their anger and hatred cannot be expressed in front of me.

They know there is no substitute for me.

No one tried to do anything about it unless they were willing to die.

Of course, that means it was there.

I made no defense for myself, no excuses.

All they had to do was rescue them from the continent, give them a place to sleep and food, and make them part of the archipelago.

After the temporary shelter has cared for them for some time, they are sent to the frontier somewhere on Edina Island or another island.

Like it or not, it has to live its new life in a place we decide.

Feeding and housing them for free is temporary, but it's not like you're going to be responsible for them forever.

Just as those who arrive on the archipelago must get used to the intermingling of demons, they must also come to terms with the cause of all this: my domination.

I recognize that this vicious anger and hatred could be a knife under my chin, but they will know that there is no future for them if they do such a thing.

They know that what they eat, wear, and drink is maintained by the near-pro bono labor of demons.

Of course, they're not the only ones.

-Ohhh, His Majesty the Devil.......

-Must have left the inspection.......

Some of the people who saw me walking down the street bowed their heads deeply as soon as they saw me and didn't look up until I passed.

There are quite a few people who believe that I caused the Gate debacle, which is a rumor spread by the Empire.

If I did, there would be no reason to rescue and feed people like this.

It turns out that all the rumors about the Devil were just that, rumors, and many people actually believe that the Devil is good.

I'm actually the one who saved the entire archipelago, not just this one, but all of the gate incidents in the archipelago, by taking them down on the first day.

I said nothing that was true or false.

I didn't become king because of their support in the first place.

I have ruled them with power, and I have the strength to maintain my throne.

If my opposition grows too large, I have the power to purge them.

So whether they hated me or worshiped me, it didn't matter to me.

Some people hate me, some people worship me.

Actually, it's just something that happens all the time in any country in any era.

Back at the royal palace, Alreal.

"Your Majesty, there has been a murder in the district south of the refugee camp."

"...... is it?"

After all, there is a lot of insecurity in the country, so we hear about these crimes.

Homicide.

But instead of being shocked by it, I found myself rolling my eyes and wondering if it was just another annoyance.

"Last night, two adult males got into an argument and killed the other by stabbing him in the nasal cavity, and the perpetrator is now in the custody of the refuge's security."

"...... Investigate, and if you think he's guilty, kill him. If you think he deserves it, send him to the slaughterhouse."

"Yes, Your Highness."

Sudden outbursts of violence from refugees are nothing new.

I've come this far in a bad way, and I can't afford it, so I can't even count stealing, and there are a lot of extreme cases like this.

The point is, crimes happen, but we can't afford to build prisons at scale to house them.

"Your Majesty, a field officer has been caught stealing crops from farmland beyond the eastern district of the refugee camps......."

"Send them to the labor camp."

"Yes, Your Highness."

There is an absolute shortage of prisons to hold prisoners, so they are treated worse than refugees.

Most prisoners are used for forced labor in large-scale quarantine facilities, not prisons. It's better to use them as labor than to kill them and remove their mouths.

At some point, everything becomes just numbers.

"Your Majesty, last night......."

"Your Highness."

"Your Highness......."

"Your Highness."

Literally.

I thought I was going to go crazy.

As we walked down the hallway after the debriefing, Harriet asked cautiously.

"Why don't you take a few days off, and I can take care of the politics."

"You can't do it because you're better than me."

Her brow narrowed at my words.

"Why? Isn't that a good thing?"

"Ma, if you can get things done faster than me and make smarter decisions, what are they going to think?"

"ah......."

If the scribe under the king is better at being a king than the king is at being a scribe, there is bound to be distrust of me.

Obviously, Herriot will be a better judge of these headaches than I am, and he'll be faster.

"If you're going to do this for the rest of your life, I don't know, but if you're going to do it for a few days, you shouldn't, for your sake and mine."

It's not just a lust for dominance, it's that if you hand over the throne to Herriot, he'll have to do this for the rest of his life.

If I take over in a couple of days and people get a taste of what she's capable of, they can't help but think about that moment when she was regent.

Don't let someone too good take your place. Unless you're going to give them the job at all.

"I see. I didn't think of that. I just thought you looked so tired......."

Herriot carefully placed his hand on my forehead. Herriot's slightly cold hand touched my forehead.

Was there a column.

I'm not sure.

"Hey, you sneaky little brat. How many times do I have to tell you not to use your position to pester my highness?"

Herriot's expression turned sour at the words from down the hall.

It was Olivia Ranze, dressed in gray priestly robes.

"Oh, there she is again......."

"Why, can't I come here?"

"Why does your sister keep coming back and forth to the castle when she should be in the palace?"

"You don't think I don't know that you're trying to nail me to the altar with those words, and that you're trying to, uh, uh, just, uh, okay, kill me?"

"What are you really talking about, dumbass?"

I stare in disbelief as Olivia and Harriet get into a snowball fight.

Riana is a key frontline combatant.

Airi is a trauma nurse for the evacuees.

Herriot is my advisor and scribe, always there to give me input.

"I have a sermon to preach to the refugees who arrived today, but before that, I just wanted to see your majesty's face."

Olivia Ranze was the head priestess of the Unified Holy Order.

So.

Something akin to Protestantism was now the dominant faith in the Edina Archipelago, and Olivia Ranze had become its leader.



* * *



A hermit cult in the deserts of Gelkorgis.

Based on the information Olivia had given them, the Gazoo Galarsh of Friday had led them from the desert to the southern part of the continent.

In the far reaches of the ocean south of the continent, the Demon King has created a nation, claiming the Demon Cultists as his subjects.

I could organize a large fleet and bring tens of thousands of Demonists to the archipelago.

However, there was bound to be some noise.

Their way of believing was bizarre even to me.

Call it primitive or call it brutal.

Cannibalism, human sacrifice, and other bizarre acts were not well-received by those who thought they were doing what the gods wanted.

He was not even a normal five major gods religion, but a demonic religion, and if he routinely practiced such things, he would never be able to blend in with the general public.

So, under my direction, Olivia Ranze carried out a massive proselytizing campaign against the Satanists.

They saw me, a demon, as an agent of the demons.

I was chosen by the two holy objects because the gods and demons are actually the same thing.

An old misconception.

The demons don't believe in demigods.

They simply believed in the gods of the five major religions, but through human misunderstanding, a strange faith called Demonism was born, but the source of their faith is essentially the same.

So it wasn't so much a Reformation as it was the clearing up of an age-old misunderstanding between humans and demons.

Unsurprisingly, neither the established Five Great Houses nor the demonic religions were willing to reform.

But I was chosen by the gods to be their agent.

And Olivia Ranze, who wields both Tuan's divine power and Kier's divine power, is proof.

The Five Great Shinto religions must accept demonism.

Demigods must understand that the Five Great Lords were in fact their own gods.

So understand that there is no need for cannibalism, human sacrifice, torture and penance.

That's how we worked on merging the gods and demons.

The process was by no means smooth.

There was a huge backlash from the extremists, both among the priests of the Edina Archipelago and among the Satanists.

People who were taught to hate each other had to recognize their shared roots.

As a result, extremists from both demonism and the Five Great Houses have claimed that I and Olivia Ranze are false prophets.

But the power was in our hands.

I suppressed the extremists.

Those who wanted to adhere to traditions that didn't make sense made them into human sacrifices that they wanted to do just as badly.

I captured the priests who screamed inquisition and tortured them until they admitted I was right. I made them stand in the square and preach a sermon acknowledging that I was right and that the gods and demons were the same.

There was no extreme genocide, but many people had to die.

My and Olivia's reformation ended with evidence.

Among the congregation there arose a group of people who accepted that the roots of demonism and deism were the same, and there were priests of deism and priests of demonism.

They sincerely believed in it and sought to understand it, and as a result, priests arose who were able to wield the power of the demons.

As Olivia Ranze did.

A series of events occurred that allowed priests of the Gods to use the power of demons and priests of the Demon Gods to use the power of the Gods.

That in itself was proof.

The priests had to understand that the phenomena were in themselves a proof, a phenomenon that could never be denied.

The gods and demigods are the same thing.

It's just that different beliefs about the same entity have generated different forces.

Those priests, in their newfound enlightenment, created a new religious concept called the Unified Holy Order, whose leader is now Olivia Ranze.

In the Edina Archipelago, it was now common knowledge that the gods and demons were the same.

And it was Olivia's job to tell those truths and give people a new place of faith.

Short-term, extreme trauma is taken care of by Airi.

Long-term sanctuary comes with a newfound faith in a holy order.

Ideological shifts can easily occur in extreme situations, and within two years, the mainstream faith in the Edina Archipelago was now a theocracy.

Demonists are a problem now and then, but they don't do cannibalistic human sacrifices like they used to. If I've gone from being the agent of a demon to the agent of the gods, they're pretty much all over it.

Demons are people, after all, and it wasn't that hard to integrate them.

But they are an army.

The power of the priests of the Edina Archipelago and the Order of the Five Great Houses was never very large to begin with.

The priests of the Demon Gods were now their own army, many of whom had access to the divine powers of the gods.

It is also true that many of these priests were sent to Fort Mokhna.

To me, the priests of Satanism, who wielded the power to heal and curse at the same time, seemed to be the embodiment of some inscrutable horror.

It's kind of like, "Is this okay?" when you look at it.

After all, we're all busy in our own ways.

Like Riana said, when I see everybody's bolded, I'm like, "What's the difference between this and the Four Thousand Kings?

Three of the Four Demon Kings are human.

Is this okay?

I suppose it's not that unusual, since Larken Simonstein was also a human during the First Four Thousand Kings.

"I'll go anyway. Don't push yourself too hard, my lord."

Olivia and I chatted for a while, and then she quickly left the palace because she had a sermon to give.

The head of the Holy Order, Olivia, is technically in charge of a very important part of my military power. She's also in charge of my civilian political operations.

From religious leader to Secretary of Defense to head of public affairs.

Without Olivia, my regime may not fall, but I will die of overwork.

Herriot glared at Olivia's back as she turned away, then sighed heavily.

"There's a Senate meeting coming up."

I nodded in agreement with Harriet.

Senate.

It's now a different name for the Vampire Council.
