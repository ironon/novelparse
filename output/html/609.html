            Episode 609.





Deep underground, tangled like a tunnel.

A dim light glimmered in what could only be called a crypt.

Deep underground tunnels filled with the smell of rotting corpses and strange idols.

Somewhere in the deepest part of the tunnel.

In the center of that cavity sat a woman.

Around her, the prostrate people were listening to her story.

Remember the day the heavens opened up?

I've seen it firsthand.

You know what the first thing I said was?

Wow.

Believe it or not, it's true.

I probably shouldn't be saying that after seeing something like that, but honestly, it was amazing.

When you see a rain of light falling from the sky, even if it's on your head, you can't help but admire it.

It's overwhelming.

It was a hopeless sight.

A referee, if you will.

Yes, it was a referee.

Light was falling on the sinners.

It was a heavenly judgment on the sinners who didn't recognize the prophet and tried to torture, intimidate, and kill him.

A lightning bolt strikes the earth, and the warp gates that have served people so well must be removed from the world.

That day, I saw the Devil for the first time.

Very sad.

Very sad.

He looked like he had given up on everything.

No one believed in him, and he had this look in his eyes that said he had failed at everything.

Nevertheless, the devil spoke.

How to deal with what's coming, and how to make it a little less bloody.

You sounded desperate.

The devil's seed, desperate to survive.

You're threatening to do this or that if I don't let you go.

That's what everyone thinks, and that's what I thought at the time.

But the devil was right.

We have paid too dearly for not recognizing the prophet.

I'm one of those guilty parties.

I can't help it that so many people have died, but how many could have survived because of what you said?

Just as you can't count the dead, you can't count the living.

People don't know the goodness of that demon, and they don't want to know.

Those who know the goodness of the Devil don't tell people about it, and they don't intend to.

Isn't that weird?

Good kids should be rewarded and bad kids should be punished.

Why did the nicest kid in the world have to be the one who did the worst thing in the world. Why should he be known as the worst kid in the world?

That's weird.

That's not right. That's not right.

That the world is the way it is, that the good guys don't get the prize and the bad guys get everything. I know.

That's not true, but let's pretend it is.

We should be good, and maybe the gods will take pity on us and reward us with something.

You may not be glorified in life, but you may be glorified in death.

You know what they say about being a good person.

That's a bunch of bullshit.

You know the drill.

If the good you've done in your life isn't rewarded, it just isn't.

If all the good things you've done in your life have come back to bite you in the ass, there's just something wrong with the world.

Maybe the Devil is wrong, because his minions caused the gates.

But isn't that really all the devil's fault and not to blame?

If you believed in the devil.

If only those in power had listened to the Devil.

This wouldn't have happened.

But no one knows that.

This shouldn't be happening.

In this way, sin and punishment are pinned on one person.

They shouldn't be resting on their laurels.

Someone is a warrior.

Someone is an emperor.

Someone's a crusader.

The Pope.

You said it was for the people.

You said it was for the people.

You don't want to be seen walking around.

Fellow sinners.

Hate her because she did everything wrong.

If they start hating us too, the world might collapse, and for that same reason, we don't want to make the devil take it all on himself.

Such as.

It's so unfair.

I'm so frustrated.

Sad.

It's disgusting.

The only reason I've kept you alive so far is because there's at least one thing that's similar to my idea.

The devil didn't do anything wrong.

The devil is right.

The world is wrong.

We were wrong, too.

Those of you who believe in witchcraft, you are the wrong people.

I was wrong for not recognizing that he was a prophet and for believing in him until it was too late.

But are we born into the wrong world, or do we become the wrong people because we live in the wrong world?

I'm not sure about that.

Well, I do know one.

If it's wrong, fix it.

That's why I've trained you so well so far.

I apologize for the initial touching, but I haven't hit you or put a needle under your nails since you've been a better listener.

We've seen you believe in a demonic religion that wears the skin of a warrior.

Of course, that's because I'd rather believe in a demon god than a warrior god.

Anyway.

For too long, I've kept the veil of reality over the truth.

Too many years have gone by when sinners have walked too proudly through the world pretending to be sinners.

The saying that truth is worthless in the face of reality.

That some things are meant to be buried.

There are sins that must be seen to be believed.

That there are truths that need to be buried, people that need to be sacrificed, people that need to be held accountable, and groups that need to be protected because the reality is too harsh.

I've heard it so many times that my ears hurt now.

So.

I don't want to hear any more of that.

The Empire and the Order have long since lost their legitimacy and no longer exist for the good of humanity.

Everything else is just an excuse, and they're just monsters who exist for themselves.

That we just need to be still, that we need to hang in there, that we need to let this all pass and then think about it.

I don't believe it anymore.

The world is just the way it is.

It doesn't change.

I could go on and on about how to suck it up.

If so, I'm changing it.

I think it's better to change it.

Rowen speaks to the prostrate men, his cold eyes shining.

"Wake up."

The prostrate rise to their feet.

"Let's show them the real world."

"To the multitude who condoned so many sins, who lied and deceived the people."

"I'm going to show the people who have been silent and are now silent how sick the world is."

"When disruption occurs on an uncontrollable scale."

"The moment when they take back the sins they have committed."

"I want to see the look on their faces."

"I think it's time to germinate the seeds of division that we've buried in the name of this great cause, in the name of now being the time for humanity to unite."

If killing the pagans would only cause them to grow like weeds, Rowen knew it was better to grow trees.

Rowen did not hunt pagans.

The pagans in the refugee camp were not responsible for the theft of the remains. She should have known from the start.

They wouldn't do anything she didn't tell them to do.

This made it easy to reach the other side of the empire.

Rowen was raising the pagans to be giants, and the masters of those giants were in my hands.

The trees are owned by terrified slaves who, through years of torture and pain, have become incapable of thinking of anything but submission.

"So you don't have to live in heresy anymore."

"This, too, will be the will of the gods."

"I believe so."

Therefore, she was the master of all paganism, while not believing in paganism.



* * *



We know where Rowen is. But the scope was too broad.

We'll soon find out who Rowen has recruited. But for most people in the refugee camps, there is no such thing as a proper identity.

The popes gave orders, and Lowen carried them out.

But the popes did not know the full extent of the pagan powers in the refugee camps, nor their individual leaders.

I left it alone, assuming Rowen would figure it out.

But now that the information was important, I had to find it.

It doesn't take long either.

Two days at most, three days at most.

That would be enough to find out where Rowen was.

But time has always been an issue, and not as much time as I needed.

Death is sudden.

Like all of a sudden the heavens opened up, all of a sudden a gate opened and things became this way, and then the world became this way.

The reason for the destruction is trivial.

Just as a few small misunderstandings and miscommunications spelled doom.

Often, a trigger isn't a big deal.

-Kill! Kill!

"......."

I was watching a building burn in a refugee camp.

Thousands of people were trampling over the bodies of the fallen and throwing them into the fire.

It's a common sight.

Murder is a common occurrence in refugee camps.

But this time, the direction is different.

The refugees killed the guards.

Taking the spears from the guards, he stabbed their bodies.

It wasn't the shacks in the refugee camp that were burning.

The Guard headquarters was burning.

In the falling snow, I watched as refugees, driven by vengeance and madness, burned down the guard headquarters.

It was revenge for the persecution and oppression they had suffered.

It only takes a small act of violence to stir the pot of hatred. The guards are only human.

The moment they realized that their violence was not absolute, it was inevitable that the flow would break down.

Massive riots erupted in the Huangdao refugee camps.

They were killing guards, burning guard headquarters.

Getting started is easy.

And the moment it began, even the initiator would be unable to control the great tide of revenge.



* * *



"Your Majesty. It must be suppressed."

The emperor listened to the story with a stony expression.

There's a massive riot in the refugee zone, killing guards and setting them on fire.

At first, it was just a small incident. But I knew that whoever started this, once they unleashed their hatred of the Guard, they could leave it alone and it would take care of itself.

The guards are a handful compared to everyone in the camp. They've managed to keep the refugees under control somehow, but when that fails, people won't take it anymore.

It doesn't matter who started it.

They've already turned their backs on the guards; all they need is an opening.

To say they turned their backs on the Guard is to say they turned their backs on the Empire.

At this rate, the refugee camps will become complete lawlessness.

And the rising hatred will not end with raiding and killing the refugee camp's guards and burning their headquarters.

If there comes a moment when that anger is directed at the imperial family.

What to do then?

The ecliptic has long been a sand castle on the verge of collapse.

The gunpowder was ready, waiting for the moment to ignite and blow up whatever the trigger was.

Unless you can feed the refugees.

Unless you can take care of their cold and hunger.

Unless you can provide them with a minimum level of safety and comfort.

It's just something that was bound to happen someday. Whatever the cause, the problem is always the gunpowder, not the tinder.

But empires can't fall.

It shouldn't fall apart.

Not yet.

It can never fall apart.

"Yeah......."

The people were crushed by the terror of the guards.

The riots happened because hate crossed the threshold of fear.

You can't give them bread.

Because there is no bread.

You can't give a hungry, angry crowd everything they need.

There is only one thing the Empire can give them.

Fear.

"Send in the army and the knights. Summarily execute all those involved in this matter."

The only thing that can hold back the hate and anger.

Fear.

The violence that can bring that fear.

Unfortunately, the empire was strong, if not wealthy.

Now more than ever.



* * *



Can a nation that does not protect its citizens, but rather kills them, be called a nation at all?

Sure, they can exist.

As long as a state has the violence to sustain itself, it can continue to exist regardless of its legitimacy.

Massive riots broke out in the Huangdao refugee camp.

The guards were killed, and their headquarters burned to the ground. The Guards retreated to the ecliptic in a massive withdrawal.

Temporarily, the refugee camps became lawless.

But the violence didn't solve everything.

The outraged crowd had to direct their anger somewhere, and they had to find a scapegoat.

But only for a moment.

There was a bloodbath.

The Empire deployed large armies and knights to destroy any sign of violence.

The Knights Templar, a group of superhumans, could single-handedly slaughter a crowd of hundreds.

On top of that, the riot was quickly quelled when the lynch mob was called in to put down the riot.

Swords and spears slaying monsters sounded better to people.

Violence fueled by rage, in the face of a ruthless violence that bordered on the inscrutable.

The riots were brief.

Thousands of guards are dead.

However, in just a few days, hundreds of thousands of refugees were slaughtered.

The Empire crushed the outbursts, as if to nail down the idea that violence was the sole province of the state.

Fear shut everything down and held it in.

In the end, though, this took away all justification.

Everyone knows it's a lie that empires exist for the good of humanity.

The brief riot turned into a massive carnage, and the rampaging crowd was overwhelmed with fear and forced to hold their breath.

The Empire can't provide for the refugees, but it can kill them all within a few days.

It was impossible to overturn an empire by rioting.

Truth is probably good.

People still hate the devil.

Only one thing has changed.

People hate empires, too.

What's the difference between a demon and an empire?

People held their breath, but they began to whisper it to each other under their breath.
