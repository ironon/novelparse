Episode 360





And because the questions I get are so bizarre.

It was supposed to be heavy, but it just didn't feel that way. It still felt more like a student and a teacher than a demon and a Black Order member.

But we can't talk about this forever.

"Before I share information about Cantus Magna, there are a few things I'd like to know."

"Ask. If it's a question I can answer, I'll answer it."

"You're not a wizard, are you?"

EpinHauser.

He's not a wizard.

So the first Black Order I encountered, the one that showed up right after I killed Aaron Mede, would not be Mr. Effinghauser.

It may or may not have been Ms. Effinghauser at the cross-dressing contest.

The wizard is Mr. Mustang, the teacher of Class B.

It's not like Mr. A is in the Black Order and Mr. Mustang is in Cantus Magna, right?

If you're not a wizard, why are you in a magic coven?

"There's no reason you have to be a wizard."

Dr. Effinghauser could only reply. I don't know what the conditions of membership in the Black Order are.

But the last one, Aaron Mede, was just a mere mere mere mere mere mere mere mere mere mere mere mere mere mere mere mere mere mere mere. If the Black Order has ranks, I don't know where Dr. Epinhauser falls on the scale, but he's certainly not one of them since he came in contact with me with his face exposed.

"Cantus Magna and the Black Order are....... What is the relationship?"

"Cantus Magna wants the Order's sobriety, which is why he is so relentless in his search for us."

"Is there actually a fight going on?"

"Yes, the history of knowledge between the Order and the Cantus Magna goes back a long way."

The battle between Cantus Magna and the Black Order was long and drawn out, with the latter coveting sobriety for a long time.

That would mean that Cantus Magna would be in a position to raid the Black Order.

The Black Order was known for its negative image of using evil and dangerous magic, while the Cantus Magna was known for its positive image of being the sobriety hunters who raided mages who practiced such sobriety.

Of course, it's true that the Black Order does indeed possess dangerous magic, and it's true that Cantus Magna raids them, so it's not like there's a lot of misinformation out there.

It's just that they don't realize that what Cantus Magna is doing is nothing short of robbery for the Black Order.

As such, it has become one of the Black Order's aspirations to find and destroy the home of the Cantus Magna, the organization that salivates over their sobriety.

"So, what do we know about Cantus Magna?"

"That's why they collect sobriety."

With that, Effinghauser stops walking and stares at me.

"Their goal is to complete an artifact called Akasha."

"......."

Since Antirrhinus had this information, the Black Order may have already known about it.

He stares at me, and says something short.

"......Akashara. I've never heard of you."

Mr. Effinghauser nodded in silence.

It was clear that the Black Order had no knowledge of this information.

This raises another question.

Even the Black Order, which has been at odds with Cantus Magna for a very long time, was unaware of Cantus Magna's true intentions until now.

Antirrhinus spoke as if he had been in and out of the Cantus Magna briefly.

If Antirrhinus was able to learn of Akasha's existence from his short time in the world, it makes no sense that the Black Order, even as an enemy, would not know by now.

Antirrhinus may have been active in the Cantus Magna for longer than he himself says.

"Where did you get that information?"

Dr. Epinhauser asks.

If Antirrhinus had been active in the Cantus Magna for a long time, he may have hunted the Black Order in the name of the Cantus Magna.

Soon.

Even if it was decades or centuries ago, Antirrhinus would still be considered an enemy to be destroyed by the Black Order.

If the source of your information is someone who was an insider at Cantus Magna, they might want to kill you.

"Sorry, we can't reveal that."

It was an uneasy partnership to say the least.

"If you can't be sure of the source, the information is less reliable."

"I don't think it's entirely accurate either."

After all, it's possible that Antirrhinus lied to me, and he's not exactly a great man, so it's not impossible that the story about Akasha is a lie.

"However, I do know that Cantus Magna's purpose is to complete an artifact called Akasha. I'm told it's an artifact intended to contain magic, and I don't know what happens to it when it's finished. But it can't be anything out of the ordinary, and among the many magics it contains, there may be something I want, at least that's what I'm thinking."

I don't know what Akasha is specifically, so it's a bit of a stretch. But given that the Black Order doesn't know about Akasha either, it's clear that Cantus Magna has kept its secrets well for a very long time.

Except you missed the one blotch: Antirrhinus.

"Hmmm....... That's completely unexpected and needs to be verified."

Dr. Effinghauser says so.

"I don't know about all kinds of ancient artifacts, either, so I'll see if the Order has any information about them."

Eppinhauser is actually a member of the Order, but he's not a mage himself, so wherever the Order's headquarters are, there's bound to be more information there.

"Does the Order know of any way to contact Cantus Magna?"

"If I knew the easy way out, I wouldn't have contacted you."

This was an expected answer, so I wasn't too disappointed.

"They've found us, and we've found them, but they haven't found our core, and we haven't found theirs."

There may have been small skirmishes, skirmishes and fights, but no all-out war.

Cantus Magna would love to raid the Black Order's headquarters, steal all their magic, and stuff it into Akasha.

And the Black Order would love to raid such a Cantus Magna home base and wipe them out.

But that hasn't happened so far.

"You've heard rumors of the Black Order practicing evil black magic or conducting experiments."

"Yes."

No way.

"It's a rumor, spread by the Order to attract Cantus Magna to a region or place."

It turns out that all the crazy rumors about the Black Order are actually made up by the Black Order.

In other words, they framed themselves to kill their enemies.

The Black Order was willing to do things to tarnish the Order's image in order to destroy its enemies.

So the Black Order was actually just trying to attract Cantus Magna by spreading bizarre rumors about their invented sobriety, but they didn't actually massacre civilians or anything?

"So you're saying you didn't actually use sobriety or anything?"

"Of course, in order to catch them, there has to be magic being practiced in the place that they don't know about. They don't bite on just any bait, of course, and the results are both successful and unsuccessful, but in the end we were unable to reach their core."

Effinghauser stares at the trees.

"Of course, I'm not going to say that there aren't human casualties that the Order has caused. Any sobriety must come with sacrifice....... But I don't see any reason to excuse you for that."

Eppinhauser thought it odd that he should be crying over the loss of life of a demon who had infiltrated the Insei.

No.

It's so ridiculous that you're treating cross-dressing like it's evil now.

Anyway, we don't know what the real purpose of the Black Order is.

But it's clear that the Black Order's tiresome struggle with Cantus Magna has made the destruction of Cantus Magna one of its most important aspirations, aside from its true purpose.

This one wasn't much different from Antony's.

Fish for cantus magna with sobriety as bait.

There's also the cooperation of the Black Order, which has long fought Cantus Magna.

"They're not going to take every bait, and if your goal is for them to complete an artifact, you don't want to put out a bait that's too big and end up with them completing the artifact."

We must also assume that Cantus Magna's raids were not dealt with.

Unless you know what Akasha is, you're setting up a very large bait that they're bound to fall for, and then failing, which can lead to even more unexpected results.

"Well, for now, it looks like we need to figure out what Akasha is."

Working with the Vampire Council.

We also established a working relationship with the Black Order.

It was a bit of a shock to learn that the Order's representative was Mr. Effinghauser.

Every situation has its own anxiety, but it's starting to come together in the way I want it to.

My identity is no longer a mystery to me. I had no choice but to expose myself in order to reach out to so many groups.

Dr. Effinghauser watches me steadily.

"Reinhardt."

Reinhardt, not Valier.

Of course, he doesn't know that the Devil's son is named Bali, the same as the original Devil, so he calls him that.

Mr. Effinghauser looks at me and says, "You're right.

I don't know what emotions he's feeling in those emotionless eyes.

Except he called me Reinhardt, not the Devil's son.

"Don't make foolish choices."

With those words, I saw a lot of emotion in his face.

What's a stupid choice? If it's a stupid choice, I think I'm already doing it.

He seemed to think I was still his student.

We don't know what EpinHauser wants, or what the Black Order wants.

I don't even know what you want from me.

However.

Because he still treated me as a student.

"Yes, sir."

I treated him, too, as a teacher, still.

The link to the Black Order is Dr. Effinghauser.

We don't know how he communicates with the order or what he actually does.

The setup I wrote is true, but the parts I didn't write are filled with things I don't know.

Mr. Effinghauser is a patriot.

It is unclear whether or not that attribute of the Patriots is related to the Black Order.

However, the Black Order can never be an anti-Imperial organization. My description of Dr. Effinghauser as a patriot would be true.

But why would a pro-imperial organization keep me alive? Is it because they think my existence somehow benefits the empire?

For now, it was clear that they were very cautious about touching me. I was not yet on the radar of the Black Order, as they would rather work with me to destroy Cantus Magna.

Mr. Effinghauser's advice: don't do anything stupid.

That in itself could be interpreted as saying that my behavior will change the Black Order's actions or attitude toward me.

Mr. Effinghauser will report to the Order's headquarters or something like that about Akasha, and if he can find a clue about it, he will.

If you don't have it, bait the Black Order's gold or your gold to draw Cantus Magna.

I can organize a withdrawal of such magnitude that they will have no choice but to take it. It will be close to all-out war.

Either the Black Order and my factions get smashed, or Cantus Magna gets smashed.

One of two things will happen, and Akasha's whereabouts will be determined then.

Time passes.

In anxiety and impatience.

"Are you feeling a little weird lately?"

I was on vacation," said Liana de Granz, who was staying in her dorm for a few days, then going to the Duke for a few days, then repeating.

"What."

"I'm usually a little off-kilter, but lately I've been feeling a little....... Hmmm......."

Riana looks at me, crosses her arms, and mutters.

"It's like water on wine. It's like water on wine."

It's not the kind of analogy you'd make at your age, but it's not too far-fetched for Riana, who I'm sure is sipping her drink in the corner of the house.

"Maybe I'm just tired."

"Really? It's vacation, what's the big deal, get some rest."

"I'll take care of it."

"Well, whatever."

Riana would say that, and then she would go somewhere. Not necessarily because of training. Not that she doesn't do it.

Anxiety that one day this life will end.

Because of this, my recent behavior has seemed a bit odd.

"......what did you ask?"

"No, just."

You're staring at Ellen's face while doing nothing in training.

"What, what's with the sudden....... You have something to say?"

"Huh? No?"

"No, you scared me, ah......."

You're talking to Harriet at the Society of Magical Research mansion, and suddenly you tap her on the shoulder and she freaks out.

"Reinhardt. Let's go on a date!"

"Sure."

"......?"

"Where are you going?"

"Uh, ah. Huh? Ah, Gee, I'll think about it now!"

Or saying yes when Olivia says something out of the blue that I would normally say no to.

Even if I think.

I was being a bit of a screw up.
