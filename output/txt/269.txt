Episode 269





-Your Majesty, I have heard stories about the child, but....... If that child can improve your condition, I must meet him at least once, I promise you. Even if the child knows nothing, I will protect his safety with my honor. Where is the child?

-I don't know, I don't know, the sealer doesn't know, the kid doesn't know where he is in the end, so it's all pointless.

Charlotte had said that she and I were the only ones who had a clue about Bali.

For some reason, you didn't tell the vassals about my whereabouts.

Did it have something to do with what Charlotte was going through, and Charlotte is no longer in contact with Valerie because she thinks I might be in danger?

It is very likely that Charlotte's powers are not superpowers.

If it's just a superpower that's dangerous, there's no reason for it to offer to find me.

-I have made a vow, Lord Tana. If I ever get blood on my hands again, kill me.

......In the end.

When someone died in the Palace of Spring, it was Charlotte's doing.

The power ran wild, and Charlotte killed people.

And you don't remember it.

-......charge.

-Promise.

-......No promises.

-Promise me, please.

Savior Tana gave no answer to Charlotte's begging for death.

The conversation is over.

I quickly hid in the instrument storage room at the end of the hallway on the right, next to the performance room. The door was open, and there were no instruments stored there. The only way I knew it was an instrument room was because it was full of what looked like racks.

The musicians would have taken all the instruments.

I thought about closing the door, but the sound of it might be detected, so I hid myself in the darkness of the room.

There is no use for Charlotte here, no use for Darius and Tana on the viola. The recital hall is empty, and this place is even more empty.

The vault was dark with no lights on, but that's not what I need, and all I need is sound.

This is actually a good thing.

-delay

Charlotte's bedroom door opened, and she heard Darius and Tana's footsteps.

-Wouldn't it be better to watch him sleep?

-to no avail. I've tied myself up and slept, but it was all for naught.

-......So, you're still not out of the palace yet?

-I guess, but....... Maybe it's just that you don't deviate.

-You mean you might show up at Tetra or the Winter Palace?

-I'm just guessing. We can only hope it's not possible.......

It's clear that they're talking about an event that's already happened, but I don't know what that event is, so I can't follow the conversation.

No restrictions on movement.

I only understood that it had something to do with Charlotte's abilities.

-By the way, is your shoulder okay?

-......It's okay, it's not a big deal, I was just caught off guard. I can still handle it.

-Will you not go to the priest?

-......It's dangerous for me to have a record of being treated by a priest. Your Highness could hurt me....... You know what I mean.

-Yes.

-His Majesty may be listening. I shall refrain from such talk.

-I see....... I was careless.

Charlotte's abilities went into overdrive or something, and Saviolin Tana was injured.

To the point of hurting her.

Is Charlotte's power enough to hurt Ms. Chanapelle?

They seem to have kept the very fact that Charlotte attacked Savior Tana a secret.

Charlotte's powers run amok, she loses her cool, and Savior Tana, acting defensively, finally realizes it's too late and kills her.

-um.......

As they neared the palace staircase leading down to the first floor, Savior Tana stopped walking.

-Is something wrong?

I feel it.

She's on guard.

-something.......

I held my breath.

Clear presence.

Saviolin Tana feels nothing. She wonders how much time has passed.

-You didn't sleep well, no big deal.

-Seventh?

-Is it a day....... No. Is it a week, I'm not sure.

-Don't you need to rest during the day?

-This is one thing, but I'm also the head of Chanapelle, and I don't have time for that.

-I see.......

Government by day.

Charlotte's bodyguard at night.

It seems like Saviolin Tana hasn't had a break at all in quite some time.

The two of them moved again, descending the stairs.

I didn't let out the breath I'd been holding.

More.

Get a little further away.

-Well done, Dyrus. Go back.

-Yes, sir....... But are you okay? You look tired.

-That doesn't mean you can't stay.

-I see.......

-Sorry. I didn't mean to be mean. I'm just a bit, well, sensitive.

-No, I didn't think of it that way at all.

-That's great, then. Get some rest, you've been through a lot.

-Well, hopefully nothing happens.

-Yes.

Darius left the Palace of Spring.

I thought the reason for reducing the number of people in the palace was so that no one would see Charlotte killed by Savior Tana, but there were other reasons as well.

It's also to prevent someone from being victimized by a rampaging Charlotte.

There are only three people left in the palace.

Me, Saviolin Tana, and Charlotte.

It would mean that my life could be in danger at any moment. ......

Should I leave the palace? I'm already in danger.

I didn't know if the red flags my gut was throwing up were for Charlotte or for my own safety.

I heard Saviolin Tana slump into a chair in the hall.

It's right to get out of here. Charlotte's powers are powerful, Tana can handle it, and I'm pretty sure I can't.

It's more likely to be you who's at risk.

-Rumble

You can't even get out in the first place.

Saviolin Tana sat in the hall that was now the entrance to the palace. As if to keep an eye on things.

-Pat!

The corridor was getting clearer as Saviolin Tana manipulated something.

No, the magic light also illuminated my instrument vault.

Saviolin Tana suddenly lit up the entire palace.

Any chance of escape under cover of darkness was gone.

If you want to leave, you have to leave while she's away.

As expected, the viola tana did not move.

I couldn't move either.

The die has already been cast.

Hoping that nothing will happen, but knowing that something will.

I held my breath.



* * *



It was a boring time.

However, it was a horribly nerve-wracking time.

I kept focusing on killing him with self-suggestion to avoid being picked up by Savior Tana's senses.

Saviolin Tana was frozen in place.

In a temple, my undo might be a problem.

If nothing happens, what excuse do I have for taking my time leaving the planet?

Secondary issues are starting to surface, but that's all for me and Charlotte to deal with once we get through the day.

It's already late at night.

It must have been past midnight.

Saviolin Tana has somehow managed to illuminate the entire palace, which is deserted.

As if to drive away the darkness.

The instrument closet I'm in is also lit, but it's a blind spot anyway. She didn't notice me.

What a boring time that was.

-pot

The lights in the Instrument Vault have gone out.

That wasn't all.

The light from the hallway also disappeared after a while.

We don't know how they control the lighting in the palace.

Saviolin Tana didn't move. Did she put out the fire?

Why turn off all the lights all of a sudden?

No.

It's not like she put out the fire.

As I cautiously poked my head out into the hallway, I saw a different sight.

The magic lights throughout the palace flickered and flickered, then went out one by one.

-Now....... Until this.......

Saviolin Tana's voice is a small monologue. It was a voice that sounded alarmed and afraid.

I can't think of anything other than Charlotte turning off the lights.

How this is possible.

Why are they doing this.

Unknown.

Saviolin Tana gets up from her seat and moves. The direction she's moving is toward Charlotte's bedroom.

I huffed and puffed, my whole body stiffening to avoid detection.

I don't want her to find me.

Now that I've used it to the point of retirement, a number of coincidences and events have intertwined to ensure that I will not be discovered. It would include the condition that I conceal my presence with all my might.

Going undetected is the future, but if I suddenly start screaming, you'll never know.

I have no intention of testing whether or not I can change a predetermined future.

You can't make a gamble you're already taking more risky.

-Charge!

-If you are awake, please answer!

Saviolin Tana calls out as she walks down the hall.

-Charge!

She heads to Charlotte's bedroom and calls out for her.

A springtime palace in the dark.

-Flash!

-currrrr

It was a rainy night, which made it even darker, and I could barely make things out without the occasional flash of brain light.

No, it's not the light from the lightning that's causing your eyes to adjust to the darkness. The light actually hinders your vision.

-Charge!

There was a cry of desperation from Saviolin Tana.

-delay

I heard Charlotte's bedroom door open.

-.......

There was no sound from Savior Tana, not even the sound of a door opening before she opened it.

If so, Charlotte is sleeping.

-And....... Gone.......

It's gone.

I could hear the tired, despairing voice in my head.

The moment.

-Flash!

"!"

I almost screamed for a moment.

In that moment, as the light bulb went off in my head, I saw something.

Something is in front of you.

was.

-currrrr

There was a moment of silence after the thunderstorm, followed by a clap of thunder that rattled the windows.

What is.

Now.

What's in front of me?

I squinted and stared ahead, but I couldn't make out the shape of the thing watching me in the darkness. I wasn't mistaken.

Something was definitely watching me.

Suddenly, something that wasn't there a moment ago is there.

-Flash!

Once again, the lightning bolt dispelled the darkness for a moment.

A shape appeared before my eyes, for a split second, and then it was gone.

I saw it clearly.

What geometry.

He was smiling at me.

Although she looks like Charlotte.

Something that was never Charlotte was watching me in the pitch blackness.

I couldn't see anything.

But the presence of the thing in front of me was palpable.

-H.

-hmph.

-hhhhh.......

-hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.......

'It's' eerie chuckle brushes the nape of my neck.

-Flash!

In my oblivion, I could see it properly.





Dark hair and eyes as black as the abyss.

And a red pupil with a vertical slit.

Well, more like the devil himself.
