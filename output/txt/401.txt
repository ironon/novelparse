Episode 401





"Whoa......."

The reanimated corpses totaled twelve.

Their physical abilities had become so powerful that they were no match for regular soldiers, but they were no match for me and Olivia.

I know there are countless people who are stronger than me, but I'm still a superhuman in a different league from the rest of us.

I took down five, Olivia took down six, and the awakened guards took down one, and I finished them off. Just as Tiamata's power immobilized the purified corpses, Olivia seemed to draw on Tuan's power to immobilize them.

But the situation was dire.

There were bodies lying dead, their throats bitten out, their heads crushed, their limbs torn off.

The bodies seemed to number at least fifty.

In a very short time, there was carnage.

Many fled, but others remained frozen in place. Fear had taken hold of their legs.

If they killed these people because they were convinced they were satanists, shouldn't they have thought that something terrible might happen to them that existed outside their scope of thought? I don't like to laugh at people who are paralyzed with fear, but when it happens, I can't help but feel a surge of anger.

"I....... Thanks for saving me. What the hell is this......."

The guards were near the awakened bodies, so many of the dead were lightly armed, but those who recovered their senses took up arms and fought.

The man in charge, as well as the other guards, still looked terrified.

"Just get the people out of the way first. I don't have time to explain who I am."

"Yes, yes!"

Not everyone recognizes a holy object. I don't know what you'd think of a tiara in my hand, but I'm sure you'd think it was a bad thing.

I didn't intend for it to happen this way, but I'm going to be known as the warrior who jumped into the middle of a massacre and slayed the undead.

Olivia approaches me from a distance.

"Reinhard....... This looks like......."

Olivia trailed off.

I know what you're trying to say.

It could be black magic, but they seemed to focus on other possibilities.

The power to raise the dead.

This is also the power that the cursed Tiamata wielded, and it was the power of Kier, the reverse of Tuan.

It is likely that the holy power of demons is being used. That said, it's possible that an actual demonic religion is involved in this situation.

And.

The situation in the Great Square has been cleared, but there are no signs of additional guards arriving.

-꺄아아아악!

-Oh, help!

-Run away!

I could hear people screaming in the distance.

Olivia could feel the awe-stricken stares directed at us from the guards and the people whose legs had come undone.

Olivia had sad eyes.

Because people now know what to do.

I don't think she recognized Olivia and me.

It's pretty obvious what people will do when they see a mystical man or woman who appears as a salvation in a dire situation.

-God sent a messenger......!

-You saved us!

I watched as people looked at us and bowed to themselves, and Olivia watched with a complicated gaze.

Some people hang others, while others worship them.

Olivia doesn't look at them, but at the great square.

There were a lot of bodies from the shoveling, but none of them were moving anymore.

"Let's go, Reinhardt."

Something has to be done about all the crazy stuff going on in Raziern.



* * *



The carnage in the Great Square has subsided, but the reanimated corpses have shown physical abilities that exceed those of normal humans.

Importantly, this seemed to be happening all over Lazierne, not just in the Great Square.

-꺄아아아악!

-Run away, run away, run away!

Unexplained fires were engulfing the city, and reanimated corpses were munching on people.

The dead were coming back to life and attacking people, so it was only a matter of time before it got bigger.

At this rate, Raziern will be a raging inferno of reanimated corpses.

-skuck!

"Gee......."

As the living corpse was dismembered with the Tiamata, a white torch blazed from the cut, burning away the evil energy.

If this is indeed the power of the drunken Kier, then Kier is also a Tuan, and is therefore purifying the power of the same being with the same power.

-꺄아아아악!

-Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Chaos was always chaos, but Raziern was turning into a murderous chaos.

That's not all.

-Woodruff

"Holy shit, it's coming to life."

The bodies Olivia and I dealt with didn't come back to life, but those in the streets suddenly began to move in bizarre contortions after a while.

Unless they are purified by divine power or crushed to the point of no return, dead bodies rise not long afterward.

-Quizik!

Olivia stomped on the head of a body that was just beginning to move, crushing it.

Olivia's lips were pressed together, her expression twisted into a horrible grimace. No matter how undead you are, you're still crushing someone who was alive not long ago.

-Don't be intimidated!

-Cut off the limb! Cut it off!

The only saving grace was that I could hear the shouts of a battle going on somewhere.

This fight requires priests and paladins, not just armorers.

However, it is doubtful that there are many high-ranking priests in the small provincial state of Levaina. In fact, even the priests in the Great Square were bitten to death, unable to do anything without freezing. They're not used to fighting.

"Any idea when help from the Alternate Empire will arrive.......? Or will it even come......?"

Olivia muttered in despair.

There's a warp gate, so when word gets back to the Empire, reinforcements will come, and there's a specially trained Imperial force, so we'll be able to deal with that, but can Raziern survive this bizarre situation where the dead are coming back to life?

In Raziern, which had suddenly become a living hell, Olivia and I ran and ran to find the epicenter of the outbreak.

Slicing, dicing, and crushing the reanimated corpses you encounter along the way.

-Woof!

Burning houses were crumbling.

A naturally occurring fire would never spread this fast.

There's no way Lazerne could have gone up in flames so quickly without someone setting it on fire in an organized fashion.

"Reinhardt! Over there!"

I wonder how far she ran. Olivia pointed to the end of the straight avenue.

There, in black robes, was a group of men.

Someone waved a hand at an otherwise intact house, and I could see the wave of flames engulf the entire building.

Someone setting a fire.

Is it magic?

And in the midst of those robes, he was the only one on horseback.

No, it's not just words.

"Ghost horse......?"

It was a translucent horse, a blur of blue and white.

A ghost horse called a phantom steed.

In the midst of the group, the figure on the ghostly horse turned its head toward us from a distance.

The distant flames made it difficult to see the shape of the figure.

But it felt obvious.

Git warns you.

That thing is watching me.

In the distance, both Olivia and I could see the black-robed figure spurring away.

I don't know who he is.

But it's coming.

"Tiamata is now yours."

"Yes."

It was clear to me that Olivia was no match for unarmed combat.

Tiamata in Olivia's hand, Alsbringer in mine.

The ghost horse doesn't run, it glides through the streets, charging toward us at an unbelievable speed.

-Slurp!

It approaches us, wielding an elongated binoculars in its black-robed hands, its face not even visible through its robes, just a black mass.

It rides up on a ghostly horse with a spear in its left hand and a sword in its right.

In a flash, the knight approached, swinging his spear at Olivia and his sword at me.

-Quack!

-Bam!

I jerked away from the grip with a searing pain, and Olivia's posture swung wildly.

I wasn't hurt, but the force of the weapon was too much to bear.

-Kurrrrrr

Each of the weapons he held in his hands was shrouded in an unidentifiable black aura.

"What are you assholes doing?"

My question to the phantom horseman, who quickly closed the distance between us after one attack, is answered by a voice slowly emerging from the darkness.

"By the devil."

A knight on a charging ghost horse, says Nazik.

"You wish for the destruction of Levaina."

......?

When I!



* * *



I don't even know these guys.

What kind of bullshit is that, that the Great Demon wants Levaina's destruction?

I don't understand.

And if this is the extent of their power, why have they been silent until now? Have they expanded their ranks?

We could only make uncertain estimates, but nothing was certain.

But the ghostly horsemen rode in again, this time carrying two dark weapons.

It's not like a horse can run.

It moves in, this time targeting only Olivia, not me. As if it knows it has to take out Olivia first.

-Whoosh!

The first attack was hard to take, but Olivia is imbuing Tiamata with powerful divine power this time. Tiamata would be more effective in Olivia's hands than in mine.

-Bam!

A fierce shockwave exploded from the sword that met Olivia's. Olivia didn't retreat this time, but the ghostly horseman appeared to be unscathed, moving past her.

The rider stares at Olivia, still. She can't tell what he's thinking in the darkness.

The ghostly horsemen had decided to take on the two of us, and the black-robed horde had disappeared from the street.

You can't run away.

The ghost horse he's riding is not a normal horse.

It's as if we're defying the laws of physics.

-Bam!

"Boom!"

It rushes up, slams into him, passes him on the other side, and then rushes back down again as if he had no inertia.

The subjects moved as if unbounded by inertia, and the speed and power of the striking and thrusting weapons were real.

"Reinhardt! Watch out!"

-Quack!

"Boom!"

Even with my magical enhancements, I felt a powerful pain in my wrist as I parried his spear, as if it would shatter.

But it's not just a consensus-destroying force.

It hits me once, and then spins around in a frightening turn without giving me a chance to recover from the impact.

-Benefit!

"Holy....... Shit!"

Without any recoil, the phantom rider lunges at me with his spear in my face.

I don't know what it is, but you're trying to kill me because you're on the side of the devil!

-Bam!

Just as he was about to thrust his spear at me, Olivia jumped in and parried his spearhead.

-Kiiiiii!

In an instant, the horse's head swiveled, and the ghostly rider who had retrieved the spear returned to the flank.

"Are you okay, Reinhardt?"

"Yes, for now."

I don't know the details of his abilities, but the Ghost Rider's abilities are far beyond my own. I don't know how it compares to Olivia's, but it's clear that he finds her annoying.

"How do I say that?"

A ghostly horse whose movements seem to defy the laws of physics. The rider's helplessness is one thing, but when he's on that ghost horse, he's got the upper hand.

"I'll try to catch it somehow."

In addition to the Tiamata in Olivia's hand, there was a small white star in her left hand.

With her magical and divine enhancements maximized, Olivia almost looks like an angel descended upon the battlefield, even though she's out of place in this situation.

With everything around him on fire, he seemed to have come down for judgment rather than salvation.

-Kiiiiiiiiiii!

The ghost horse lets out a grotesque whinny and charges Olivia and me once more.

-Quack!

The sound of weapon against weapon rang out, and the rider didn't pass Olivia this time.

No, it didn't.

Olivia and I were pushed back by the countermovement.

That wasn't the end of it.

-Kang! Ka-kang! kang!

Rather, she was trying to immobilize the horse and drive the rider back. Olivia aimed at the horse and swung her weapon, but the rider knew what she was doing and parried her every strike with his spear and sword.

Olivia is Olivia, but the Death Knight's power is immense.

She was skillfully parrying Olivia's swings with both hands, wielding her sword and spear with both hands.

It's a ridiculous monster.

But.

Pincer attacks are absolute.

While he focused his attention on protecting the ghost horse from Olivia's attack, I grabbed the rider's back.

First, you need to get off the horse before you can think about the next.

What you need now is speed, not strength or skill.

It's been a while since I've used it in real life.

Fast (迅速).

Focus the power of self-suggestion on speed.

Other forces are also added to it.

The stronger the enemy is, the stronger Alsbringer strengthens itself. Since the enemy is clearly stronger than you, the condition is met.

One step.

The moment you take a step.

I caught up to the back of the rider with such speed that even I was surprised at my unaccustomed speed.

The rider, however, seemed to react to my speed, parrying my sword with a spin of his spearhead.

-Bam!

"Boom!"

It was the best speed I could muster at the moment, but the rider reacted to it.

But like I said.

In the end, pincer attacks are absolute.

With the spear in his left hand blocked and Olivia's sword in his right, the ghostly rider found himself with both arms locked, unable to move forward or backward.

It moved like it was defying the laws of physics, but it never moved sideways.

The moment that stopped me in my tracks.

-Ka-dum!

With her free left hand, Olivia snatched the rider's sword from his grasp. Enveloped in light, Olivia's grip on the rider's sword tightened. Twisting it wildly in her hand.

-skuck!

With a tiamaata, you blow the ghost horse's head off.

-keeeeeeeeeeeeee!

With an eerie whimper, the ghost horse turned into a blue mist and scattered, and we quickly distanced ourselves.

The rider dropped to the ground on the back of the horse, which was now behaving erratically.

-Thump!

The rider in black robes said nothing about the loss of his horse. Except for those first words, he never spoke, never showed any emotion or mood.

-Bam!

The lance, longer than he was tall, was abandoned by its rider, and he clutched only the darkened sword.

"What are you guys?"

Olivia speaks to the rider, who is still holding his sword and watching the two of us.

"Are you the Devil's minions?"

The rider's skill was one thing, but finding out who they were was more important to Olivia.

In his robes, the mysterious horseman looks at us and speaks.

"Yeah."

This is crazy, crazy stuff.

When I!

I don't know you guys!

A clueless man claims to be my servant.

"What the prophets could not do, we will do."

Prophet.

Seeing as how they call the devil a prophet, I'm guessing they're Satanists.

I'm not entirely sure what's going on here, but I think I know what their purpose and intentions are.

Now that the Demon has failed in his assault on Levaina, these people who think they're prophets are raiding Raziern to accomplish what I failed to do?

I can't believe it's gotten to this point.

-Kurung!

His sword begins to pulsate with black energy.

It's a far cry from the momentum we've seen so far.

It's not as if you've gotten off the horse and become less combative, but as if you're about to unleash your true power.

The weapon itself, with its chilling aura, already seemed like something bizarre was going to happen the moment they met.

"Yeah."

Olivia's mouth curled into a wicked grin.

"The devil, that's not possible."

Olivia isn't here because she needs to get to the bottom of this case.

If the Devil's minions are making Raziern look like this in real time.

He was convinced that the demon had saved him, or that there must have been some other reason.

I said I needed to be convinced.

So, I just got it.

No matter how repulsive and unpleasant human behavior may be, all humans are fundamentally evil.

However.

You won't know the root of every demon.

-꺄아아아악!

-Sa, sa, help me, help me, help me!

-Kaaaaaaaaaah!

If it's the devil doing this.

The devil is evil.

Olivia is convinced.

"And."

Olivia Ranze clutches her tiara and glares at the Black Knight with an eerie expression.

"To borrow from the powers that be, no more begging."

Olivia abandoned God.

But she's still using divine power, lending her strength. But Olivia now seemed to be trying to deny even that principle.

"Light."

I'm not asking you to save us.

I'm not asking you to lead us.

It's not a plea.

"Come to me."

To the light, follow me.

Olivia commands.

-Woof!

The white light from the thiamatha becomes more and more intense and eventually begins to take on a golden hue. Olivia Ranze uses tiamata in a different way than I do.

I know now that the divine power gives Olivia strength in some way, so I don't have to ask for it, and I don't have to believe in it.

Olivia was chosen by God.

To the gods, who lend me strength in whatever I do, because I am chosen.

Now we tell them to give it their all.

-Currrrrr!

Olivia Ranze, caught in a torrent of divine power so immense that the atmosphere shudders, stares at the Black Knight with murderous eyes.

Not even Libertarian Rancher was this good.

While Leviathan might have the edge in practical skill, I could feel Olivia overtaking him in terms of divine power.

Even from my vantage point, I could feel the atmosphere shake with a storm of divine power.

But the seemingly evil being in front of her didn't back down at all.

The black knight's aura was ominous, but the storm of divine power raging through Olivia was too great.

Olivia's divine power was already immense, but amplified by the Tiamata, it seemed as if the release of that condensed divine power would be enough to destroy the world.

Olivia in the light and the knight in the dark.

The black knight lunges at Olivia.

But it just looked small and shabby, like a ferry against the tide.

Facing the charging Black Knight, Olivia focuses her Holy Power on Tiamata.

A dazzling golden glow began to focus on Tiamata.

Tiamata and the Black Knight's sword clash, the latter's holy power seeming to explode at any moment.

Stabbing sword, Olivia from top to bottom.

Honest, but with a pressure that feels like it could bring the world down.

That moment when two swords clash.

-Flash!

I watched a storm of light engulf the world.
