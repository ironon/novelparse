Episode 413





Ellen and Charlotte left the temple.

Charlotte had an artifact that cast a cognitive disruption spell, and Ellen was wearing a robe.

I was prepared for the unwanted attention.

As Charlotte walked down the street, she briefly explained to Ellen where she was going.

How he and Reinhardt found a clue while wandering the streets of the Aligarh district, how he delivered a letter to the shopkeeper with Reinhardt acting as his messenger, and how they stopped corresponding after the last letter, when he became convinced he had lost his mind.

And finally, the whole leave the ecliptic thing.

As she spoke, Charlotte realized how much of a problem she had been creating.

If only you had pursued that wizard, if only you had caught that child, if only you hadn't bet on false hope.

If you had killed the demon.

Everything that's happening now would have never happened.

Charlotte realizes in a new way that she is a sinner, not only of the empire, but of all mankind and of the times.

I was letting my approval, my faith, and my tenuous attachment to it grow a cancer that would eat away at my empire.

If it weren't for Reinhardt, he might have awakened as a demon long ago and started another bloodbath.

In a fit of self-pity, Charlotte pours out her heart to Nazik.

"...... You don't understand me, do you?"

"I don't understand your behavior, but I don't know what you've been through."

"......."

Ellen doesn't say that Charlotte's behavior is right or wrong.

Ellen doesn't know how sick Charlotte was, or how awful she felt in the demon castle.

But after a harrowing life of captivity and near death, the boy who saved him.

I wouldn't have suspected it at the time.

Ellen didn't think it was possible to doubt the man who had risked his life to save her in that situation.

Of course, Charlotte's actions also resulted in a missed opportunity to capture the demon.

The boy who saved his life.

If you've tried to believe it all the way to the end, only to discover the truth: you've been taken advantage of.

Ellen could tell that Charlotte must be devastated.

Ellen doesn't know how to be comforting.

However, the truth is that Charlotte's choices are having a very negative impact on the continent and the empire.

"There's no point in beating yourself up."

Up, not up.

That was all Ellen could say.

"......Yes."

For now, we can only hope that we have the tiniest of clues.

Life goes on, even if the presence of a demon is causing a stir in the world.

The relentless hawking of Aligarh's shopping district was just another in a series of routines that had nothing to do with the Devil.

No, it was the appearance of a demon that was driving the demand for self-defense.

Ellen felt a renewed sense of excitement as she watched the adventurers hit the road.

Though she wasn't serious about being an adventurer, Ellen had seen them in the Darklands with Reinhardt.

Adventurers continued to appear even as the demon threatened the continent.

Charlotte said to Ellen as she walked past the sight.

"They say a labyrinth has been found in the Darklands that may be Richie's tomb."

"Rich?"

"Yes."

Ellen shook her head at the out-of-the-blue richness.

"The labyrinth hasn't been completely breached, but there are adventurers who wandered in there and brought back a few grimoires. I don't know, but they're pretty good. That's why there's quite a commotion."

"Really?"

"If that's all that's been found, and it's not even broken, I wonder what's really inside."

If a spellbook the size of Labyrinth Byproduct can cause an uproar, it's only natural to assume that there are worse spells or artifacts out there.

Charlotte, who had been walking still, suddenly clicked her tongue.

"Tsk, I hope the devil wasn't involved in what happened yesterday."

"What do you mean, yesterday?"

"...... There was a murder inside the palace, which I was also informed of this morning."

Ellen narrowed her eyes at the word murder.

"In the imperial palace......?"

"Yeah, a member of the Ministry of Magic killed the officers, took the grimoire, and got away with it. I don't know if he's just trying to sell it, but....... You don't think it's the devil's stash, do you?"

Charlotte was with Ellen to follow the demon's trail, but the imperial court was in turmoil.

"I wonder if Harriet was investigated too......."

Suddenly, Ellen understood what Herriot and Reinhardt had meant by their serious talk today.

Herriot has been questioned about what happened last night, and that's probably why they're trying to do something.

Where are Reinhardt and Herriot now, and what are they doing?

I hope you're not trying to get into anything dangerous.

Ellen thinks so.

"Were the stolen spellbooks....... were they important?"

"That's my biggest problem right now."

Charlotte says with a narrowed brow.

"You don't know the contents of the stolen grimoire."

"......what?"

For a moment, Ellen had no idea what Charlotte was talking about.

"What do you mean, it was stolen and you don't know what was stolen?"

"They'd been at the palace for less than a day and were gone before we could figure it out."

So they didn't even realize how dangerous the spellbook was.

"Yeah, I should know that."

Charlotte was going to tell Ellen everything about herself. She needed to know all of her secrets so that she could fulfill her role as a knight.

"Those grimoires, I took them from the basement of Demon Castle yesterday."



* * *



Herriot and I left the temple and headed for the palace. I don't know what we can do, but you have to be there to know what happened.

I was wearing a hood in case my face was recognizable, and Harriet was wearing a hood just like me, though I'm not sure why she copied me.

as Dwin.

Why did he steal the spellbook and get away with it?

"Of course it's going to be expensive, right?"

"It's just expensive."

She nodded at my words.

"It is also very difficult for an individual to qualify to own a grimoire. Most wizards can only access or borrow grimoires that are officially published by a large organization, school, association, or guild, and unless you're qualified, you can't access grimoires above a certain rank or level of danger."

Just as enchantments are strictly controlled, grimoires are a strictly controlled system.

"There are a lot of loose spellbooks out there because they're hard to regulate, but spellbooks are basically not something you can buy, even if you have money."

"So it's not something you can easily sell?"

At my words, Harriet glared at me.

"No way."

"...... is hard to buy, but easy to sell?"

"There's no shortage of wizards who want to keep a rare grimoire to themselves. If it's a rare spell, they'll pay a fortune for it, but if it's a very rare spell that's not yet known to the world, it's more likely to contain a new theory or method of manipulating magic than it is to be useful."

It's supposed to be a rare spellbook, but it's a very expensive item. You can't officially have dangerous magic, but you can have it secretly.

Whatever, spellbooks are worth money. Especially if they're rare.

"I don't think it was about the money, ever."

"You said spellbooks make money."

Harriet looks at me, her lips subtly pursed.

What is this scorned feeling?

"If you're a wizard good enough to work in the labs of the Imperial Ministry of Magic, you can make a fortune making copies and selling them. There's no need to steal them."

"......Uh, yeah."

Now that I think about it, it makes sense.

"So I don't think Lothar Dwyn stole the grimoire for the money."

As it turns out, Herriot was right.

If it's about money, why would he steal a grimoire and have a group of murderous thugs inside the empire when there are so many other ways to make it safely?

"That's odd. The pay would be substantial, and the Empire wouldn't use just anybody. I'm sure his identity is clear and he's been vetted......."

I'm sure they're skilled, but they could be trusted, or they could be part of the Imperial Ministry of Magic's research library. He's been killing people and stealing grimoires for reasons we don't know.

If not money, what reason.

Was the magic an end in itself?

Cantus Magna.

I couldn't help but think of that group in my head.

Was he a member of the Cantus Magna?

"Stolen spellbooks, do you know what they are?"

"I don't know, and Lothar Dwyn didn't seem to know, but apparently Richie's grave was found in Fort Darklands the other day. I wonder if that's where they took it from....... Yeah, he seemed curious about where the grimoire came from."

Ritchie's Tomb.

This is a trap designed to lure out Cantus Magna.

From there, the leaked grimoire reached the Imperial Palace, and Lothar Dwyn stole it?

According to Herriot, Lothar Dwin was curious about the source of the grimoire.

That said.

If it's Cantus Magna, it means that information about the Labyrinth of Darklands will reach them.

This means that Cantus Magna may be approaching the Labyrinth.

I thought Harriet was in the middle of something weird, but was it actually something I needed to do?

I'm not sure yet. But if the Rosser-Dwin case has even the slightest connection to the Cantus Magna, I'm going to have to look into it against Herriot's will.

I'm not yet at the point where my face is a business card. Nor do I want it to be. What I'm going through at the Temple is enough to drive me crazy, but I can't imagine not being recognized anywhere on the continent.

Of course, a coat of arms was a substitute for access to the palace, and Herriot had been shamelessly dropping in and out of the palace.

However, many were barred from entering the palace.

-The Imperial Palace is currently on lockdown.

It's no wonder the entire palace is on edge, as there's been an uprising inside the palace. All but a few nobles and officials who had business in the palace were barred from entering.

The atmosphere inside the palace was just as murderous.

The Ministry of Magic was located in the southern part of the palace, but apparently the entire palace was on high alert, with soldiers and knights scurrying about.

"I'm sure....... because it wasn't normal......."

Her voice quivered slightly with exhaustion as she arrived on the scene.

A simple murder would be one thing, but a murder inside the palace is another. Herriot is not a witness, but she spoke with the killer just yesterday.

As if she's finally realizing what the hell she's getting herself into, Harriet gently grabs the end of my sleeve. As if without realizing it.

"Don't bother, it's not going to happen, let's go to the field."

"ugh, ugh......."

Herriot and I took the tram that runs inside the palace to the location of the Ministry of Magic.

From the central palace tetra, the north was the Spring Palace, home to Charlotte, the east was the Summer Palace, home to members of the imperial family, the south was the ministries responsible for the main business of the empire, and the west was the Winter Palace, home to Bertus.

Our destination was south, but not far.

The southern section of the Imperial Palace, which housed the ministries responsible for the main business of the empire, was lined with massive buildings, and the grandiose Ministry of Magic was one of them.

The massive marble architecture was both massive and elegant.

But now the area was surrounded by a large number of soldiers, and the entrance was blocked by a guard.

In the Imperial Palace, where the atmosphere was already serious, the Ministry of Magic was at its most alert.

"......Is this something I should be doing?"

Herriot said that with a hint of trepidation, as if he thought it was something he shouldn't approach lightly.

"I'm not asking you to do anything, I'm just asking you to explore, so what's the harm?"

At my words, Harriet looked at me blankly and sighed heavily with a dumbfounded expression.

"I hate to say this, but....... Why are you such a hardass?"

When Herriot said that even I, the Grand Duchess, could see such a large number of troops, and you could not see them at all, I had nothing to say.

Really?

Come to think of it, I'm not even used to this stuff.

So you've gone from being a bully to being a hero, and now you're being treated like one?

I've come a long way from when I first fell into this world unknowingly.

"I was born this way."

"You're amazing to watch......."

Herriot followed me cautiously.

Naturally, the Ministry of Magic was the center of the action, so it was bound to get in the way first.

"This area is currently off-limits."

"I'm aware of that, but I don't know if I can......."

"Reinhard? Saint-Thuan......?"

Just as I was about to explain, I heard a voice calling out to me from behind.

The voice is pretty familiar by now.

"What's going on here?"

Bertus had just arrived at the Ministry of Magic with a group of men.
