Episode 365





Not everyone from Orbis Class joined the revolutionary forces. But an Orbis Class graduate, a senior.

There is no reason for Duke Granz to join the revolutionary forces.

But technically, there's no reason for anyone, young or old, rich or poor, to join the revolutionary forces.

Why else would you have to risk your life to do something.

Even for those who actually benefit from the revolution, it is in their best interest to join the revolution after it has occurred rather than risk their lives to join it.

If Duke Granz is a member of the revolutionary forces, he's obviously close to the core.

"That's what Mal says whenever he tries to convince me that he graduated magna cum laude, but honestly, I don't believe him."

Even senior graduation.

What a great material for the pursuit of fantasy. Riana sips her whiskey and points to her head, unaware of what I'm thinking.

"I'm not that smart, no matter how you slice it, and I don't know where this hair came from."

It's a little disconcerting to see him say that because his hair is bad, my dad's hair must be bad, but that's not what's important to me right now.

Am I correct in thinking that if Duke Granz is a revolutionary, then he becomes my ally because I'm going to ally with the revolutionaries anyway?

Whether Duke Granz is a revolutionary or not, in the end I'm only interested in delaying that revolution until after the Gate incident.

The Anti-Imperial Coalition is just a ruse, and there is no intention of actually forming it to rebel against the Empire.

The revolutionary forces, the independence of the Five Great Houses of God, were all wiped out by the Gate. Humanity, beyond the Empire, has suffered great damage, and it is impossible to dream of anything else.

This is the post-Gate, post-Endgame time to focus on rebuilding the world.

In the face of the great crisis of humanity, all petty interests disappear.

But what happens when that grand idea is lost?

Wouldn't it be better if the Gate debacle never happened....... Now, isn't that, like, better?

But in the end, I still haven't gotten to the heart of the gate situation.

I realized that these thoughts and worries were also empty.

The three kids had gotten really rowdy, so we cleaned up early. After tucking them into their rooms one by one, Riana and Kliffman said they were going to bed, too.

I couldn't fall asleep.

A surprise party planned at the last minute to cheer me up.

Honestly, I was impressed with that, but I ended up here, and I've gotten myself into a lot of trouble.

Nothing is certain.

As you stare out the window at your garden at night, you notice someone wandering around.

A man of good character.

Duke Granz.

Not knowing what to expect, I opened the door to the outbuilding.

As the door to the outbuilding opened, he walked through the garden, watched me for a moment, and then broke into a wry smile.

"Gee, looks like I'm not the only one who can't sleep."

His smile was somehow, sad.



* * *



"Did you say Reinhardt?"

"Yes, it is."

"I've heard the stories."

Being the troublemaker that he is, Duke Granz seemed to have heard a lot of stories about me.

"I mean, I've heard as much about you from my daughter as I have from you, who can throw a tantrum if I ask her to talk about Temple."

"Oh, yeah......."

Duke Granz chuckled and patted me on the shoulder.

Punching people while talking.

Riana, does this look like your dad?

Riana had apparently told Duke Granz quite a bit about me earlier in the semester, saying that there was a real weirdo at Temple. Of course, Riana doesn't seem to be the kind of girl who likes to talk to her dad much, so Duke Granz didn't really listen to my story.

Mainly.

Focus on incidents and accidents.

So.

I naturally broke out in a cold sweat.

Duke Granz.

Orbis class graduation.

Possibly a revolutionary force.

He may have a personal grudge against me for being the one who started the whole Orbis class closure debacle.

"When I heard that you fought Orbis' classmate, I thought, I don't know, but a big man is a big man."

Even if he doesn't, he's right next to the guy who was responsible for closing his alma mater.

But the smirking Duke of Granz could see nothing but admiration for his daring daughter's friend.

Either you don't care about the Orbis class, or you're just hiding your feelings.

"What happened after that might have been a little embarrassing, Reinhardt."

Rather, he was blunt about the situation.

"Yes....... I never thought that would happen......."

In fact, I had no idea that the spat would go beyond the closure of the Orbis class to the acceleration of revolutionary mobilization.

"What happens, happens."

Duke Granz looked up at the winter night sky and said.

It's like they've known about the ills of the Orbis class for a long time.

If he's saying this, he has nothing to do with the revolutionary forces.

But sleepless winter nights.

I don't know what keeps him awake, but I'm sure I'm not mistaken when I see a deep regret and a certain remorse in his expression.

As we walked along, talking, I couldn't help but glance toward the mansion and get a little giddy.

Someone was staring at me and Duke Granz.

A grown woman, arms crossed, looking at me with a narrowed brow, wondering what's so wrong with me.

When she made eye contact with me, she frowned even more and pulled the curtain shut.

I saw it, and so did Duke Granz.

"Oh, hmm....... My wife is a little sensitive."

Duchess?

Come to think of it, just as Riana didn't introduce me to the Duke, she certainly didn't introduce me to the Duchess.

Duke Granz said, sounding somehow apologetic.

What's not to like?

Or that Duke Granz doesn't go to bed until late?

But the nervous look on the Duchess's face says it all.

Disgust and contempt.

I think I felt something like that.

"Hmmmm, I'm going to go inside now. It's cold out, and it wouldn't do you any good to take a long walk at night."

"Oh, yeah. I see."

Duke Granz seemed to be holding back.

The next day.

In the dining room of the outbuilding, we had a simple breakfast cooked by the users.

Sure, it was a simple meal, but this was Duke Granz, so it was also a breakfast that could handle Ellen's gigantic appetite.

The menu was simple, the portions were not.

They hadn't had too much to drink, but they didn't look hungover either.

But there was no Herriot at the breakfast table.

"And Harriet?"

"He looks like he's sleeping."

Riana shrugged at my question. She didn't seem to drink that much yesterday, is she tired?

But Herriot wasn't sleeping.

After breakfast, I was drinking tea when I opened the front door of the outbuilding and saw Harriet come in.

"Huh? Everybody's up."

"What, weren't you sleeping?"

She shook her head at my question.

"No? I'm the first one up?"

"Then where have you been without breakfast?"

Herriot scratched his cheek, a little embarrassed by my question.

"That....... asked me to have breakfast with him, so I went to....... The Duchess has......."

At that, Riana rubbed her forehead and sighed heavily.

"After....... Why not but did."

What the hell is that? Riana says, looking at Harriet with a narrowed brow in annoyance.

"Harriet, don't pay attention to whatever my mom told you because it's all bullshit."

It was a completely different atmosphere than when we were talking about Duke Granz.

He was annoyed, but he didn't seem to really dislike it.

However, when Riana talks about her mother, she does so with a genuine sense of disgust and contempt.

"Huh? Ah....... Well, he did say a lot of nice things, though......."

Herriot couldn't say yes, of course he knew, but he could only say so with a hint of embarrassment.

"No way."

Riana snapped, "That's not possible," which only made Harriet feel worse.

Herriot joined her at the table and they drank tea.

Duke Granz.

Duchess Granz.

The look you saw last night, directed at me, or at Duke Granz.

The stare of contempt.

I called Harriet for breakfast.

This means that only Heriot was called.

Daughter of the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan.

Herriot de Saint-Ouen.

The conclusion is that the Duchess of Granz is extremely sensitive about her identity.

The conclusion is easy to draw from the look on Harriet's face, who is very troubled by Riana's words but unable to deny them.

It was clear that I had heard something I disagreed with.



* * *



After breakfast, we headed back to the dorm together.

On the way back, Duke Granz saw us off.

"Hope you're doing well, it's winter, watch out for colds."

Riana looked like she was about to throw another tantrum, but she didn't say anything to Duke Granz, though she did make a face as if she remembered what she'd told us yesterday.

Child.

Added a new property for Liana de Granz.

Duke Granz looked at each of us and said hello.

"Cliffman, you'll soon realize the power of enchantment."

"Thank you, Duke."

"Adelia, I've heard you're really good. Go for it."

"What?! Ah, yes, yes, yes. Go, thank you ......."

"Ellen, it's always nice to see you eating well. One day, the food you eat will return to your body."

"Yes, sir."

Ellen took Duke Granz's crude jokes with a grain of salt.

With the exception of Riana, they all stare at Ellen, who calls Duke Granz "uncle" with a fat face, but Duke Granz's reaction is even worse.

"Heh, heh, I'll listen to him anytime!"

No.

Did you call it that on purpose.......

I can see why Ellen called Duke Granz a good man.

"Reinhardt, you're an accident waiting to happen."

"Well, you should......."

After a subtle exchange of words, whether complimentary or not, Duke Granz looked at Herriot and said.

"That....... was sorry at breakfast this morning."

"Oh, no, no, no, that's okay, that's fine."

Duke Granz looks a little sorry for himself, and Harriet is even more devastated.

What the heck was said at breakfast at the house today?

With that, we said goodbye to Duke Granz, and we started walking back to the temple.

"Hey, wait."

"Huh?"

With the group walking ahead of me, I pulled Harriet slightly behind me. so that our conversation would not be heard by the guys walking ahead.

Of course, it doesn't really matter if you hear it.

"What did the Duchess say?"

"Oh....... That?"

Herriot looked thoughtful for a moment, then shook his head.

"You don't need to know."

That's all Herriot would say.

"No, why, what?"

"You don't want to hear it."

It seemed clear to me that what I had heard was not good, and that was true in and of itself.

"No, thank you."

"It's none of your business!"

Worst of all, it's not like we're talking about a secret, and she's looking at Riana and lowering her voice to a whisper. She makes a big show of not wanting to talk, but then she looks me in the eye.

"Oh....... I'm glad you're back to your normal self, but I didn't mean for you to bother me this much......."

Herriot sighs heavily and looks up to see Riana walking ahead.

"When you get back, come to the Institute of Magic."

Not something to talk about in Riana's presence. Herriot said tersely.
