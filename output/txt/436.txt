Episode 436





Helped to her feet by the knights, Charlotte staggered to the ground and found two people waiting for her.

Ellen and Harriet were waiting.

A temporary jail-like space to hold students who have caused incidents inside the temple.

The area was now being guarded by Shanapelle and the highest ranking mages of the Imperial Mage Corps.

Literally, it was so well guarded that not an ant could get in.

The makeshift camp where Reinhardt was now confined was even more guarded than the Tetra, the central palace where the emperor resided.

Herriot still couldn't believe what was happening, and Ellen looked calm.

Ellen didn't say anything, just that she didn't want to show it.

When Charlotte said she could come in with her, Ellen shook her head.

He said he wouldn't know what to say to Reinhardt if he met him. I denied it.

Charlotte says with dead eyes.

"Reinhardt, the devil is right."

"You're lying....... No, you're not. You're not. Why would Reinhardt......."

Her lips quivered, and she shook her head.

Charlotte didn't say anything to Harriet, who was in denial.

Ellen walked away, supporting Charlotte.

Ellen didn't say anything until the end.

Herriot stared at the camp where Reinhardt was being held, unable to turn away.

Reinhardt himself admitted that he was the devil.

Why.

Why.

When you say you wanted to protect everyone, what then?

Herriot stood there, frozen in place, for a long moment in front of the heavily guarded makeshift camp building.

"No, you don't....... No. No, Reinhardt....... No, it's not......."

Herriot mumbled to himself for a long time, as if possessed by something.

I had a lot of questions for Reinhardt.

What have we been doing all this time?

What the heck did they want?

However, Herriot couldn't even get permission to meet Reinhardt on his own.

"......."

"......."

The Emperor, Neliod de Gradias, and the First Prince, Bertus de Gradias, sat across from each other, speechless.

Reinhardt.

The man I thought was the hope of the empire turned out to be the devil.

The actions you've taken so far to save Charlotte have actually been the Devil's way of taking over the empire.

"We've made too much of Darklands and the new demon."

"......."

At Bertus' words, the emperor was speechless.

"I almost sold the empire to the devil."

Even the engagement didn't come from Reinhard himself, but from Bertus.

So this is what it's like to be smoked out of your skull.

Without realizing it, I almost snatched up the empire and put it in the devil's mouth.

The warrior who saved Charlotte de Gradias time and time again.

That's why he allowed his betrothal to the First Empress, thinking it was the only way to ensure her safety.

But it was all in the devil's calculations.

Overriding his reputation as a warrior, he accomplishes so much that he overtakes the heir apparent to the imperial throne, Bertus de Gradias, and becomes emperor.

No, there was a way to make Charlotte an emperor.

They don't raise up crumbling empires, they consume them.

The emperor and the prince were in awe and astonishment at the devil's idea, for it was unthinkable that a culprit could have come up with it, and even more so that the plan could have been realized.

"With the power of the demonic realm in my hands, I could have created any number of fake achievements, even one for defeating a demon king, and placed it in my hands, and....... I might have been able to fulfill that ridiculous plan."

"......."

It was all a calculated move.

For planting the demon's spirit in Charlotte, for saving her just in time, and for convincing the imperial family that no one but he could calm her condition.

The kind of revenge that doesn't take down your enemies, but makes them your own.

Clearly, Reinhardt was able to realize his plan.

Bertus realized that even the emperor had a knife at the nape of his neck.

Bertus, as well as Reinhard, had invited the emperor to a private audience several times because of the importance of his presence.

If you wanted to disrupt the empire, you had the option of killing the emperor.

But I endured all those small moments of revenge for a bolder goal.

What transcendent endurance, mental strength, and willpower.

Not knowing the truth, they both recognize that Reinhardt's actions thus far have been in the name of revenge.

That's why they're both horrified by his momentum, which has allowed him to become the empress's closest confidant and even her fiancé in just over a year since he infiltrated the temple.

I thought it was a minor force that I could wipe out at any time, but the demon was right next to me, not poisoning me from afar.

Not by destroying the empire, but by growing the ambition to consume it.

"And when you consider that Reinhardt's closest friends were Ellen Artorius, Olivia Ranze, and Harriet de Saint-Hilaire....... I suppose it might have been possible to push me out."

The warrior's sister.

Saint of the Five Great Houses.

And Herriot de Saint-Étienne used his magic to stop the raining meteors, a feat that even the archmage could have accomplished.

Considering what the three of them could do and how influential they could be, their becoming Demon Men was a disaster for the empire.

Of course, Ellen Artorius played a key role in uncovering the Devil's identity.

If Ellen and Charlotte hadn't picked up on the demon's trail along the way, it's entirely possible that a demon disguised as a human could have consumed the empire.

It was Bertus, the emperor, and he was out of his mind in the usual way.

Because something unimaginable has happened.

"I don't know what to do with it."

But the most important question remained.

You've captured a demon.

But it was also the end of something, and the beginning of a huge headache.

First things first.

To announce to the world that Reinhardt was in fact the Devil or not.

"Aside from the reasons why the Demon was given the choice of two holy objects, that in itself is enough to cause a schism in the Church of God."

"Of course......."

The gods are right.

If so, it could be concluded that since Als and Tuan chose the Devil, the Devil is right.

"They could tell the story that the devil has stolen the holy relic through some nefarious means, or something like that, and the crowds might believe it, but it would still cause a great deal of turmoil within the Order of Als and Tuan."

"Demon worshippers are also a problem, and I'm afraid that some of the Shintoists might try to demonize them."

Bertus and the Emperor's faces were filled with sorrow.

It's also possible that some of the Shintoists will follow the Demon King. Then it was only a matter of time before the entire continent, if not all of its adherents, would be in turmoil.

"We could publicly execute the demon and announce that there are no more Archdemons left in the world to calm public opinion, but....... I think that would be too risky."

"I suppose so. We've got the demon, but not the rest of him, and as long as he's been able to infiltrate the Temple, we'll never know how far he's planted his forces......."

Two important issues.

I have no idea what the extent of the demon's power is.

Public executions are inevitably followed by a rebel takeover. The Archdemon's existence is so vital that any demon loyal to the Demon Realm will lay down their lives for the task of reclaiming it.

And a third.

The Devil wasn't just planning to swallow up the empire.

"It's almost certain that the events at Ritchie's tomb also involved demonic forces."

"Is that so?"

"The Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan was the mastermind of the last incident, and I understand he accompanied Dwyn and Richie on their search for the grave."

The Emperor had received reports from Saviolin Tana and the Grand Duke of Saint-Thuan, and had compiled their information.

"We still don't know exactly what happened, but it's believed to have been a fight for the possession of a magic tool named Akasha. Dwyndo mentioned that the owner of the dungeon was also named Akasha."

"Akasha......?"

"I don't know the details. From what I've seen of the situation, a number of high-ranking vampires and mages were present, and I believe it was Lothar Dwyn who knew of Akasha's whereabouts. However, one of the demon's forces has betrayed him and seems intent on capturing Akasha........ I don't know. Whether the Demon King failed or succeeded in securing Akasha."

"What is Akasha?"

"I don't know."

The Emperor shook his head and added.

"But from Tana's reports, it's the stuff that makes you a god."

It's the kind of thing that makes you giggle when you hear it, but the fight to get it has caused a lot of trouble.

The moon grows many times larger, and mythical, mega-scale magic.

If it's something that those beings would fight for, you'd be right.

"We don't know what this Akasha thing is, but we can't just kill the demon at this point. If it's in his hands, that's one thing, but if it's in the hands of one of his minions, that's another."

Just as the great Valier so foresaw.

No one can bear to see a weapon capable of destroying them in the hands of an enemy.

As Luna Artorius would say.

Not out of greed for Akasha, but out of fear of Akasha.

Once the empire learned about Akasha, they couldn't help but want it.

After all, at this point, the Demon would have to die at some point, but he couldn't be killed right now.

Bertus made his way to the prison where Reinhard of the Temple was being held.

Reinhardt was the devil.

It made me suspicious of things I hadn't suspected before, and it raised a lot of questions.

However, there were questions that were answered.

It didn't make any sense to me at all, but what I couldn't understand, I now understood completely.

Female.

Reinhardt wasn't quiet to begin with.

But as if infiltrating the temple and keeping quiet weren't bad enough, the devil cross-dresses.

It was completely incomprehensible, and Bertus drew a simple conclusion from it.

Maybe the devil is supposed to be a woman.

In other words, she was a princess, not a prince of Darkland.

For now, it's clear that demons have the ability to shape-shift and disguise their bodies.

That's why he used Charlotte, who has the soul of a demon, and took on the form of a man to win her heart.

We don't know if he entered the temple to take advantage of Charlotte de Gradias, but he may have decided that it was more advantageous for him to assume a male form than a female one.

That's why I took on the persona of Reinhardt.

However, after being in the form of a man for so long, it must have been so frustrating that she wanted to return to her original form.

So I think she was expressing that inner need in a bizarre way by entering a cross-dressing contest.

Otherwise, Bertus couldn't see why a demon would enter a cross-dressing contest.

'When I think about it, I was closer to my female classmates because....... because of that?'

After all, it was a demon-human relationship and there was a sinister agenda, but if you consider that the female classmates hung out with him because they were more comfortable inside, it was not unreasonable for him to behave in a feminine way.

In the midst of his thoughts, Bertus was able to come to a conclusion about the Demoness, who had been tormenting him for so long with so little benefit.

The devil was a princess.

That explains everything.

He was plotting to use her to take over the empire, but deep down, he didn't want to forget who he really was.

Some.......

"......."

Bertus paused to think.
