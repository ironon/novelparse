Episode 301





Cannot be shown.

-Show me! Show me!

Kono Rint wanted to bite his tongue and die as he listened to the cries of the people in front of him.

"Do something stupid!

The moderator had no idea what to make of the superpower, but assumed it must be something special, and the audience was on the edge of their seats, eager to see what Royal Class had in store for them: teleportation.

If I suddenly teleported out of this spot in my underwear, this pageant venue would be a mess at worst and a laughingstock at best.

Your abilities are deeply flawed. So you can't show it.

I have to say that. I'm already embarrassed to be in public like this, and I don't want to do anything more embarrassing.

Because while people might want to see a skillful teleportation show, what they're really going to see is a very dangerous picture of a pervert in nothing but panties teleporting from bronze to bronze!

Just like that.

I have to say.

-Show me! Show me!

Conor Lint hears a cry directed at him, sees a gaze directed at him.

Even though you're standing here looking like this, you see their eyes on you.

It's an envious gaze.

It's a stare that Kono Lint has never received before.

The subtle jealousy, envy, and envy of those who are seen as royalty.

The boy has never been through it.

It's long since been stigmatized within the royal class as the same ability.

-Dude, that's awesome!

-Soon we'll be able to move the top with it, right?

-He, Chu, congratulations Lint.......

When I was able to move my underwear with me, my fellow psychic colleagues rejoiced.

It's the kind of pathetic ability that gets cheered and praised just for being less pathetic.

I don't think I'd ever be able to do what Reinhardt did, which is to travel around and do all these crazy things.

Or awakening superpowers while fighting a senior.

You're back from doing something crazy in Darkland.

Or awakening a magical enhancement at the end of a fight.

You win the first grade tournament with aplomb.

That kind of thing.

It's not your job to do things that make people's jaws drop.

But now, they're looking at themselves.

Just because they're royalty, just because they're superpowered.

Some people even said it was cute.

The first attention I've ever gotten in my life. What if I told them that they couldn't use their powers because they would strip them naked.

There's a useless guy like that in the Royal Class.

I wonder if that's going to change.

It was painful to imagine their excited stares turning to cold ones.

Useless abilities.

No, it's an awesome ability, but one that has too many critical flaws to be practical.

How long does it have to be like this?

Waiting to see what we can move with underwear next, and being happy with the small progress we've made.

I wonder, when am I ever going to be useful?

Kono Lint felt the cries of the people were distant. The moderator's chaegun also sounded like a distant echo.

With so many people in the spotlight, Kono Lint feels rather alone.

I don't want to be like Reinhardt.

He chooses to do things that are as dangerous as they are accomplished.

I don't want to live like that. I don't think I could.

However, I don't want to have to hunt and peck for risks like that dude with the stupidly handsome twin plates.

A little bit, though.

Like the world is being strangely generous to him.

Maybe I'm being a little generous.

How long do I have to go through life with these same powers, introducing myself as a psychic, but never being able to show it to anyone.

If Reinhardt taught me anything, it's this.

Recklessness sometimes has consequences.

Recklessness doesn't necessarily lead to failure.

Me too.

The world has something for you, too.

And I know that it's not going to be in my hands unless I try.

If a tree has fruit on it, and I don't take the risk of climbing the tree, the fruit will never be mine.

-show me!

Kono Lint brings us back to reality after a short but long hiatus.

The boy decided to do something.

His royal classmates, who had been sneering at him, were turning white. They had read something in the boy's determined expression.

-No! No!

Especially Riana de Granz, who was having the most fun so far, shaking her head in disbelief. While a moderate amount of embarrassment passes for humor, Riana is still not a naturally evil person.

The child is about to cross a river of no return, and you desperately try to stop him.

"No.

But Lint is no longer listening to anyone else.

I decided to do it.

Sometimes you have to move forward, even if it means failing.

-show me your brother!

It's not because of the squeaky-clean middle school girl in the front seat.

"Mr. Lindt, if you find the demonstration difficult, you can show me something else......."

And it's not because of the moderator who sits on the sidelines.

-show me!

And it's not because of the shouts of envy in the eyes of so many.

-Don't do it!

It's not for anyone.

Self.

You're tired of the stagnation and you're sick of yourself.

So, even though you can't live like Reinhardt, you decide to emulate the way he's done things in the past.

There is a point of no return, and that point is now.

Push yourself to the edge, and take the next step.

If it fails, it sucks.

If you succeed, you won't have to live on pennies anymore.

There is no more extreme situation than this.

Because I have to, I will.

"Something, let me show you."

-Waaaaaah!

Kono Lint, in her dress, strained her eyeballs.

I will complete my teleportation by moving my clothes along with me, and now I am truly on my way to becoming a psychic.

The coordinates to move are to the right of the stage.

The ability itself is easy to use.

I just can't figure out how to overcome the penalty.

I still don't know, but I'm determined to realize the extremes of teleportation in extreme situations.

"Suck!"

Kono Lindt clasped his hands together.

-pot!

-Oh!

In a flash.

A hush fell over the auditorium.

Kono Lint has successfully teleported.

-Urr......?

The audience was stunned.

"To......?"

The moderator was stunned.

-u......?

-What, what......?

And the royal classmates watching the scene were equally stunned-not by the predictable side effects, but by the sheer shock of seeing something so unexpected.

"......?"

And Kono Lint, who was present, was equally dumbfounded.

Clearly, Conor Lindt has succeeded in teleporting.

But his body was still there, right where he was.

It's the clothes that have been moved.

Kono Lint had all of his clothes, except his underwear, moved to the right side of the stage.

Conor Lindt was stunned.

So did my classmates.

ConoLint's capabilities have evolved.

What's happening now is ridiculous. That's why those in the know know that Kono Lint's capabilities have gone beyond quantum leaps and bounds to create something close to a miracle.

"Sue, did you know that teleportation is....... like this?"

"Uh, that, that....... Uh, no."

However, people, including the moderators, can't help but think that this is what Kono Lint's teleportation ability is supposed to do.

You didn't move yourself, you moved the clothes you were wearing.

Kono Lint has achieved miraculous ability growth.

-꺄아아아악!

But.

The end result was the same as if I were suddenly naked except for my panties.



* * *



-Well, that was entry number one, Konorint-kun!

Kono Lint fled to the back of the stage, and it took a while for the confusion of the students and audience, who were caught off guard by the suddenness of the situation, to settle down.

"What did I....... What did I just see......?"

Liana de Granz muttered, frozen in place.

This was partly due to Kono Lint's sudden underwear breeze, but also, of course, to the fact that he was using an ability unlike any other.

Heinrich, Caierdo, and Erich were equally baffled.

People don't know Lint, so it's inevitable that they're going to be stunned and dumbfounded. Because teleportation doesn't necessarily mean you're moving.

To those in the know, however, Kono Lint's success in sending objects, when all he had ever done was move his own body, was astonishing.

While the result is a ridiculous shifting of clothes, it's safe to say that the ability itself has evolved by leaps and bounds.

Some of the people who didn't know the truth looked like they had thrown up their hands in disbelief, while others thought it was cute to see Kono Lint running away in panic.

But the four who knew the truth were speechless for a while, their mouths hanging open.



* * *



-And that brings us to our next two contestants!

The moderator began to move the contest forward to clear up the confusion.

The four of them were there to see the ridiculousness of Cono Lint in the first place, so there was no point in sticking around now that it was over.

Of course, after all the contestants have introduced themselves, there's still the voting process to determine the winner. But that's enough for now.

Despite the shocking results, the important work is done and there's no reason to stay.

But the Royal Class Four, as well as others, didn't get a seat easily.

-What have you prepared for your appeal time?

-Let me show you the dance.

The contestants' antics were hilarious and kept me watching. Some of them were punished and some of them were voluntary, but they were all pretty funny in their own way.

"Hey, what is that? What is that?"

"Ack! Ack! If it's funny, it's funny, don't hit me!"

After the shock of Kono Lindt's revelation, Riana laughed, patting Erich de Lapaeri, who sat next to her.

"No, you're going to have to shave some leg hair, ahhh!"

Riana laughs as she slaps the person next to her.

"This is crazy....... Oh, my stomach hurts."

I've seen dancing, singing, and out-of-the-blue defeats for appeals.

When a cross-dressing music major nailed a soaring baritone solo, everyone clapped along.

After a few minutes of this cross-dressing contest, Riana clapped her hands as if she'd remembered something.

"Right!"

"Well, what's the point of....... You gonna hit me again?"

Erich flinched as Riana's eyes lit up as if she'd just remembered something.

"That's right! That's right! You know what!"

-pakpakpak!

Sure enough, he did it again.

"Oh, why does it keep hitting me......."

Liana pats Erich on the shoulder a few times, then looks at the Ganodab triplets and says, "You're right.

"There was a weird kid in the waiting room earlier."

"Weird kid?"

Erich asked, and Kai'er's expression turned strange.

"If any of the kids there don't look weird, that would be even weirder......?"

That's true, too.

In a waiting room full of cross-dressers, it's even weirder when you're the only one who isn't weird, because where there are weirdos, you're weird.

"No, there was a pretty girl in the back?"

Riana hesitated, then settled on a harsh phrase.

"......?"

"......?"

"......?"

I'd even go so far as to say that Riana is a stunningly pretty girl.

Of course, being the place that it is, it must be a man. Riana shook her head, remembering the weird kid she'd forgotten about in her shock earlier.

"I think it was 40 or something."

Riana was going to stay until then, if only out of curiosity, and the rest of her classmates were curious, too.

To what extent?

I'm just curious.

If a man cross-dresses and looks that good, what are you going to do?

None of the three understood why they were sitting there, but they didn't leave.

-All right, I give you entry number 24, Mr. Richard Howleman!

"......."

"......."

"......."

The appearance of the two-meter-plus dress made everyone want to cover their own eyes, and the moderator was freaking out.

"......I want to get out."

The corner of Riana's mouth twitched slightly, as if she'd seen him earlier but hadn't noticed.

-Uh hmm, big. Um....... ugh. Mmm. Uh, yeah. Ah.

It would be even worse if the muscular hunk was blushing and crossing her legs while tugging at the hem of her dress.

After a hilarious exchange between a broken moderator and an embarrassed cross-dresser, the moderator decided it was time to move on and went straight to the appeal.

-What have you prepared for your appeal?

-squat, let me show you.

Everyone watched in bewilderment as the humanoid suddenly demonstrated a high-weight squat in a one-piece.

It was ugly in a lot of ways, so there were a lot of escapees from that part.

Amidst the cheers and laughter, the cross-dressing contest was coming to a close.

-And now, the eighth edition of the highly anticipated crossdressing competition is down to its final contestant. A final contestant who is sure to surprise you in more ways than one. We can't reveal her real name because she's requested identity protection, but entry number 40, please come forward!

The 40 John Doe entries weren't the only ones, as there were quite a few who kept their class and name a secret.

Riana had already seen it once, and the other three onlookers were curious to see what it was like, given what she had said.

The last such participant.

John Doe #40 slowly walked onto the stage.

-with.......

The audience's reaction to contestant #40 walking out under the spotlight was a stunned gasp.





"What, what is......?"

"No......."

"What......?"

The reactions of the Royal Class students weren't much different. Even Riana, who had already seen it once, was frozen in place, staring blankly at number 40.

Silver hair that glistened in the light. It's a wig, of course, but the hair is so vibrant for a wig that it almost looks like her own hair.

Golden eyes, seductive full pink lips, a fine jawline and forehead, and a clean, slender white neckline.

She had slender shoulders and a perfect waist, although it was hidden by the hem of the dress.

There he was, smiling a gentle, kindly smile.

So the same question is bound to be on everyone's mind.

That's a man?

That's a lie.

-He, he....... I hate to break it to you, but....... Are you a cross-dressing contestant?

-Yes.

There, a neutral, subtle minor.

Rather than cheering or exclaiming, everyone was frozen in place. One of those "does this make sense?" moments.

-You asked to keep your identity secret, is there a reason?

For a moment, his face cracked as if a needle could fit through it. Number 40 quickly regained his expression.

-......Well, everyone has secrets.

-I see....... Do you usually dress like this?

-.......

At the moderator's provocative words, Number 40 stared at the moderator for a moment.

Everyone has just sensed a fleeting glimpse of No. 40's true expression, but no one has seen it clearly. Quickly recovering his smile, Number 40 smirks and says, "I'm sorry.

-No, not at all.

-You mean this is your first time?

-Yes.

It looks fine, but people are watching.

Her expression was as nonchalant as a steel wall, but Number 40 was now clutching the hem of her dress.

It was clear that he was very nervous. His face was getting redder and redder, and it was clear that he was very embarrassed about the situation.
